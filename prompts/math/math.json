      "solution": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{x + y}{n}$. This leads to \n\\[\n3x(n - 4) = 2y(6 - n).\n\\]\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\nFinal answer: 5"
