    "input": "You are given a script of a TV episode. Summarize the episode in a paragraph.\n\nEpisode Script:\nOpening scene - Hospital - the first thing we see is a black screen with the sound of a siren, and what sounds like a dispatch message. I cannot make out the actual words sorry. we see the hospital doors open and paramedics rushing a stretcher inside, there is a bright light so its difficult to see everything - all the talking in this scene is very echoey, and distant. it's very reflective of the situation. there are also a few voiceovers from 224, which I think were done great!)\nParamedic: I got a gun shot wound exited the right clavicle, punctured an artery\n(we see a close up of Trey, and the other paramedic is holding a breathing thing over his mouth. a doctor comes down the corridor, putting a gown on)\nDr: he still alive\nParamedic: not for long\nV.O Ryan: how could you man...I would'a done anything for you\n(we see Trey kind of moving his head a little, then we see the ceiling of the hospital as if we are seeing what Trey is seeing. we then see Ryan & Marissa coming in through the hospital doors, they both look worried and scared)\nV.O Trey: look man, it was messed up, I was stoned\n(an officer comes into the shot and walks over to Ryan and Marissa as they are coming in)\nOfficer: we've still got some more questions for you\n(Ryan walks passed the officer and over towards Trey)\nRyan: I've jus gotta see if he's gonna be ok\n(we see Trey, still with the breathing thing over his mouth, being pushed away. there is another voice over here but its at the same time as the next line so I cant tell what it is, its possibly a scream/cry from Marissa)\nMarissa: (worried, to a nurse) he's not gonna die, right\n(behind Marissa we see Seth and Summer enter, they both look worried as well, and they are looking in the direction of Marissa/Ryan/Trey. behind them we can see the ambulance Trey came out of)\nV.O Ryan: it wasn't my idea Trey, I didn't wanna steal that car\n(we see another shot of Trey, which is a close up of his bloody face, and a little of his chest. here we see a bit of the hospital roof and light, but also blended into it is the scene where Trey pulled the gun on Ryan at his apartment in 224. its been done similar to how we saw the Ryan/Marissa 'who are you' scene during the Ryan/Lindsay car conversation of 208 . its a blink and you'll miss it deal :))\nV.O Trey: hey man I went away for it an uh you got the good life\nV.O Ryan: so you had to destroy it, you had to hurt her, huh\n(the last thing we see is Trey pointing the gun at Ryan, then we see the hospital light again and Trey being rushed down the corridor. Ryan comes around the corner, behind Trey, the doctor and the paramedics)\nRyan: hey, he's my brother, is he gonna be ok\nDr: he'd be better if someone hadn't shot him\n(the Dr and paramedics move the stretcher closer to the bed, nurses are also there)\nDr: he's lost alot of blood so (turns around and sees Ryan) Jesus what the hell happened'a you\nRyan: (looks at Dr) nothing I'm fine\nDr: (yells) could someone look at this kid\n(Ryan turns away from the Dr and everything goes blurry)\nOfficer: just as soon as we're done talking to him\n(we see a close up of Ryan, and he has a noticeable bruise, and bloody nose, he also looks out of it. he looks away from the officer and back at Trey. we see Trey being moved over to the bed, then someone squeezing the breathing thing over his mouth. we then see Marissa and Summer standing together near the hospital doors, an officer is with them)\nMarissa: (yells) Ryan\n(Ryan turns to face Marissa, she puts her hand out to Ryan helplessly)\nOfficer: (holding the gun) did you discharge this weapon man\nMarissa: (looks at officer, frustrated) yes I already t-\nRyan: (yells urgently) don't answer him, don't say anything\n(the officer near Ryan looks over towards Marissa, shocked. Marissa looks at Ryan and shrugs. the background goes out of focus, Seth comes into the shot clearly on the right hand side)\nSeth: you ok (Ryan looks at him)\nDr: we're losing him\n(Ryan turns towards where they are working on Trey. we see a very quick flashback of Trey and Ryan, then we see them still working on Trey, squeezing the breathing thing. Ryan looks away from Trey and back towards Seth, dazed. we see how Ryan is seeing, which is Seth as wavy, then squashed/ stretched)\nSeth: you alright\n(Ryan looks at Seth, blinking and breathing heavily. his vision is now bordering on blurry. we can see Marissa out of focus in the background still. Sandy comes through the hospital doors)\nSandy: Ryan (Ryan looks at him, still blinking and dazed) Seth...you ok\n(Ryan is now seeing Sandy as short/fat, and wavy. we see Ryan looking at Sandy & Seth, growing more and more disoriented till he falls and passes out on the floor. we see what he is seeing as he falls, then we hear the thud and see Ryan on his stomach next to Treys bed. - we then abruptly cut to the pool house where Ryan has jolted himself awake. he blinks and slightly lifts his head, we can see a bit of sun on his cheek. he looks freaked out. he then lifts his head more and opens his eyes wider. he rubs his hand down his face, and sniffs. we then see Ryan sitting up on his elbow in bed, we can also see a silhouette at his door, and then we hear a knock. Seth opens the door and walks in, in true Seth style, lol)\nSeth: hey man, I jus wanted you ta know that uh (stops and looks at Ryan worried) you ok\nRyan: (looks at Seth, then looks away and sighs) I just had the worst nightmare (raises eyebrows)\nSeth: yeah, I got some...bad news\nRyan: it wasn't a dream (closes eyes) yeah, yeah I know (opens eyes)\nSeth: well that lawyer guys on his way over so...\nRyan: (softly) thankyou\n(Seth turns and leaves. we see a close up of Ryan who looks worried)\nCooper-Nichol veranda - we see an aerial shot of the pool, and Marissa and Summer sun-baking beside it. think 201. it then changes to a front on shot of them, but it's as if it's on top of the pool water, half way through Summers line it changes to a close up of them. Marissa has her head back, with sunglasses on\nSummer: you know Coop, if you had of asked what we'd be doing the weekend before senior year (thinks) I probably would've said a road trip to Rosarito or rush week at SU with college boys\nMarissa: an waiting to get charged with manslaughter\nSummer: (shakes head) wouldnt'a made the list (looks at Marissa) mm-mm...(reassuringly) your gonna get through this Coop (looks at Marissa with one eye open, one closed from the sun) your innocent you were saving Ryan's life\nMarissa: (lifts head) try explaining that to Ryan\nSummer: he understands why you did it he's not mad (shakes head)\nMarissa: its jus like this... weird horrible thing (lays head back) hanging over us...like the elephant in the room...or an intensive care unit\nSummer: (frowns) before Trey I never actually knew anyone in a coma (shakes head) well I mean on the valley there's someone in a coma (Marissa frowns) like every week but I think they only do that so that when the person wakes up another actor can play the part (nods, confidently)\nMarissa: (raises eyebrows) unfortunately if Trey wakes up he's still gonna be Trey...if he wakes up (looks down)\nSummer: you've got'to admit Coop (Marissa looks at her) whatever happens, Ryan facing off with Trey to avenge your honour, god that is SO-FREAKING-HOT (Marissa doesn't say anything) ...in a mythic, biblical, Samurai Western kind of way\nMarissa: I really wish that helped me sleep at night Summer (puts head back)\nSummer: (frowns, concerned) you're still not sleeping\nMarissa: I shot someone Sum (Summer looks at her, then away) an even if he lives, which...is a big if, I'm still gonna have'to live with that for the rest of my life\nSummer: (nods) oh (puts head back & closes eyes) senior year\nMarissa: (scoffs) should be all time (half smiles)\n(we see the backs of the pool chairs and a shot of the house)\nCUT TO: Cohen kitchen - Sandy pours a whole pot of coffee into a tall mug\nDDA: thaaanks a bunch, Sandy\nSandy: if a pot'n a half isn't enough to get you through the morning (holds out mug) I can make some more\nDDA: that'd be great (drinks)\n(Sandy looks at the DA and then picks up the pot to refill it)\nSandy: sorry for the mess, its ben a little hectic (looks over) Seth'll be right down\nDDA: (frowns) and Mr. Atwood\nSandy: he's gettin' dressed, well the kids've ben through alot this summer with all this hangin over them, and now school is starting\nDDA: which is why the DA wants to get moving, we waited as long as we could for the other Mr. Atwood to wake up but I'm getting alotta calls from parents...DA's under alotta pressure ta prosecute (drinks)\nSandy: except there's nothin ta prosecute, Marissa's protected under the defense of others (looks at DDA) of course your boss may not find that very sexy\nDDA: quite true...(looks at Sandy) DA's not lookin to go after Marissa\nSandy: (looks at DDA, annoyed) Ryan's innocent...you got his statement at the scene an hers\nDDA: look at the record Ryan's got, his history of violence...an Caleb Nichols daughters the one blowin away ex cons with a forty five\nSandy: (looks at DDA) she saved Ryan's life\nDDA: what was he doin over at Treys in the first place, his brother tried to rape his girlfriend (Sandy pours more coffee) we've got cause\nSandy: yeah, an ya got witnesses\nDDA: well the only people who saw the gun go off were Mr. Atwood Miss Cooper an the other Mr. Atwood, who (raises eyebrows) may or may not wake up\nSandy: (turns to face DDA) if you go after Ryan even if he's brought in on charges...social services could take him away from us\nDDA: which explains Miss Coopers motivation to cover for him (nods confidently) Mr. Atwood's got alot more to lose\n(Sandy glares at the DDA then turns back to the coffee)\nDDA: where is your wife anyway\nSandy: (sighs) she's outta town\nCUT TO: Suriak Treatment Centre garden - we see a close up of Kirsten, as the scene goes on we see that she is in a group therapy session and Dr Woodruff is there leading it\nKirsten: my name is Kirsten an I'm an alcoholic\nGroup: hi Kirsten\n(we can now see they are all seated on chairs around the fountain)\nDr W: Kirsten your progress here at Suriak has ben...truly wonderful to watch (nods) your a model patient for...everyone here\n(everyone looks towards Kirsten, however one patient near Kirsten looks more interested than the rest. a woman who is one person away from Kirsten, we find out later her name is Charlotte)\nKirsten: (shy) well I don't know about that...I mean Shelley is definitely better at poker (Shelley looks worried) she's cleaned me out\n(everyone laughs)\nKirsten: (smiles, looks down) but...being here has given me the clarity to understand...why I turned to alcohol in the first place\nDr W: an...do you feel comfortable sharing with the group uh why that was\nKirsten: uh sure...I mean we're all in this together...I uh (thinks) I guess it begins and ends with my dad (nods, frowns) he was (shakes head, closes eyes) an amazing man (shrugs) but controlling...and...I realised that I was living his life not mine (Dr W listens) after my mother died I did everything (Charlotte is listening intently) I could to please him (sighs) but I realised that no matter how hard I worked or how hard I tried-\nCharlotte: it was never enough (Kirsten looks at her) ...I'm sorry\nKirsten: (suprised) uh, no (looks at Charlotte) no its true it was never enough, became my mantra (smiles) ...I was never a good enough wife or a mom (raises eyebrows) because I wasn't a good enough daughter\nDr W: (points at Kirsten) the power that comes with that kind of difficult realisation, will be invaluable after you leave us\nKirsten: are you trying'to get rid'a me (smiles)\n(everyone laughs)\nDr W: well, it sounds to me like uh Suriak's work is done (Kirsten smiles, then looks unsure) you'll need ta get a sponsor...an attend meetings...but there's no reason you can't do that from your home\n(Charlotte looks at Kirsten, as if she knows Kirsten isn't ready yet)\nKirsten: great (forces a smile)\nCUT TO: Cohen dining room - Ryan is sitting on one side of the table with his hands clasped together in front of him, and the DDA is sitting opposite him. Sandy is standing at the end of the table, close by. this scene changes between Ryan and Seth, kind of a blend of their 2 depositions so you'll know who's it was depending on who is talking, Ryan or Seth\nDDA: Mr. Atwood (Ryan looks away) do you swear to tell the truth an nothing but the truth so help you god-\nRyan: (fed up) I do (sighs)\nDDA: well then you won't mind if I record this deposition (slides recorder across the table)\nSeth: sure, record it, release it on ITunes, I hope it's a really big hit\nSandy: (not amused) just answer the questions\nRyan: (looks at Sandy) I've already answered all of these questions (looks at DDA) I have nothing new'to say (looks down)\nDDA: well your previous statement came at the hospital...it was traumatic its ben a couple'a months maybe you remember things differently now\nSeth: I remember everything exactly as I told you\nDDA: well then you can tell me again\nRyan: ...I (leans forward) confronted Trey about what had happened and that's when he pulled the gun on me\nSeth: then we called Marissa to see if maybe she could stop Ryan\nRyan: an that's when Marissa saved my life\nDDA: you mean, that's when Marissa shot Trey (Seth nods) an you witnessed the shooting\nSeth: well it was clear w- when we got there what had happened\nDDA: just answer the question\nRyan: (yells, fed up) no I did not (calmer) I didn't- (raises eyebrows) an-an an I didn't shoot him (Sandy looks at DDA)\nDDA: young fingerprints are on the gun\nRyan: yeah because I put the safety back on to make sure it didn't go off again\n(we see a close up of the recorder)\nRyan: we-we (agitated, sighs) ...we weren't exactly thinking at the time\nDDA: so one final question, what were you afraid (frowns) was going to happen between Ryan an his brother...why were you trying to stop him\n(Seth doesn't say anything, Sandy looks down)\nDDA: you went to Treys that night to kill your brother (Ryan looks at him) didn't you Mr. Atwood\n(Ryan swallows and doesn't say anything. we see a close up of the recorder just as it stops recording)\nCUT TO: Cooper-Nichol veranda - Jimmy is setting the table and Julie is in front of him looking at herself in the reflection of a window\nJimmy: (puts plate down) so what kind'a food d'you think prosecutors like\nJulie: (fixes hair) cause that's what's important here Jimmy (sighs, turns around) ok so (holds out hands) does this look like the outfit the mother of an innocent girl would wear\nJimmy: yeah well at least somebody has their priorities in order...\nJulie: (sighs) I just hope Marissa listens to me, and our attorney, the last thing we need is her admitting ta the DA that she shot someone\nJimmy: Jules (looks at Julie, confused) she already admitted it\nJulie: she wasn't in a right frame of mind when she spoke to the police...its not like she's a trained assassin\nJimmy: uh-huh so-so (frowns) what's our story, Trey shot himself...in the back\nJulie: no, Jimmy, be reasonable\nJimmy: she's not gonna lie an say Ryan did it, they already have her statement\nJulie: nobody believes her, they all think she's protecting him\nJimmy: (looks at Julie) so you want Ryan to go away for this\nJulie: ...all I know is that before he moved to Newport our lives were alot more normal, stable\nJimmy: (nods) uh-huh so it's his fault that I went bankrupt an nearly went to jail, an you married Caleb Nichol (raises eyebrows) only to watch him drown in a pool annnn Trey got shot (moves closer to Julie)\nJulie: (not amused) Jimmy, not everything I say is meant literally, I'm venting (faces Jimmy) look I wish none'a this ever happened but it did, an we have a chance to be a family again...I don't wanna lose that (Jimmy puts his hand on her shoulder) l w- put out some crudit\u00e9s' an the guda ill go see if Marissa's out of the shower\n(Julie goes inside and Jimmy turns around, looking worried)\nCUT TO: Pool House - Ryan comes out of the bathroom with a towel over his shoulder and Seth comes to the open doors from outside\nSeth: (calls out) hey, you decent (Ryan shuts the bathroom door) thought maybe you could...use a post-depo-dip\nRyan: (holds up the towel) I just showered\nSeth: mmm a fair point, then we'll stay away from aquatic activity something land locked maybe\nRyan: (thinks) I'm gonna visit Trey\nSeth: I was gonna go with a movie, this bein the time when Hollywood dumps their crappy would be blockbusters which we could mock (touches his chest) an thus feel better about ourselves\nRyan: (ignoring Seth, stands) you got the keys (raises eyebrows)\nSeth: but (puts up finger) visiting your comatose brother in the I.C.U that's...also an excellent way ta relax an blow off steam so ill drive\nRyan: awesome\n(Seth turns around and goes out the doors.
