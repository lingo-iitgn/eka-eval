BOND\n\n\n\n\n   The Callisto-bound\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   needed\n\n\n   a cook. What it got was a piping-voiced\n\n\n   Jonah who jinxed it straight into Chaos.\n\n\n\n\n   We picked up our new cook on Phobos. Not Phoebus or Phoebe; I mean\n Phobos, Mars' inner moon. Our regular victual mangler came down with\n acute indigestion\u2014tasted some of his own cooking, no doubt\u2014when we\n were just one blast of a jet-tube out of Sand City spaceport. But since\n we were rocketing under sealed orders, we couldn't turn back.\n\n\n\n\n   So we laid the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   down on Phobos' tiny cradle-field and bundled\n our ailing grub-hurler off to a hospital, and the skipper said to me,\n \"Mister Dugan,\" he said, \"go out and find us a cook!\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Aye, sir!\" I said, and went.\n\n\n\n\n   Only it wasn't that easy. In those days, Phobos had only a handful\n of settlers, and most of them had good-paying jobs. Besides, we were\n at war with the Outer Planets, and no man in his right senses wanted\n to sign for a single-trip jump on a rickety old patrolship bound for\n nobody-knew-where. And, of course, cooks are dime-a-dozen when you\n don't need one, but when you've got to locate one in a hurry they're as\n difficult to find as petticoats in a nudist camp.\n\n\n\n\n   I tried the restaurants and the employment agencies, but it was no\n dice. I tried the hotels and the tourist homes and even one or two\n of the cleaner-looking joy-joints. Again I drew a blank. So, getting\n desperate, I audioed a plaintive appeal to the wealthy Phobosian\n colonists, asking that one of the more patriotic sons-of-riches donate\n a chef's services to the good old I.P.S., but my only response was a\n loud silence.\n\n\n\n\n   So I went back to the ship. I said, \"Sorry, sir. We're up against it. I\n can't seem to find a cook on the whole darned satellite.\"\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper scowled at me from under a corduroy brow and fumed, \"But\n we've got to have a cook, Dugan! We can't go on without one!\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"In a pinch,\" I told him, \"\n\n\n    I\n\n\n   might be able to boil a few pies, or\n scramble us a steak or something, Skipper.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Thanks, Dugan, but that won't do. On this trip the men must be fed\n regularly and well. Makeshift meals are O.Q. on an ordinary run, but\n when you're running the blockade\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   He stopped abruptly. But too late; I had caught his slip of the tongue.\n I stared at him. I said, \"The blockade, sir? Then you've read our\n orders?\"\n\n\n\n\n   The Old Man nodded soberly.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Yes. You might as well know, Lieutenant. Everyone will be told as soon\n as the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   lifts gravs again. My orders were to be opened four hours\n after leaving Sand City. I read them a few minutes ago.\n\n\n\n\n   \"We are to attempt to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade at any\n spot which reconnaisance determines as favorable. Our objective is\n Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Solar Federation Intelligence\n Department has learned of a loyalist uprising on that moon. It is\n reported that Callisto is weary of the war, with a little prompting\n will secede from the Alliance and return to the Federation.\n\n\n\n\n   \"If this is true, it means we have at last found the foothold we have\n been seeking; a salient within easy striking distance of Jupiter,\n capital of the Alliance government. Our task is to verify the rumor\n and, if it be true, make a treaty with the Callistans.\"\n\n\n\n\n   I said, \"Sweet howling stars\u2014some assignment, sir! A chance to end\n this terrible war ... form a permanent union of the entire Solar\n family ... bring about a new age of prosperity and happiness.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"If,\" Cap O'Hara reminded me, \"we succeed. But it's a tough job. We\n can't expect to win through the enemy cordon unless our men are in top\n physical condition. And that means a sound, regular diet. So we must\n find a cook, or\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"The search,\" interrupted an oddly high-pitched, but not unpleasant\n voice, \"is over. Where's the galley?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I whirled, and so did the Old Man. Facing us was an outlandish little\n figure; a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two\n in height; a smooth-cheeked young fellow swaddled in a spaceman's\n uniform at least three sizes too large. Into the holster of his harness\n was thrust a Haemholtz ray-pistol big enough to burn an army, and in\n his right hand he brandished a huge, gleaming carving-knife. He frowned\n at us impatiently.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Well,\" he repeated impatiently, \"where is it?\"\n\n\n\n\n   The Old Man stared.\n\n\n\n\n   \"W-who,\" he demanded dazedly, \"might you be?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"I might be,\" retorted the little stranger, \"lots of people. But I came\n here to be your new cook.\"\n\n\n\n\n   O'Hara said, \"The new\u2014What's your name, mister?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Andy,\" replied the newcomer. \"Andy Laney.\"\n\n\n\n\n   The Old Man's lip curled speculatively. \"Well, Andy Laney,\" he said,\n \"you don't look like much of a cook to\n\n\n    me\n\n\n   .\"\n\n\n\n\n   But the little mugg just returned the Old Man's gaze coolly. \"Which\n makes it even,\" he retorted. \"\n\n\n    You\n\n\n   don't look like much of a skipper\n to\n\n\n    me\n\n\n   . Do I get the job, or don't I?\"\n\n\n\n\n   The captain's grin faded, and his jowls turned pink. I stepped forward\n hastily. I said, \"Excuse me, sir, shall I handle this?\" Then, because\n the skipper was still struggling for words: \"You,\" I said to the little\n fellow, \"are a cook?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"One of the best!\" he claimed complacently.\n\n\n\n\n   \"You're willing to sign for a blind journey?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Would I be here,\" he countered, \"if I weren't?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"And you have your space certificate?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"I\u2014\" began the youngster.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Smart Aleck!\" That was the Old Man, exploding into coherence at last.\n \"Rat-tailed, clever-cracking little smart Aleck! Don't look like much\n of a skipper, eh? Well, my fine young rooster\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   I said quickly, \"If you don't mind, sir, this is no time to worry over\n trifles. 'Any port in a storm,' you know. And if this young man\n\n\n    can\n\n\n   cook\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper's color subsided. So did he, grumbling. \"Well, perhaps\n you're right, Dugan. All right, Slops, you're hired. The galley's\n on the second level, port side. Mess in three quarters of an\n hour. Get going! Dugan, call McMurtrie and tell him we lift gravs\n immediately\u2014\n\n\n    Slops!\n\n\n   What are you doing at that table?\"\n\n\n\n\n   For the little fellow had sidled across the control-room and now, eyes\n gleaming inquisitively, was peering at our trajectory charts. At the\n skipper's roar he glanced up at us eagerly.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Vesta!\" he piped in that curiously high-pitched and mellow voice.\n \"Loft trajectory for Vesta! Then we're trying to run the Alliance\n blockade, Captain?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"None of your business!\" bellowed O'Hara in tones of thunderous\n outrage. \"Get below instantly, or by the lavendar lakes of Luna I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"If I were you,\" interrupted our diminutive new chef thoughtfully, \"I'd\n try to broach the blockade off Iris rather than Vesta. For one thing,\n their patrol line will be thinner there; for another, you can come in\n through the Meteor Bog, using it as a cover.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"\n\n\n    Mr. Dugan!\n\n\n   \"\n\n\n\n\n   The Old Man's voice had an ominous ring to it, one I had seldom heard.\n I sprang to attention and saluted smartly. \"Aye, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Take this\u2014this culinary tactician out of my sight before I forget I'm\n an officer and a gentleman. And tell him that when I want advice I'll\n come down to the galley for it!\"\n\n\n\n\n   A hurt look crept into the youngster's eyes. Slowly he turned and\n followed me from the turret, down the ramp, and into the pan-lined\n cubicle which was his proper headquarters. When I was turning to leave\n he said apologetically, \"I didn't mean any harm, Mr. Dugan. I was just\n trying to help.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"You must learn not to speak out of turn, youngster,\" I told him\n sternly. \"The Old Man's one of the smartest space navigators who ever\n lifted gravs. He doesn't need the advice or suggestions of a cook.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"But I was raised in the Belt,\" said the little chap plaintively. \"I\n know the Bog like a book. And I was right; our safest course\n\n\n    is\n\n\n   by\n way of Iris.\"\n\n\n\n\n   Well, there you are! You try to be nice to someone, and what happens?\n He tees off on you. I got a little sore I guess. Anyhow, I told the\n little squirt off, but definitely.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Now, listen!\" I said bluntly. \"You volunteered for the job. Now\n you've got to take what comes with it: orders! From now on, suppose\n you take care of the cooking and let the rest of us worry about the\n ship\u2014Captain Slops!\"\n\n\n\n\n   And I left, banging the door behind me hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   So we hit the spaceways for Vesta, and after a while the Old Man called\n up the crew and told them our destination, and if you think they were\n scared or nervous or anything like that, why, you just don't know\n spacemen. From oil-soaked old Jock McMurtrie, the Chief Engineer, all\n the way down the line to Willy, our cabin-boy, the\n\n\n    Leo's\n\n\n   complement\n was as thrilled as a sub-deb at an Academy hop.\n\n\n\n\n   John Wainwright, our First Officer, licked his chops like a fox in a\n hen-house and said, \"The blockade! Oboyoboy! Maybe we'll tangle with\n one of the Alliance ships, hey?\"\n\n\n\n\n   Blinky Todd, an ordinary with highest rating, said with a sort of\n macabre satisfaction, \"I hopes we\n\n\n    do\n\n\n   meet up with 'em, that's whut I\n does, sir! Never did have no love for them dirty, skulkin' Outlanders,\n that's whut I didn't!\"\n\n\n\n\n   And one of the black-gang blasters, a taciturn chap, said nothing\u2014but\n the grim set of his jaw and the purposeful way he spat on his callused\n paws were mutely eloquent.\n\n\n\n\n   Only one member of the crew was absent from the conclave. Our new\n Slops. He was busy preparing midday mess, it seems, because scarcely\n had the skipper finished talking than the audio hummed and a cheerful\n call rose from the galley:\n\n\n\n\n   \"Soup's on! Come and get it!\"\n\n\n\n\n   Which we did. And whatever failings \"Captain Slops\" might have, he\n had not exaggerated when he called himself one of the best cooks in\n space. That meal, children, was a meal! When it comes to victuals\n I can destroy better than describe, but there was stuff and things\n and such-like, all smothered in gravy and so on, and huge quantities\n of this and that and the other thing, all of them unbelievably\n dee-luscious!\n\n\n\n\n   Beyond a doubt it was the finest feast we of the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   had enjoyed in\n a 'coon's age. Even the Old Man admitted that as, leaning back from\n the table, he patted the pleasant bulge due south of his belt buckle.\n He rang the bell that summoned Slops from the galley, and the little\n fellow came bustling in apprehensively.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Was everything all right, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Not only all right, Slops,\" wheezed Captain O'Hara, \"but perfect!\n Accept my congratulations on a superb meal, my boy. Did you find\n everything O.Q. in the galley?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Captain Slops\" blushed like a stereo-struck school-gal, and fidgeted\n from one foot to another.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you very much. Yes, the galley was in fine\n order. That is\u2014\" He hesitated\u2014\"there is one little thing, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"So? Well, speak up, son, what is it? I'll get it fixed for you right\n away.\" The Old Man smiled archly. \"Must have everything shipshape for a\n tip-top chef, what?\"\n\n\n\n\n   The young hash-slinger still hesitated bashfully.\n\n\n\n\n   \"But it's such a\n\n\n    little\n\n\n   thing, sir, I almost hate to bother you with\n it.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"No trouble at all. Just say the word.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Well, sir,\" confessed Slops reluctantly, \"I need an incinerator in\n the galley. The garbage-disposal system in there now is old-fashioned,\n inconvenient and unsanitary. You see, I have to carry the waste down\n two levels to the rocket-chamber in order to expel it.\"\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper's brow creased.\n\n\n\n\n   \"I'm sorry, Slops,\" he said, \"but I don't see how we can do anything\n about that. Not just now, at any rate. That job requires equipment we\n don't have aboard. After this jump is over I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Oh, I realize we don't have the regular equipment,\" said Slops shyly,\n \"but I've figured out a way to get the same effect with equipment we\n do have. There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom.\n If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an\n incinerator.\"\n\n\n\n\n   I said, \"Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against\n regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be\n placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions\n of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy\n ordnance.'\"\n\n\n\n\n   Our little chef's face fell. \"Now, that's too bad,\" he said\n discouragedly. \"I was planning a special banquet for tomorrow, with\n roast marsh-duck and all the fixings, pinberry pie\u2014but, oh, well!\u2014if\n I have no incinerator\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper's eyes bulged, and he drooled like a pup at a barbeque.\n He was a bit of a sybarite, was Captain David O'Hara; if there was\n anything he dearly loved to exercise his molars on it was Venusian\n marsh-duck topped with a dessert of Martian pinberry pie. He said:\n\n\n\n\n   \"We-e-ell, now, Mr. Dugan, let's not be too technical. After all, that\n rule was put in the book only to prevent persons which shouldn't ought\n to do so from having control of ordnance. But that isn't what Slops\n wants the cannon for, is it, son? So I don't see any harm in rigging\n up the old Nolan in the galley for incineration purposes. Did you say\n\n\n    all\n\n\n   the fixings, Slops?\"\n\n\n\n\n   Maybe I was mistaken, but for a moment I suspected I caught a queer\n glint in our little chef's eyes; it might have been gratitude, or, on\n the other hand, it might have been self-satisfaction. Whatever it was\n it passed quickly, and Captain Slops' soft voice was smooth as silk\n when he said:\n\n\n\n\n   \"Yes, Captain, all the fixings. I'll start cooking the meal as soon as\n the new incinerator is installed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   So that was that. During the night watch two men of the crew lugged\n the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I\n found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and\n thorough cleaning. The way he was oiling and scrubbing at that antique\n reminded me of an apprentice gunner coddling his first charge.\n\n\n\n\n   I must have startled him, entering unexpectedly as I did, for when I\n said, \"Hi, there!\" he jumped two feet and let loose a sissy little\n piping squeal. Then, crimson-faced with embarrassment, he said, \"Oh,\n h-hello, Lieutenant. I was just getting my new incinerator shipshape.\n Looks O.Q., eh?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"If you ask me,\" I said, \"it looks downright lethal. The Old Man must\n be off his gravs to let a young chuckle-head like you handle that toy.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"But I'm only going to use it,\" he said plaintively, \"to dispose of\n garbage.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Well, don't dump your cans when there are any ships within range,\" I\n warned him glumly, \"or there'll be a mess of human scraps littering up\n the void. That gun may be a museum piece, but it still packs a wallop.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Yes, sir,\" said Slops meekly. \"I'll be careful how I use it, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\n   I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me\n of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Speaking of being careful, did you hear the giggler about the old maid\n at the Martian baths? Well, it seems this perennial spinster wandered,\n by accident, into the men's shower room and met up with a brawny young\n prospector\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   Captain Slops said, \"Er\u2014excuse me, Lieutenant, but I have to get this\n marsh-duck stuffed.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Plenty of time, Slops. Wait till you hear this; it will kill you. The\n old maid got flustered and said, 'Oh, I'm sorry! I must be in the wrong\n compartment\u2014'\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"If you don't mind, Mr. Dugan,\" interrupted the cook loudly, \"I'm\n awfully busy. I don't have any time for\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"The prospector looked her over carefully for a couple of seconds; then\n answered, 'That's O.Q. by me, sister. I won't\u2014'\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"I\u2014I've got to go now, Lieutenant,\" shouted Slops. \"Just remembered\n something I've got to get from stores.\" And without even waiting to\n hear the wallop at the end of my tale he fled from the galley, very\n pink and flustered.\n\n\n\n\n   So there was one for the log-book! Not only did our emergency chef lack\n a sense of humor, but the little punk was bashful, as well! Still, it\n was no skin off my nose if Slops wanted to miss the funniest yarn of a\n decade. I shrugged and went back to the control turret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   All that, to make an elongated story brief, happened on the first day\n out of Mars. As any schoolchild knows, it's a full hundred million from\n the desert planet to the asteroid belt. In those days, there was no\n such device as a Velocity-Intensifier unit, and the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   , even though\n she was then considered a reasonably fast little patroller, muddled\n along at a mere 400,000 m.p.h. Which meant it would take us at least\n ten days, perhaps more, to reach that disputed region of space around\n Vesta, where the Federation outposts were sparse and the Alliance block\n began.\n\n\n\n\n   That period of jetting was a mingled joy and pain in the britches.\n Captain Slops was responsible for both.\n\n\n\n\n   For one thing, as I've hinted before, he was a bit of a panty-waist.\n It wasn't so much the squeaky voice or the effeminate gestures he cut\n loose with from time to time. One of the roughest, toughest scoundrels\n who ever cut a throat on Venus was \"High G\" Gordon, who talked like a\n boy soprano, and the meanest pirate who ever highjacked a freighter was\n \"Runt\" Hake\u2014who wore diamond ear-rings and gold fingernail polish!\n\n\n\n\n   But it was Slops' general attitude that isolated him from the command\n and crew. In addition to being a most awful prude, he was a kill-joy.\n When just for a lark we begged him to boil us a pot of spaghetti, so we\n could pour a cold worm's nest into Rick Bramble's bed, he shuddered and\n refused.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Certainly not!\" he piped indignantly. \"You must be out of your minds!\n I never heard of such a disgusting trick! Of course, I won't be a party\n to it. Worms\u2014Ugh!\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Yeah!\" snorted Johnny Wainwright disdainfully, \"And\n\n\n    ugh!\n\n\n   to you,\n too. Come on, Joe, let's get out of here before we give Slops bad\n dreams and goose-flesh!\"\n\n\n\n\n   Nor was hypersensitiveness Slops' worst failing. If he was squeamish\n about off-color jokes and such stuff, he had no compunctions whatsoever\n against sticking his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\n\n\n\n   He was an inveterate prowler. He snooped everywhere and anywhere from\n ballast-bins to bunk-rooms. He quizzed the Chief about engine-room\n practices, the gunner's mate on problems of ballistics, even the\n cabin-boy on matters of supplies and distribution of same. He was not\n only an asker; he was a teller, as well. More than once during the next\n nine days he forced on the skipper the same gratuitous advice which\n before had enraged the Old Man. By sheer perseverance he earned the\n title I had tagged him with: \"Captain Slops.\"\n\n\n\n\n   I was willing to give him another title, too\u2014Captain Chaos. God knows\n he created enough of it!\n\n\n\n\n   \"It's a mistake to broach the blockade at Vesta,\" he argued over and\n over again.\n\n\n\n\n   \"O.Q., Slops,\" the skipper would nod agreeably, with his mouth full\n of some temper-softening tidbit, \"you're right and I'm wrong, as you\n usually are. But I'm in command of the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   , and you ain't. Now, run\n along like a good lad and bring me some more of this salad.\"\n\n\n\n\n   So ten days passed, and it was on the morning of the eleventh day out\n of Sand City that we ran into trouble with a capital trub. I remember\n that morning well, because I was in the mess-hall having breakfast with\n Cap O'Hara, and Slops was playing another variation on the old familiar\n theme.\n\n\n\n\n   \"I glanced at the chart this morning, sir,\" he began as he minced in\n with a platterful of golden flapjacks and an ewer of Vermont maple\n syrup, \"and I see we are but an hour or two off Vesta. I am very much\n afraid this is our last chance to change course\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"And for that,\" chuckled the Old Man, \"Hooray! Pass them pancakes, son.\n Maybe now you'll stop shooting off about how we ought to of gone by way\n of Iris. Mmmm! Good!\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Thank you, sir,\" said Slops mechanically. \"But you realize there is\n extreme danger of encountering enemy ships?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Keep your pants on, Slops!\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Eh?\" The chef looked startled. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"I said keep your pants on. Sure, I know. And I've took precautions.\n There's a double watch on duty, and men at every gun. If we do meet up\n with an Alliance craft, it'll be just too bad for them!\n\n\n\n\n   \"Yes, sirree!\" The Old Man grinned comfortably. \"I almost hope we\n do bump into one. After we burn it out of the void we'll have clear\n sailing all the way to Callisto.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"But\u2014but if there should be more than one, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Don't be ridiculous, my boy. Why should there be?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Well, for one thing,\" wrangled our pint-sized cook, \"because rich\n ekalastron deposits were recently discovered on Vesta. For another,\n because Vesta's orbit is now going into aphelion stage, which will\n favor a concentration of raiders.\"\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper choked, spluttered, and disgorged a bite of half-masticated\n pancake.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Eka\u2014Great balls of fire! Are you sure?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Of course, I'm sure. I told you days ago that I was born and raised in\n the Belt, Captain.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"I know. But why didn't you tell me about Vesta before? I mean about\n the ekalastron deposits?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Why\u2014why, because\u2014\" said Slops. \"Because\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Don't give me lady-logic, you dope!\" roared the Old Man, an enraged\n lion now, his breakfast completely forgotten. \"Give me a sensible\n answer! If you'd told me\n\n\n    that\n\n\n   instead of just yipping and yapping\n about how via Iris was a nicer route I'd have listened to you! As it\n is, we're blasting smack-dab into the face of danger. And us on the\n most vital mission of the whole ding-busted war!\"\n\n\n\n\n   He was out of his seat, bustling to the audio, buzzing Lieutenant\n Wainwright on the bridge.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Johnny\u2014that you? Listen, change traj quick! Set a new course through\n the Belt by way of Iris and the Bog, and hurry up, because\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\n   What reason he planned to give I do not know, for he never finished\n that sentence. At that moment the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   rattled like a Model AA\n spacesled in an ionic storm, rolled, quivered and slewed like a drunk\n on a freshly-waxed floor. The motion needed no explanation; it was\n unmistakeable to any spacer who has ever hopped the blue. Our ship had\n been gripped, and was now securely locked, in the clutch of a tractor\n beam!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   What happened next was everything at once. Officers Wainwright and\n Bramble were in the turret, and they were both good sailors. They knew\n their duties and how to perform them. An instant after the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   had\n been assaulted, the ship bucked and slithered again, this time with the\n repercussions of our own ordnance. Over the audio, which Sparks had\n hastily converted into an all-way, inter-ship communicating unit, came\n a jumble of voices. A call for Captain O'Hara to \"Come to the bridge,\n sir!\" ... the harsh query of Chief McMurtrie, \"Tractor beams on stern\n and prow, sir. Shall I attempt to break them?\" ... and a thunderous\n\n\n    groooom!\n\n\n   from the fore-gunnery port as a crew went into action ... a\n plaintive little shriek from somebody ... maybe from Slops himself....\n\n\n\n\n   Then on an ultra-wave carrier, drowning local noises beneath waves of\n sheer volume, came English words spoken with a foreign intonation. The\n voice of the Alliance commander.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Ahoy the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   ! Calling the captain of the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   !\"\n\n\n\n\n   O'Hara, his great fists knotted at his sides, called back, \"O'Hara of\n the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   answering. What do you want?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Stand by to admit a boarding party, Captain. It is futile to resist.\n You are surrounded by six armed craft, and your vessel is locked in\n our tensiles. Any further effort to make combat will bring about your\n immediate destruction!\"\n\n\n\n\n   From the bridge, topside, snarled Johnny Wainwright, \"The hell with\n 'em, Skipper! Let's fight it out!\" And elsewhere on the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   angry\n voices echoed the same defi. Never in my life had I felt such a\n heart-warming love for and pride in my companions as at that tense\n moment. But the Old Man shook his head, and his eyes were glistening.\n\n\n\n\n   \"It's no use,\" he moaned strickenly, more to himself than to me. \"I\n can't sacrifice brave men in a useless cause, Dugan. I've got to\u2014\" He\n faced the audio squarely. To the enemy commander he said, \"Very good,\n sir! In accordance with the Rules of War, I surrender into your hands!\"\n\n\n\n\n   The firing ceased, and a stillness like that of death blanketed the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   .\n\n\n\n\n   It was then that Andy Laney, who had lingered in the galley doorway\n like a frozen figuring, broke into babbling incredulous speech.\n\n\n\n\n   \"You\u2014you're giving up like this?\" he bleated. \"Is this all you're\n going to do?\"\n\n\n\n\n   The Old Man just looked at him, saying never a word, but that glance\n would have blistered the hide off a Mercurian steelback. I'm more\n impetuous. I turned on the little idiot vituperatively.\n\n\n\n\n   \"Shut up, you fool! Don't you realize there's not a thing we can do but\n surrender? Dead, we're of no earthly use to anyone. Alive, there is\n always a chance one of us may get away, bring help. We have a mission\n to fulfil, an important one. Corpses can't run errands.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"But\u2014but if they take us prisoners,\" he questioned fearfully, \"what\n will they do with us?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"A concentration camp somewhere. Perhaps on Vesta.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"And the\n\n\n    Leo\n\n\n   ?\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"Who knows? Maybe they'll send it to Jupiter with a prize crew in\n command.\"\n\n\n\n\n   \"That's what I thought. But they mustn't be allowed to do that. We're\n marked with the Federation tricolor!\"\n\n\n\n\n   A sharp retort trembled on the tip of my tongue, but I never uttered\n it. Indeed, I swallowed it as comprehension dawned. There came to me\n the beginnings of respect for little Andy Laney's wisdom. He had been\n right about the danger of the Vesta route, as we had learned to our\n cost; now he was right on this other score.\n\n\n\n\n   The skipper got it, too. His jaw dropped. He said, \"Heaven help us,\n it's the truth! To reach Jupiter you've got to pass Callisto. If the\n Callistans saw a Federation vessel, they'd send out an emissary to\n greet it. Our secret would be discovered, Callisto occupied by the\n enemy....\"\n\n\n\n\n   I think he would have turned, then, and given orders to continue the\n fight even though it meant suicide for all of us. But it was too late.\n Already our lock had opened to the attackers; down the metal ramp we\n now heard the crisp cadence of invading footsteps. The door swung open,\n and the Alliance commandant stood smiling triumphantly before us.\n\nQuestion and Possible Answers:\nWhat is the most likely meaning of the slang O.Q.?
