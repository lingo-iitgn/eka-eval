Simplifying both sides gives $5x + 3 = \\boxed{18}$.\nFinal answer: 18\nExample 2:\nsubject: Prealgebra\nquestion: Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal at the grocery store, but the scales at the store only show weight in kilograms. If one kilogram is $2.20$ pounds, how many kilograms of veal should Alice buy? (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest hundredth.)\nsolution: Since Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal, we multiply the quantity of $3$ pounds by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}}$ to obtain $3\\ \\text{lb} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}} \\approx \\boxed{1.36}\\ \\text{kg}$.\nFinal answer: 1.36\nExample 3:\nsubject: Number Theory\nquestion: One morning each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family?\nsolution: Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{x + y}{n}$. This leads to\n\\[\n3x(n - 4) = 2y(6 - n).\n\\]\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n 5\nExample 4:\nsubject: Precalculus\nquestion: Simplify\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x - 1}{\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x - 1}.\n\\]\nsolution: Let $p = \\sin x \\cos x$. We know that $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$. Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[\n\\sin^4 x + 2 \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x = 1.\n\\]\nHence,\n\\[\n\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x = 1 - 2p^2.\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\n(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)(\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x) = 1 - 2p^2.\n\\]\nExpanding, we get\n\\[\n\\sin^6 x + \\sin^2 x \\cos^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\sin^4 x + \\cos^6 x = 1 - 2p^2.\n\\]\nHence,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x &= 1 - 2p^2 - (\\sin^2 x \\cos^4 x + \\cos^2 x \\sin^4 x) \\\\\n&= 1 - 2p^2 - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) \\\\\n&= 1 - 3p^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x - 1}{\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x - 1} = \\frac{-2p^2}{-3p^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.\n\\]\n $\\frac{2}{3}$\nThink stepwise, refer to examples and provide the answer in similar manner.\nAnswer:\nsubject: Precalculus\nquestion: Simplify\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x - 1}{\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x - 1}.\n\\]\nsolution: Let $p = \\sin x \\cos x$.
