(You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest hundredth.)\nSolution: Since Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal, we multiply the quantity of $3$ pounds by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}}$ to obtain $3\\ \\text{lb} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}} \\approx \\boxed{1.36}\\ \\text{kg}$.\nFinal answer: 1.36\n\nSubject: Number Theory\nProblem: How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\nSolution:",
