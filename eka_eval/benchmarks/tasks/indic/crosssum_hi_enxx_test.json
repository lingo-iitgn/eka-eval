    "text": "I'd kind of given up on love, but then a couple of people convinced me I was too young to do that and said I should get back out on the market - they suggested online dating. It was pretty brutal and I was just about to give up when I got an enquiry from Philippe. It was just a brief, \"I like your profile, would like to meet,\" but I was intrigued. He was French and very nice looking, and I thought, \"OK, one last time, and that's it.\" We met at my martial arts school - he was also a martial artist - and then we went over to a local restaurant and had drinks and appetisers and sat for an hour and talked. I was fascinated and I guess he was too. He had cool stories and told me a lot about himself. That was kind of refreshing because usually it's the other way around, where the woman does all the talking, and I found that exhausting. On that first date I was pretty interested in him, but I couldn't really tell if he was feeling the same thing. But then he made this one flirtatious comment and I thought, \"Oh, OK, he is interested,\" and it went from there, we started dating fairly regularly. Philippe was a security analyst for a large company but he was laid off a year after we started dating. While he was looking for a new job I asked him to help me out at the school. When he was teaching for me we'd usually go out after work and then spend the night together. We had had the talk about being exclusive pretty early on in the relationship, so I was seeing him three or four times a week and the rest of the time I was busy with the school. I was happy, he was happy, it was good, and we were together for four-and-half years. In 2006 my daughter was getting married and we had a wonderful ceremony. Philippe was there - he took a video of the big family occasion - and we were all going for a family dinner afterwards. But then he called me from his cellphone and said, \"I can't go, I'm not feeling well.\" He didn't call from his home phone, which made me suspicious, and I was furious because the dinner was very important to me. I went by myself, but on my way home I thought I'd go by Philippe's and check on this poor sick man who couldn't make it to my family dinner. The door was locked, the house was dark, and his car wasn't there. I sat in the driveway and cried for a long time, and then I started to get angry. Because I'd been paying for his cellphone I was able to get into his voicemail. Two different women had left him messages and it was obvious from the voicemails that these were women that he had plans with. I waited for a good hour-and-a-half or more and then finally I saw him coming around the corner. When he saw my car he immediately sped away - he knew that something was up - so I followed him up and down the neighbourhood streets until he finally got on the highway. He was going 90 mph and I was right behind him. I thought, \"I can chase you all night, I got a full tank of gas.\" Eventually he pulled over. I yelled and screamed and accused him of cheating. He said, \"You shouldn't have hacked into my voicemail!\" and it went back and forth. He was so angry and started beating on the car and that scared me, so I decided that was it. Find out more Diane Reeve spoke to Jo Fidgen on Outlook on the BBC World Service You can listen again here We broke up on a Saturday. The following Monday I had a well-woman examination and when the results came back there were some anomalies in the cervical cells. They said it was human papilloma virus (HPV). I'd never had that before so I knew that he had given it to me. That shocked me and made me afraid - I had to have surgery to remove the abnormal cells and I didn't know if it would progress into cancer or not. I wondered if I should warn the other two women. I went back through the nine months' of Philippe's cellphone records that I had, trying to find them again. I would call numbers and whenever a woman answered, I would ask, \"Are you seeing Philippe Padieu?\" and if they said \"Yes,\" I would say, \"Well, I need to talk to you a little bit.\" I found nine other women who were also seeing him that way. Some of them were angry, some of them hung up on me, some of them were very interested, and some of them were appreciative - I got all kinds of different responses. A lady who had been seeing Philippe, who lived close to him, was so angry that she and I decided to meet with another couple of women. We had quite an interesting lunch comparing notes and we took a picture of ourselves making an obscene gesture and sent it to him. There was another woman who I contacted later on. We met at a little jazz bar. She'd been seeing Philippe three times a week for about a-year-and-a-half. She did not have an exclusive relationship with him, but she was waiting for that to happen, I think. I told her everything that had happened to me - how romantic things had been with us for years, how we were building a house together, how we were going to move in together but then broke up. I told her about the HPV and that I was continuing to have health problems. She listened very intently to what I had to say. I said, \"This is your decision and if you want to continue to see him then that's your business,\" and I thought that would be the last time we would talk. Three months later I got a call from the health department who said that I needed to come in for testing. I panicked because I had been having a lot of health problems in addition to the abnormal cervical smear. I had kept Philippe's phone in case somebody called and I could warn them too. I looked at it again after I was contacted by the health department and noticed that the last person to call it was the woman that I'd met at the jazz bar. I called her and I said, \"I just got a call from the health department, what can you tell me about this?\" She said four words that I will never forget: \"We need to talk.\" She had continued to see Philippe after we'd met but she'd then decided to break it off. She'd started to worry about sexually transmitted diseases and had gone to get tested. Her doctor had called her and told her that there was bad news, she was living with HIV. At that point I just knew that everything that I had gone through over the last six months - the health problems, not having any energy, things that I had attributed to getting a little bit older - all these puzzle pieces fitted together and I knew what I was facing. The next day I had an appointment with my gynaecologist and they took some blood. The following day they called me with the results. \"Diane, I'm sorry. It's positive.\" I dropped the phone and fell to my knees. I thought I was going to die. I had not followed HIV closely - I remembered when there was no cure, and I knew that there was medicine now, but I didn't really know how effective it was. And I knew that I was really, really sick. That was January 2007. When I went for further testing I found out that I had Aids. That means that your immune system is damaged to the point that you are very vulnerable to illness. Your body just won't fight back because the virus has damaged the cells which fight off infection. I had health insurance because I was self-employed; I had just changed policies about two months before I got the diagnosis. There was a disclaimer at the end of the policy which said, \"Please be aware that we do not cover HIV,\" which I had signed happily, because I knew I didn't have HIV. Except two months later I found out that I did. So I had insurance that did not pay for HIV and the medicine was about $2,000 (£1,500) a month and I couldn't afford it. Almost immediately after getting the results I went to counselling. I really needed some help to process things. I was terribly depressed, I was very fearful and I was homicidally angry. I decided to talk again to the woman I'd met at the jazz bar. We cried together, and we got angry together. When she had got her diagnosis she'd immediately called Philippe to let him know. He'd said: \"Hey, no big deal, everybody dies of something. Why don't you just go and live your life and leave me alone?\" It was a very odd reaction for someone who should have been shocked. We suspected that Philippe had given it to both of us and we thought there had to be something that could be done about it. We did some research and within weeks of my diagnosis we decided to file a police report. We wanted the police to stop him. We wanted them to find out if he actually did carry the virus and we wanted to find out if there was something that we could do to keep him from hurting other women. The police were very sympathetic and understanding but said that because there were only two of us we weren't going to be able to prove it. But if four or five women came forward, they said, then they might be able to get the district attorney to take a look. We went back through the cellphone records. The first person I called was the woman who lived in Philippe's neighbourhood that I'd met earlier. She got tested and was also diagnosed with HIV. She helped us by watching the house and writing down licence plate numbers of cars that were in Philippe's driveway overnight. We were kept pretty busy because he was with a different woman every night, it was incredible. I had a friend that could run the licence tags and get a name and address, and once we had that we would go and visit them. Altogether, we found 13 women who were diagnosed with HIV. I was devastated that this had been going on for so long. I'd been seeing Philippe since 2002, but some of the women I talked to pre-dated me and with a different car in the driveway every night countless women had been exposed. As the case progressed, the police department and the DA started to get involved. To try to prove that Philippe knew that he had been diagnosed the police set up what is called a pretext phone call. I sat at the police station and called him to try to get him to admit that he knew that he was living with HIV. It didn't go very well. He said, \"How the BLEEP did you get this number?\" and it went downhill from there. I said, \"Hey, I heard that you weren't feeling well and I was just calling to check on you,\" and he hung up on me. There was a lady at the health department who was helping us track down the women. I'd asked her, \"Have you ever seen this guy?\" but nothing rang a bell. Then I remembered that Philippe sometimes used an alias, the name Phil White, and she remembered that. The timeframe that she'd seen him was around the same time that I remembered sending him to the doctor because he felt like he had kidney stones. I thought, \"I wonder if that's when he got that diagnosis?\" It was 2005, about a year-and-a-half before we broke up. He had gone to the doctor and had some tests done. I had paid for that medical treatment so I pulled those cheques and took them to the district attorney - that was the first time I ever saw her smile. The cheques gave her \"probable cause\" to subpoena the medical records - which she did. Without that it would have been very difficult if not impossible to obtain them, due to privacy laws - and that's how we proved that he'd been diagnosed with HIV. Of the 13 women we found who were diagnosed with HIV only five agreed to testify in court, because of the stigma associated with the virus. We formed a support group and were able to meet at my house on a routine basis. We all got through it together. One motive for going through with it was that the state of Texas will pay for medical care that is needed as a result of a crime, and they were prosecuting Philippe for \"assault with a deadly weapon\". It was a long process, five to six months, of us tracking down women. Just about every day of the week we were on stake-out. It was exhausting - I still had Aids - but we were determined to stop him doing this to anybody else. The trial finally began in 2009, three years after Philippe and I had broken up and two years after my diagnosis. The district attorney had warned us that we would be raked over the coals, that anything that Philippe knew about us that was dirty laundry would be aired in public. Although I was prepared for it, I didn't know that it was going to be as brutal as it was - I was on the stand for about an hour, but I got through it. After the sentencing, we gathered all of our friends and families together and we celebrated because we knew he was not going to be able to hurt anybody else again. Philippe never took responsibility. He said that it was me that gave everybody HIV, which was obviously ludicrous - we found a woman in Michigan who he had transmitted HIV to in 1997. And we also did a DNA study that was very well controlled and scientifically proven that showed that the virus that was in each of us had a common source - and Philippe was the common source. I suspect that he had knowingly been transmitting HIV to women for years before I met him, and that the 2005 diagnosis was not his first. I have struggled with the forgiveness thing, but I'm at peace about it because, frankly, I took a lemon situation and made it into lemonade. But one of the things that I resent most about what Philippe did to me and the other women is that he destroyed my ability to trust and that makes relationships really hard. I'm working my way past it, but it's been a long struggle. I'm really lucky that I have a good relationship now with somebody who understands and loves me and accepts me. We first started seeing each other in 2008 and I disclosed to him on the second date. I started crying and he held me and said, \"It's OK, my brother died of Aids,\" and that was a very healing experience for me. The medicine has come so far that it's one pill a day now for most people - I've been on one pill a day for a long time. I have undetectable viral load which means the virus is not detectable in my blood. It's been shown that if you are a living with HIV and you have an undetectable viral load consistently over six months there is zero transmission risk - that was a game changer for all of us. I'm still in contact with a lot of the other women. I went to the Grand Canyon on vacation with one of them last year - the woman from the jazz bar. If I had not met her she would have never thought to get tested and if she had not given my name to the health department I would have never gotten tested. We seriously saved each other's lives.

    "text": "Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is one of seven men facing trial over the attacks in the Indian city, which left 165 people dead. Nine gunmen were also killed. The attacks in Mumbai damaged peace efforts between India and Pakistan. The bailing of Mr Lakhvi came a day after Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif vowed to end terrorism after the Taliban killed 141 people at a school in Peshawar. Correspondents say the move will be an embarrassment for the Pakistani authorities who are under pressure to bring suspects in the case to justice. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and his co-accused were arrested in 2008 and had filed bail applications on 10 December. It remains unclear on what grounds the court ordered Mr Lakhvi's bail. The attacks in Mumbai were blamed on the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Mr Lakhvi was accused of heading the group. Another man, Zarar Shah, has been accused of working with him, and was arrested in Pakistani-administered Kashmir in December 2008, but his name does not appear alongside those being tried with Mr Lakhvi. Nine other men have been also charged in absentia in relation to the attacks. Mr Lakhvi was directed to pay surety bonds worth 1m rupees ($15,800; £10,100) before being released, his lawyer told Reuters. The lawyer, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, told the PTI news agency that bail had been granted because the \"evidence against Lakhvi was deficient\". Prosecutors are considering whether to challenge the ruling. India, which provided intelligence intercepts which it said proved Laskhar-e Taiba's involvement in the attack, was swift to criticise Mr Lakhvi's release. Home Minister Rajnath Singh described the granting of bail as \"very unfortunate\". He said: \"I believe it should not have happened... [The] Pakistan government must appeal against the order at the earliest.\" Correspondents say the charges brought against Mr Lakhvi and other suspects held in Pakistan were mainly based on a confession given by the only gunman captured alive after the attacks. Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab was executed in 2012.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Nothing short of a repeal of three market-friendly farm laws - designed to loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - will make the farmers retreat from protest sites ringing the capital, Delhi. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, responding to a bunch of petitions, put the laws on hold. The uncertainty lingers. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government fail to anticipate the blowback to the laws and misread the public mood in the affected states of Punjab and Haryana? Were they lulled into complacency because a Punjab-based ally initially supported the laws? (The Akali Dal later reversed its stand and quit the government.) Did the government believe that the laws would not lead to any significant erosion of popular support? Mr Modi has built a reputation for tough talking and playing hardball with his critics and his party is widely believed to have its ears to the ground. Protests had been brewing in Punjab even before the laws were ratified in the parliament in the middle of the pandemic last September. Angry farmers had squatted on railway tracks in protest. In late September, the regional Akali Dal had walked out. So why was Mr Modi caught on the wrong foot by what has now grown into arguably the world's biggest protest? One reason, many believe, is that Mr Modi has not faced a mass movement against his regime. A protest by the influential Patel community in Gujarat in 2015 demanding quotas in government jobs lingered on for four years before a resolution. A months-long protest led mostly by Muslim women in a Delhi neighbourhood against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was cleared last March amid measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. But none were as large and intense as the ongoing protests, and did not challenge the government in the way the defiant farmers have. \"I don't think Mr Modi misread the situation because he had no knowledge about the protests in Punjab. I think the overconfidence arose from his inexperience in dealing with mass protests,\" says Prof Parminder Singh, a civil rights activist. Second, the current protests are significantly different from similar agitations in India's history. In colonial India, peasant revolts against exploitative rulers often turned violent. Since Independence in 1947, farmers have staged demonstrations against falling crop prices, indebtedness and farm distress. But none have seen the staggering levels of cohesion and mobilisation - involving some 40 farmers' unions, more than half a million protesters, and large swathes of civil society - as the ongoing agitation. The protests have originated in Punjab, the relatively prosperous farming heartland of India. Along with its neighbour Haryana, the two states have benefited most from India's farm policies. These farmers are now frustrated over stagnant and falling farm incomes and fear that entry of private businesses will hurt their future. The protests have now widened to coalesce around a range of anxieties over farming in India - shrinking plots of land, diminished produce, volatility in crop prices, and centralisation of lawmaking in a country where farming matters are mainly entrusted with the states. \"The protest is more than an arena of grievances,\" Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political science at Ashoka University, told me. \"It's also about a lack of trust in the government and an assertive articulation of federalism.\" At the protest sites, the mood is one of unbending resistance against the government. \"People here are calling it a revolution for our rights,\" Surmeet Mavi, one of the editors of Trolley Times, a daily newsletter published from the protest site, told me. \"It's a feeling of fearlessly taking on the powerful government.\" For decades, the dominant stereotype of the Indian farmer has been one of a semi-literate, struggling man, who tirelessly ploughs the land. The reality is that India's 150-odd million farmers are of different kinds - the big and small; the landed and the landless. So when it was reported that the protesters were having pizzas, there was some unkind social media chatter about whether these people really worked on the farms. It laid bare, again, how little urban Indians know about their rural brethren. What Mr Modi's government and many people have possibly failed to understand is that many of the protesting farmers have deep linkages with urbanity. Many of them have children in the army and police, speak English, use social media and have both travelled and have relatives abroad. The protest sites are well organised with clinics, ambulances, kitchens, facilities, libraries, and even its own newspaper. Like most urban protests, there's the risk of the media-fuelled spectacle overtaking the underlying complexities of the agitation. \"This farmer movement speaks the language of middle-class India. They are saying they are patriotic, and fighting for the rights they hold dear,\" says historian Mahesh Rangarajan. This is also not a conventional protest against farm distress or drought, which most governments have been successful at managing. This agitation is ironically a consequence of Punjab's success in farming - the state is the biggest beneficiary of government-guaranteed prices of wheat and rice, and elaborate state-supported marketing structures. These have now become a millstone around Punjab's neck - a glut of two crops has led to overflowing stocks, stagnating incomes and depleting groundwater. \"The challenge is that Punjab has been unable to transition from a largely well-to-do farming society to one where there is environmentally sustainable agriculture and industrialisation,\" says Prof Mehta. More than 85% of India's farmers are small and marginal, and they work on some 47% of the total farming land. Both the government and farmers agree that farming needs reform. But they cannot agree on specifics. \"There are solutions. But the farmers don't trust the government,\" says Prof Mehta. And therein lies the real problem.",

    "text": "\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she told a UN climate summit in New York. About 60 world leaders are taking part in the one-day meeting organised by UN Secretary General António Guterres. He earlier said countries could only speak at the summit if they came with action plans to cut carbon emissions. US President Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, had not been expected at the meeting - but he was briefly spotted in the audience. Brazil and Saudi Arabia are among the countries staying away. What did Greta Thunberg say? In an emotional speech, she said: \"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" the 16-year-old said. And she urged world leaders to act urgently, saying: \"We will be watching you.\" What did world leaders say? Mr Guterres, who organised the meeting, said the world was \"in a deep climate hole\" and that urgent action was needed. \"Time is running out, but it's not too late,\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would double to €4bn (£3.5bn; $4.4bn) it financial commitment to fight global warming. French President Emmanuel Macron said international organisations had pledged to release $500m in additional aid to protect tropical forests. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said things \"are starting to turn around\" in the country. \"Our gross emissions peaked in 2006, over 80% of our electricity already comes from renewable hydro and wind, and we have begun an ambitious agenda. \"We have introduced in parliament the zero carbon bill, the purpose of which is to ensure New Zealand lives within the threshold of 1.5C of global warming necessary to avoid catastrophic weather events for our Pacific neighbours.\" Scientists' warning The summit comes days after several million people took part in a global climate strike led by youth activists. Ahead of the meeting, scientists warned the signs and impacts of global warming were speeding up. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2019 had grown by 20% compared with the previous five years. \"We should listen to the loud cry coming from the schoolchildren,\" said Professor Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and professor of meteorology at the University of Reading. \"There is an emergency - one for action in both rapidly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions towards zero and adapting to the inevitable changes in climate,\" he said. Scientists plead with politicians By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst As the dangers of climate heating become ever more apparent, so does the absence of collective will to tackle the issue. In 2015 in Paris, all the world's leaders sounded their determination to curb the emissions that were heating the climate. The summit will see a host of initiatives from businesses and small- and medium-sized nations. But President Trump is encouraging fossil fuel use in every way he can. And China - in spite of its trend-setting commitment to solar and wind power - is still building new coal-fired power stations. Even the UK, a global leader in climate policy-making, is veering away from its own medium-term targets to cut emissions. The government is still aiming to expand Heathrow airport and increase the road network in a way that will increase emissions in those sectors. Politicians appear to believe climate change can be challenged with a version of economic business as usual. Their scientists are telling them with increasing desperation that we humans are facing an unprecedented threat in need of an unprecedented response. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",

    "text": "A regional court found them guilty of multiple manslaughter. Prosecutors said the defendants gave a falsely reassuring statement before the quake, while the defence maintained there was no way to predict major quakes. The 6.3 magnitude quake devastated the city and killed 309 people. Many smaller tremors had rattled the area in the months before the quake that destroyed much of the historic centre. It took Judge Marco Billi slightly more than four hours to reach the verdict in the trial, which had begun in September 2011. Lawyers have said that they will appeal against the sentence. As convictions are not definitive until after at least one level of appeal in Italy, it is unlikely any of the defendants will immediately face prison. 'Alarming' case The seven - all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks - were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of 6 April 2009 quake, Italian media report. In addition to their sentences, all have been barred from ever holding public office again, La Repubblica reports. In the closing statement, the prosecution quoted one of its witnesses, whose father died in the earthquake. It described how Guido Fioravanti had called his mother at about 11:00 on the night of the earthquake - straight after the first tremor. \"I remember the fear in her voice. On other occasions they would have fled but that night, with my father, they repeated to themselves what the risk commission had said. And they stayed.\" 'Hasty sentence' The judge also ordered the defendants to pay court costs and damages. Reacting to the verdict against him, Bernardo De Bernardinis said: \"I believe myself to be innocent before God and men.\" \"My life from tomorrow will change,\" the former vice-president of the Civil Protection Agency's technical department said, according to La Repubblica. \"But, if I am judged by all stages of the judicial process to be guilty, I will accept my responsibility.\" Another, Enzo Boschi, described himself as \"dejected\" and \"desperate\" after the verdict was read. \"I thought I would have been acquitted. I still don't understand what I was convicted of.\" One of the lawyers for the defence, Marcello Petrelli, described the sentences as \"hasty\" and \"incomprehensible\". 'Inherently unpredictable' The case has alarmed many in the scientific community, who feel science itself has been put on trial. Some scientists have warned that the case might set a damaging precedent, deterring experts from sharing their knowledge with the public for fear of being targeted in lawsuits, the BBC's Alan Johnston in Rome reports. Among those convicted were some of Italy's most prominent and internationally respected seismologists and geological experts. Earlier, more than 5,000 scientists signed an open letter to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in support of the group in the dock. After the verdict was announced, David Rothery, of the UK's Open University, said earthquakes were \"inherently unpredictable\". \"The best estimate at the time was that the low-level seismicity was not likely to herald a bigger quake, but there are no certainties in this game,\" he said. Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics at the UK's Royal Berkshire Hospital said that the sentence was surprising and could set a worrying precedent. \"If the scientific community is to be penalised for making predictions that turn out to be incorrect, or for not accurately predicting an event that subsequently occurs, then scientific endeavour will be restricted to certainties only and the benefits that are associated with findings from medicine to physics will be stalled.\"",

How were the 100 Women chosen? The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who led change - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen.

    "text": "A recent episode of the spy thriller showed the main character, played by Ms Chopra, thwarting a plot hatched by Hindus ahead of a summit on Kashmir. Many Indian fans were outraged by the show's story and attacked her online. Ms Chopra declared herself a \"proud Indian\" in a tweet and \"extremely saddened\" by any hurt caused by the show. The episode, The Blood of Romeo, aired on 1 June and showed the main character, Alex Parrish, stopping an attempted terror attack. Though ostensibly planned by Pakistanis ahead of a summit about Kashmir, the disputed territory in the Himalayas claimed by India and Pakistan, Ms Chopra's character discovers it is in fact Hindu nationalists trying to frame the Pakistanis. Nuclear-armed Pakistan and India have fought two wars over the Kashmir region since partition in 1947. There was fury online after the episode aired, with some declaring Ms Chopra \"an insult to India\" and the episode an attack on Hindus. In a statement, ABC apologised for stepping into \"a complex political issue\" and defended Ms Chopra from the attacks online, clarifying she did not write, direct or cast the show, and nor does she have any input over plots. Ms Chopra has faced anger from fans before. She drew ire after she wore a dress that showed her legs in a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.

    "text": "By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Pupils will not be allowed to bring mobiles to school without written parental consent. The authorities say they want to protect young people's eyesight, improve their concentration and prevent internet addiction. Schools are being encouraged to find other ways for parents to communicate with children during the school day. According to one of the country's newspapers, China Daily, there has been heated debate among parents over the whether the ruling is practical. The vast majority of children and teenagers in China access the internet via their own smartphones - 74% of under-18s, according to the government-affiliated China Internet Network Information Centre. But the authorities are concerned about how internet use is affecting the health of the nation's youth. There have been rising levels of nearsightedness among children in China and in 2018, the authorities announced plans to regulate the gaming industry which was partially blamed for the problem. They also cited concerns that gaming addiction was damaging mental health. The following year a curfew was imposed on under-18s, who were restricted to 90 minutes of gaming on weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays. French ban Many schools in China already restrict the use of mobile phones on their premises. In some extreme cases, phones have been smashed in front of students who have broken the rules. The topic of a ban has become a major news item in China and on social media, with thousands discussing it on social media site Weibo. Some 27,000 people voted in an online Sina News poll, with most saying there was no need for the new rules because of the widespread ban during school hours. Some pointed out that children may continue to over-use their phones when not in school. A plan to stop schools setting homework tasks via phone has also been criticised. One teacher told state broadcaster CCTV that \"not allowing phones to contact someone, or to arrange homework, that will take some getting used to. They all get so much homework, so that's been convenient.\" French lawmakers voted in 2018 to ban the use of phones in primary and middle schools, ruling that children under 15 have to keep their mobile phones out of sight while on school premises. A survey conducted in the UK by price comparison site uSwitch last year suggested that just under half of UK parents thought their child's school should ban mobile phones. The use of phones in the UK is generally left up to individual schools. One head teacher, from Anglesey in Wales, told the BBC that teachers could find themselves spending too much time challenging children for using phones, which took time away from actually teaching them.",

    "text": "The 47-year-old founder of Republic TV was detained last week and remanded to custody for 14 days. He is being investigated for his alleged role in the death of an architect who designed his studio. Mr Goswami and Republic TV network deny allegations he owed money to Anvay Naik, who took his life in 2018. The case is being closely followed as Mr Goswami is a polarising figure whose contentious broadcasts have earned him loyal viewers as well as critics. His arrest, too, has divided opinion, with many alleging it was politically motivated. A video aired on Republic TV on Sunday showed Mr Goswami shouting from inside a police van. He alleged that a prison official had attacked him the previous evening, his life was in danger and that he was not allowed to speak to his lawyer. This happened while he was being transferred to a jail from a makeshift Covid quarantine centre where he had tested negative for the virus. After Mr Naik killed himself, his wife accused Mr Goswami of not paying his fee. She said her husband had left a suicide note in which he blamed Mr Goswami for his death. She has been campaigning on social media for the case to be investigated thoroughly. Maharashtra state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh recently ordered a special team to look into the case. A police team arrested Mr Goswami from his home in Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, on 4 November. Images showed scuffles taking place between Mr Goswami and the police. Republic TV has accused the police of \"manhandling\" Mr Goswami's family members. But the police then accused Mr Goswami of misbehaving with them - they registered a police complaint against him for allegedly assaulting a female police officer. Mr Goswami is known for his aggressive style of anchoring and questioning. Critics also say that he comes across as sympathetic to right-wing politics in the country. In recent months, he has been particularly critical of Mumbai police over their handling of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. He often accused Mumbai police of being lenient in their investigation into the star's death. He has recently also been critical of the Maharashtra government, which is run by a coalition headed by the Shiv Sena party - a former ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. Republic TV says that Mr Goswami has been targeted over his journalism. Mr Deshmukh said \"nobody is above the law\". The Editors Guild of India urged the authorities to \"ensure that Goswami is treated fairly and state power is not used against critical reporting by the media\". A host of senior leaders and federal ministers belonging to the BJP have also criticised his arrest, saying it was \"an attack on the media's freedom of expression\". But the main opposition Congress party, which is a coalition partner of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, has accused the BJP of \"selective outrage\". The party said BJP ministers do not speak out when journalists are harassed and arrested by states where it's in power.",

    "text": "In a statement, he said the two worst affected provinces, Leyte and Samar, had suffered massive destruction and loss of life. Thousands of survivors are still desperately waiting for the aid effort to reach them. At least 10,000 people are feared to have been killed. Tacloban is one of the worst affected cities. The BBC's Jon Donnison, who is there, says there does not yet seem to be an effective operation to get help to those in need. This is expected to change over the next few days, he says. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced after the high winds and floodwaters destroyed their homes. Damage to roads and airports has delayed the delivery of aid. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the UN would launch a large-scale humanitarian plan on Tuesday. He called for UN member states to show solidarity with the people of the Philippines. \"We have all seen the heartbreaking images of the impact of this huge storm,\" he said. One of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall, Haiyan - named \"Yolanda\" by Philippine authorities - struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Struggle More than nine million people have been affected in the Philippines. Many are now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. A picture is slowly emerging of the full damage wrought by the storm: A huge international relief effort is under way, but rescue workers have struggled to reach areas cut off since the storm. However, reports from Tacloban say soldiers have been distributing food and water to some residents and the US military has sent marines to the city. The head of the Philippine Red Cross, Richard Gordon, described the situation as \"absolute bedlam\". \"It's only now that they were able to get in and we're beginning just to bring in the necessary food items... as well as water and other things that they need,\" he told the BBC. Jane Cocking, the humanitarian director for Oxfam, said her colleagues witnessed \"complete devastation\". A Philippine military spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday that 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected. The UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, was is her way to the Philippines. A priority of the UN's response teams once on the ground would be the burial of bodies to meet concerns about public health, UN humanitarian official John Ging said. \"We are certainly expecting the worst,\" he added. \"As we get more and more access we find the tragedy of more and more people killed in this typhoon.\" 'Unprecedented' storm Some are questioning what more authorities could have done to prepare for this, just the latest in a string of disasters to hit the nation of more than 7,000 islands. Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the typhoon arrived, but many evacuation centres - schools, churches and government buildings - proved unable to withstand the winds and storm surges. Haiyan brought sustained winds of 235km/h (147mph), with gusts of 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves as high as 15m (45ft). In some places, as much as 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain fell. Officials said looting was widespread and order was proving difficult to enforce. Correspondents say many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. In some areas, the dead are being buried in mass graves. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu, with relief efforts focusing on Tacloban. Other countries have also pledged millions of dollars in assistance. Britain is earmarking £10m ($15); Australia has approved $9m in humanitarian aid to the Philippines; while New Zealand has pledged over $1m. Typhoon Haiyan later made landfall in Vietnam, near the tourist destination of Ha Long Bay, with sustained winds of up to 140 km/h (85mph). Despite losing much of its strength, the storm still felled trees and damaged buildings, with reports of some casualties. Some 600,000 people were evacuated in northern provinces of the country.",

The information was released after a freedom of information request by the Associated Press. The majority of the bodies are male, but the remains of some 20 women were also found. The unmarked graves were discovered during the huge investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students. The number of mass graves found from October to May could be higher because the information given to AP only covers instances in which specialists became involved. The students, from a teachers' college in Guerrero, had travelled to Iguala and, as part of a protest, commandeered a number of buses. The government says the 43 were intercepted by police and handed to members of a drugs gang who killed them and incinerated their bodies. Gang members confessed to killing the students and burning their bodies after they were mistakenly told they belonged to a rival gang. The badly burnt remains of one student have been found at a rubbish dump, but many families of the remaining 42 refuse to believe the students are dead. Correspondents say the case has highlighted the huge number of people who have gone missing in Mexican states where drug violence is widespread.",

    "text": "A number of incidents where people have experienced hostility because of the colour of their skin and their ethnic background have been shared online. It is unclear whether the referendum result has brought about a rise in hostility, or if it is just a case of the sentiment being highlighted more since Friday. However the MP for Birmingham Yardley, Jess Phillips, believes there is a legitimate cause for concern. She has tweeted that she will ask a parliamentary question on the issue. On Twitter the hashtag #postrefracism had been used 21,000 times by Monday morning. It was started by a group of the same name, which is calling for people to share their experiences. 'Pack your bags' Former Conservative parliamentary candidate Shazia Awan worked for the Stronger In campaign in Wales. She says she noticed a number of incidents of anti-foreign sentiment. \"When the Leave campaign focussed on the issue of immigration a few weeks before the result, I could feel the difference in how people were acting,\" she said. \"While I was campaigning, I was speaking to a black woman. A white man walked past and called her the N word.\" After the referendum result, Shazia experienced a backlash herself when she tweeted her reaction to the outcome of the vote. \"After I came from the count on Friday morning I posted a tweet about David Cameron being the least worst thing about the Conservative party. \"Then I got a reply saying I should pack my bags and go home - I was born in Caerphilly in Wales. \"I don't like what this means for all of us.\" Ms Awan thinks the government should do more to address the negative consequences of the referendum result. \"I am so upset for this country because something quite dangerous has been unleashed. \"The result has legitimised people's race hatred. Although they don't make up the majority, they are an intolerant loud minority who are fundamentally wounding a whole community. \"There is a failure in government to acknowledge what is going on, and it says a lot about the state of UK politics at the moment. \"The prime minister pushed forward a community cohesion agenda, but this has gone. \"What is happening to our country? We will look back at this time as a dark time in the UK. I feel we have gone tumbling backwards in history. \"I saw this during the London mayoral campaign when individuals leading the Brexit campaign were calling Sadiq Khan too dangerous to be mayor - I would say Boris Johnson is too dangerous to lead the Conservative party and to become prime minister as he is far more interested in his own career than the welfare of this country.\" The news correspondent Ciaran Jenkins posted anecdotes that he had witnessed: \"Retired builder in Barnsley says he voted to 'send them foreigners home.' Tough time to be a migrant,\" he tweeted. Worrying signs When Sarah Childs saw stories of abuse appearing on her Twitter timeline, she wanted to highlight the issue. \"I was expecting this to happen as there was a lot of nastiness from both sides of the EU referendum campaign,\" said Sarah. \"I saw a theme running through my Twitter feed and thought I should gather the stories in a collection. \"I'm a white British person and I started the Facebook group with friends who are of Indian and Pakistani descent. \" Sarah and her friends created the page on Sunday morning and have already amassed over 5,000 members. \"We wanted to create a space for people who felt unsafe,\" explains Sarah. \"The idea was to show that this referendum has kicked up this problem and we need to be aware of this and do something about it, as well as dealing with other issues such as the economy. \"I spoke to people who voted leave about what is happening and many said we should just move on. \"I think it's easier for people to dismiss isolated incidents of abuse, but harder to ignore if the experiences are put together in one place. \"The abuse is hurting people and it is something we need to address.\"",

    "text": "The chatter, involving top leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, represented one of the most serious plots since the 9/11 attacks, the New York Times says. The US earlier said the closures in North Africa and the Middle East were \"out of an abundance of caution\". Some 20 US embassies and consulates were shut on Sunday. A state department global travel alert, issued last week, is also in force until the end of August. US diplomatic posts in Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa and Tripoli will remain closed until Saturday. Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen and the UK Foreign Office is advising against all travel to the country. Both the White House and the US state department said the threat came from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but refused to divulge further details, reports the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, in Washington. But according to the New York Times, the US intercepted communications between Zawahiri and the group's head in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi. The paper said that no targets had been singled out in the discussions, but that a possible attack appeared to be imminent. A US official told the Associated Press news agency that Zawahiri's message had been picked up several weeks ago and appeared initially targeted at Yemen. US lawmakers have said it was a huge plot in the final stages, but have offered no specifics. On Monday, a top member of the House intelligence committee Dutch Ruppersberger told CNN the warnings were not designed to frighten Americans, though he said a planned attack could be \"anywhere\". \"Americans should live their lives... we just want them to be aware,\" Representative Ruppersberger said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said he could not be \"specific\" about the threats. He said: \"Our current information suggests that al-Qaeda and affiliated organisations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond. And our information suggests that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August.\" Meanwhile, officials in Yemen have released the names of 25 al-Qaeda suspects, saying they had been planning attacks targeting \"foreign offices and organisations and Yemeni installations\" in the capital of Sanaa and other cities across the country. There was also increased security at government buildings and checkpoints in Yemen on Monday. AQAP, the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda, has also been blamed for the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit and explosives-laden parcels that were intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights. Seven suspected al-Qaeda militants were killed in two US drone air strikes in southern Yemen in June, officials say.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Hardik Patel has a mild scowl and a slight stoop. A commerce graduate and son of a businessman, he is utterly middle-class. At 24, he is not even old enough to stand for election under India's rules. Yet, in less than two years, Mr Patel has become, in the words of one observer, Mr Modi's \"tormentor-in-chief\". He is the face of massive caste protests which have rocked the prime minister's home state - which goes to polls on Saturday - and is leading a movement demanding that the Patels - or the Patidar caste - be given better access to jobs and education through the quota system. 'Patels feel left behind' Some 14% of people in Gujarat are Patels, a socially privileged, influential farming community which has traditionally voted for Mr Modi's BJP, that has ruled Gujarat for more than two decades. In the past the community has fought violently against affirmative action, believing that merit should the sole determinant for college seats and government jobs. But things have changed. India is in the throes of massive churn and tilling the land is increasingly being seen as a back-breaking, unprofitable profession, that is less prestigious than others. A number of landowning castes - Jats in Haryana and Marathas in Maharashtra, for example - are in ferment because they feel they lack the means to educate themselves and get professional jobs. Quality state-run professional colleges are too few, and their mushrooming private counterparts too expensive for most people. Declining farm incomes are pushing community members into cities, where the lack of jobs has made competition for them intense. Some 48,000 small and medium factories, many owned by the Patels, have shut in Gujarat in the face of competition from cheaper Chinese imports. Anxious about their future, they have taken to the streets to demand affirmative action, even though there is little scope to extend quotas. \"The Patels feel left behind,\" says lawyer Anand Yagnik. He says most of them support quotas. In 2012, the BJP won 115 of Gujarat's 182 seats under Mr Modi's leadership. Two years later, he stormed to power in Delhi with a general landslide, and Gujarat has since been ruled by politicians who lack his stature. So the BJP no longer looks invincible in the state. Under fire from Mr Patel's community, which is threatening to desert it in droves and damage its prospects for a sixth outright win, Mr Modi's party is suddenly on the back foot. The Patels can influence the ballot in some 70 seats, where they are considerable in number. The BJP appears to have bungled in its efforts to placate the community with its strong arm tactics. Twelve community members died after police fired on Patel demonstrators two years ago. Mr Patel himself was charged with sedition and jailed for nine months, and then, according to his bail conditions, told to remain out of the state for six months. Imprisonment and exile made him a hero in Patel eyes. In the small town of Talala, supporters call him a messiah and gift him framed pictures of Asiatic lions whose last abode is the nearby Gir forest. \"He's the real lion among us,\" one of them told me. \"The BJP is facing its toughest election since 2002. The threat from Hardik Patel is serious. He's the biggest story of the Gujarat elections,\" says Uday Mahurkar, a senior journalist and author of a book on Mr Modi's government. So when Mr Patel arrives three hours late in a silver SUV at the crossroads, his supporters surge forward to get a glimpse of him. Many are young men on motorbikes, with smartphones and sunglasses, and wear tee-shirts emblazoned with pictures of their leader. If they have jobs, they tend to be low-paid. Some have no job at all. Youth uprising First-time voter Bhavadib Maradia, 19, says he doubts he'll get a job in the private sector after he graduates, and to qualify for a government job he will need a quota. Kirti Panara, a 42-year-old small plastic goods trader, says he wants his daughter to become an engineer or doctor and escape small-town drudgery. The only sugar factory in the area has been shut for years, and telecoms adverts around the town square promising a \"digital life\" somehow ring hollow for the locals. Mr Patel waves out of the car sunroof, and then comes out to meet his supporters. Women smear vermillion on his forehead, offer him sweets and pose for selfies. It's a rag-tag army of fans without a party, but the outpouring of support is remarkably spontaneous. \"Brother Hardik, march ahead, we are with you,\" they shout out in unison. After urging supporters to vote the BJP out, Mr Patel's untidy motorcade weaves its way through the throngs lining the narrow roads. At a packed public meeting in nearby school grounds, Mr Patel, in his trademark checked shirt and denim, is blunt about taking on Mr Modi and his BJP: he talks about farming in distress, the lack of jobs and the urban-rural divide. When he seeks affirmation from the young audience, a sea of hands clutching mobile phones goes up in the air. Last month, Mr Patel announced a tie-up with the Congress party, which last won an election in the state in 1985, but has consistently picked up more than 30% of the popular vote in state elections. Led by a resurgent Rahul Gandhi, the Congress has also stitched up an alliance with two other newer, electorally untested leaders - Alpesh Thakor, a 40-year-old leader of a grouping called the OBCs (Other Backward Classes) which fall between the traditional upper castes and the lowest; and a 36-year-old Dalit (formerly untouchable) leader, Jignesh Mevani, who is running as an independent. They are all united in their resolve to defeat the BJP. Urban vote It's a rainbow alliance of disparate bedfellows: affirmative action beneficiaries (OBCs and Dalits) and aspirants (Patels) who have had an adversarial relationship in the past. The BJP hopes that the alliance votes will not easily transfer to the Congress and believes that Mr Modi's undisputable charisma - he held more than two dozen public meetings in the run-up to the election - will see the party through when results are declared on 18 December. Gujarat is a highly urbanised state, and the BJP enjoys the overwhelming support of the urban middle class. Five years ago, the party won 71 of the 84 seats in big cities and smaller towns. This time, the 98 rural seats could cause a headache to the party. Many villagers say they are not happy with last year's controversial currency ban which squeezed incomes and cut crop prices. \"Development is about the development of youth and farmers, of villages. It should not be lopsided in favour of cities,\" Mr Patel told me. The BJP is also coping with an inevitable anti-incumbency factor after ruling uninterruptedly for more than 20 years. Whether it will be able to triumph over caste and identity with its talk about development and muscular Hindu nationalism remains to be seen. When it comes to funds and mobilising voters, the BJP has a clear advantage. But it's not having an easy time - one leading opinion poll found a narrowing gap between the BJP and Congress that could even lead to a close finish. However urban votes could still tilt the vote in favour of the BJP. \"The evidence so far seems to suggest that while the going may be tough for the BJP, the party will still scrape through and form the next government in Gujarat,\" says Sanjay Kumar, a pollster who has conducted three rounds of polling in the state. Mr Patel believes the time to defeat the BJP is now. \"If things don't change this time, it will mean that the people of Gujarat are powerless against the BJP,\" he says.",

In opting to refer to the model as \"ten\" rather than \"x\", the firm has also thrown its naming convention into a bit of confusion - will there ever be an iPhone 9 - or indeed IX? Of course, that's a problem for another day. And the internet has had plenty else to chew over in the meantime... Cnet The two biggest questions for me focus on the iPhone X's most daring design change, ditching the home button. Will it actually make the phone more convenient to use? And will using your face to unlock the phone benefit you, or is it just a workaround? The Verge The iPhone X may be the most powerful iPhone ever, but compared to almost any other Android flagships, it's hard to pick out a category where it leads the pack - at least on paper when comparing raw specifications. But if Apple has shown one thing time and again with every iPhone generation, it's that optimisation of hardware and software matter just as much - if not more. Wall Street Journal The iPhone X's new design - a 5.8in, edge-to-edge display -has raised hopes that it can reverse Apple's fortunes in China, where sales have fallen six straight quarters. Chinese consumers are more influenced by a phone's appearance than consumers in other markets, and Apple had kept the same appearance for three years. Bloomberg A $1,000 iPhone could add as much as 6% to Apple's 2018 earnings per share... but that depends on the iPhone X being a hit, and there's more competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which timed the introduction of their new phones around Apple's launch to attract customers who may be deterred by the iPhone X's price. Slashgear Apple has crafted a stunning new flagship. In a time when existing iPhones were starting to look a little - dare I say - pedestrian in comparison to what Samsung, LG, and others were doing in hardware, the iPhone X has accelerated through and can spar with the best of them. Engadget What did bother me a little more than expected were the bezels that run around the screen... Given that Apple's competition has done an incredible job trimming the cruft from around their displays, I can't help but feel that the iPhone X's design doesn't have the same kind of impact as, say, the Essential or Samsung's recent Galaxys. Wired The very notion of using your face as the key to your digital secrets presents some fundamental problems... It's very hard to hide your face from someone who wants to coerce you to unlock your phone, like a mugger, a customs agent, or a policeman who has just arrested you. In some cases, criminal suspects in the US can invoke the Fifth Amendment protections from self-incrimination to refuse to give up their phone's passcode. That same protection doesn't apply to your face. Financial Times All the focus today was on the innovations in the X.But it all made the new 8 look like a rather boring, \"plain old\" iPhone - and the price for that has just gone up $50 as well. Techcrunch The X is the best iPhone, no questions, and it's quickly jumped to the top of the best phones, period. Yeah, it's going to cost you, but you already knew that. Twitter: \"I gaze into the iPhone and the iPhone gazes back at me\" - Nietzsche. @ericasadun I'm not sure how the iPhone X face recognition will distinguish between me with make-up and without make-up. Because the difference is real. @kandeejohnson So if you were sleeping and your girl picks the iPhone X and puts it in your face, it just unlocks it yeah? Lol. Thanks Apple. But no, thanks. @DrOlufunmilayo I think the leaks spoiled the iPhone X keynote, but Apple also didn't do enough to show why augmented reality matters. @tomwarren The choice is simple: The iPhone X or 363 coffees. @joshtgoossen Releasing the iPhoneX and 8 at the same time is strange, surely those who get the 8 will feel they've not got the latest iPhone. @Mr_Iconic The iPhone X is over a thousand dollars but I get to make myself into a poop emoji, so ya, it's worth it. @donaldcookie Facebook iPhone X has facial recognition. It'll look at your face and tell you that you can't afford it. - Abhimanyu Singh Face ID seems like an over-engineered fix that they were forced to include because they couldn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the screen - Nick Farina How on earth can they justify the same price in $s as in £s... utterly shameful! I won't be buying on that basis alone. - Darren Taylor They made the 8 almost identical to the 7 so people would have to spend the extra money for the X. And I'm sure I'll buy one even though I know what they did. - Patrick Michael Google has just been given a gift. Apple could have really done something that would have caused Android fans angst today. It did not. Instead, we're looking toward the Pixel 2 launch in October with renewed interest. - Robert Scoble Reddit Apple isn't the first in facial recognition (by a long shot) but they will without a doubt make facial recognition competitive by making it better. This is how they always work. - Leprecon The lack of any fingerprint reader could cause problems for people who either cover their face for religious or professional reasons as well as for blind people. Really hoping Apple thought about these issues. - danius353 The iPhone home button was what made it look like a iPhone. The little round button was so iconic.

    "text": "By Sandrine LungumbuBBC World Service But I, a black woman, made the decision that this time I wasn't going to watch the video. It is mentally and physically draining for me to watch yet another unarmed black man dying under arrest at the hands of another white police officer. I know there will be plenty of people telling me I should be glad the video went viral because it unveiled the truth - a deep social and systemic problem that has been ongoing for centuries in the US. As a journalist, what could be more important to me than getting to the truth? But over the years I have found there is a fine line between exposing these horrific acts and safeguarding my mental health, especially when the story is so deeply rooted in my own experience. I think anyone watching these videos will find them distressing, but it resonates on a completely different level for a black person like me; these images can act as traumatic triggers. 'Just too much' When I spoke to Nia Dumas, a 20-year-old African-American woman living in the US, she told me she could not stop crying after watching George Floyd's last moments. \"I have found myself crying sometimes four times a day since watching it,\" she said. \"It has been very traumatic.\" Nia lives in Cleveland, Ohio, where she has seen a lot of violence. Growing up, images of black people being killed were almost constant in her life. \"If it's not George Floyd, then it's someone else. It's just too much,\" she said. \"For me, seeing his video triggered memories of when Trayvon Martin was killed. I was around 11 years old then and it's crazy how I've been seeing stuff like this for years. I'm tired of it.\" Trayvon Martin was an unarmed black 17-year-old, shot dead by a Florida neighbourhood watchman, who was cleared of any wrongdoing in 2012 on the grounds of self-defence. It was Trayvon's killing that brought about the first use of the Black Lives Matter hashtag. 'I just felt broken' Since then, that hashtag has been used many times over, as Toni Adepegba, a 27-year-old black British man, told me when we spoke about racism and its impact on mental health. \"It's been a heavy month,\" he said, \"only weeks since the video of Ahmaud Arbery's video surfaced. I had barely recovered from seeing the images of Ahmaud's killing and then I saw it happening again.\" Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was jogging when he was shot dead during a confrontation with a father and son in the US state of Georgia. For Toni, watching George Floyd's final moments was almost too much to take in. \"I don't have the words to describe that feeling. I just felt broken. I just felt tired because these men could have been me.\" Earlier the same day, he had watched another viral video of a white New York woman in Central Park, who was calling the police for help after a black man, a bird watcher, asked her to put her dog on a leash, in line with the park's rules. \"This was triggering for me,\" Toni said, \"because it exposed the dynamics at play; she was aware of the privilege that she had as a white woman over a black man. \"She knew that she could get this man arrested or even killed with one phone call.\" Toni could not watch the full video of George Floyd. \"My first thought when I saw it was, 'Why are people just standing there?' But maybe they understood that they could easily be where he was.\" More on George Floyd's death In recent weeks, I have had numerous conversations about whether there is any benefit in sharing these images on social media. Paris-born Laëtitia Kandolo is a 28-year-old black woman whose family comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. She struggled to watch the George Floyd video at first. 'This is our reality' \"There were so many emotions to process. But a couple of hours later when it was just blowing up, I went back to watching. He was completely helpless, and I identified with that helplessness.\" \"We have to find a way to hold racists to account,\" says Laëtitia. \"If these videos, make those who are privileged because of their skin colour to stop and think, then so be it.\" But she added, \"It's important to remember that [white people] are watching the video, whereas we are living it - this is our reality.\" For many black people, seeing this video shared by non-black people brings up the question of authenticity. 'What do you contribute to the conversation?' Nia, from the US, is sceptical about the support she sees online, if deeper issues such as white privilege and institutional racism are not addressed. \"I have seen a lot of predominantly white celebrities sharing ready-made posts, which I think is kind of artificial,\" she said. She has seen people who genuinely want to be supportive, which she appreciates. But she is not going to \"applaud a fish for swimming\". \"I want to know how you feel, what you think as an individual, or what you contribute to the conversation, We've normalised the thinking that sharing a post, video or retweeting is showing support... We are beyond that now.\" 'It still plays on my mind' When black people come across such videos, they inevitably see themselves, or their families and their ancestors, behind a hashtag. \"I was doing a lot of running at night when Ahmaud's video came out,\" Toni said. \"It dawned on me the high likelihood that someone could see me running and just call the police with the assumption that I'm running away from a crime scene. It still plays on my mind that if I was in America, I could have been him.\" \"Every black person has a moment\", Laëtitia said, \"when they realise they are black and what that means to the world at large.\" For her, it was a conversation she had with her father when she was 18 and wanted to go to fashion school. \"He told me, 'You're black and as a black person in an artistic sphere you will struggle, you will have to worker harder than everyone one else to be seen.' I felt crushed. I cried.\" 'His story is also my story' Black people from around the world know too well that the experience of racism ranges from the extremes to the daily micro-aggressions, all rooted in the same history. In my case, growing up as an African in multicultural east London, I felt somewhat cushioned from blatant racism at first, but once I left for university to study journalism, I also had to deal with the \"real world\". My afro became a topic of conversation. It went from \"sassy hair\" to \"a mane\" to being told that I had \"moppish hair\" - which could hinder my career. The trauma that racist videos and images trigger in black people is linked to many such memories, either personal ones, or collectively shared. \"I think we are realising more than ever that George Floyd's story is also my story. We are connected and are part of a broader story,\" said Laëtitia. \"These images have historical significance and weight for black people; from the images of lynching to the mutilation of hands in Belgian Congo, these pictures are traumatic. They've been trying to kill us, but we're still here fighting to live.\" But these images can become exhausting for a black person, to the point that it may be damaging their mental health. I've felt the overwhelming pressure to continuously read, share, post and actively engage with everything on my social media feed about the latest hashtag on a racist killing, until George Floyd's video came up, when I made a conscious effort to protect myself. 'Your mental health is your priority' Toni said he also had to find a balance between engaging with the conversations about racism and protecting his mental health. \"There is a need to ensure that George Floyd is not forgotten.\" he said. \"But I've been saying this to other black people, that they shouldn't feel pressured to see these images or share them. Your mental health is your priority. \"It's not a black versus white thing, it's a humanity thing. I believe change can only happen when it stops being 'their' problem, and becomes 'our' problem.\"",

    "text": "The judges also rejected his claim that he had been denied a fair trial. Qasab, 24, was convicted of murder and other crimes in May 2010. His first appeal was rejected by the Mumbai High Court in February 2011. The November 2008 attacks claimed 166 lives. Nine gunmen were also killed. \"In view of the nature of the gravity of his crime and the fact that he participated in waging war against the country, we have no option but to uphold his death penalty,\" Supreme Court Justices Aftab Alam and CK Prasad ruled. Legal experts say it could still be months or even years before Qasab's sentence can be carried out. He has the right to appeal to the same two judges to review his case. If that fails he can take his appeal to other Supreme Court judges. His last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president. The BBC's Andrew North in Delhi says there will now be huge pressure for the death sentence to be carried out soon. A spokesman for India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said there should be \"no delay\" in executing Qasab. \"Those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy,\" he said. 'Complete victory' Prosecutor Gopal Subramaniam hailed the verdict as \"a complete victory of the due processes of law\". \"It was a case argued in a completely professional and dispassionate manner,\" Mr Subramaniam said. Defence lawyer Raju Ramachandran told reporters outside the court that he had made his arguments and \"the court considered them\". \"I bow to the verdict,\" he added. The trial court in Mumbai had found Qasab guilty on 3 May 2010 of murder, terrorist acts and waging war on India and sentenced him to death. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Qasab argued that the prosecution had \"failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt\" the charges against him. He said he \"may be guilty of killing people and carrying out a terrorist act but I am not guilty of waging war against the state\". The 60-hour siege of Mumbai began on 26 November 2008, targeting luxury hotels, the main railway station and a Jewish cultural centre. Qasab and an accomplice carried out the assault on the station, killing 52 people. India blamed Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attacks. After initial denials, Pakistan acknowledged that the assault had been partially planned on its territory and that Qasab was a Pakistani citizen.",

    "text": "Rajput was found dead in his flat in Mumbai on 14 June. Police said he had killed himself. Since then, unverified details about his career, financial status and even mental health have dominated headlines. It has led to a tussle over who has jurisdiction to investigate - police in Mumbai or his home state Bihar. A single judge bench of the Supreme Court said that the Bihar government was competent to request the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). It has also asked the Mumbai police to hand over all evidence collected so far to the investigating agency. His family, who have filed a case of abetment to suicide against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, have also been asking for the case to be transferred away from Mumbai. On social media, she has been called a \"gold digger\" who \"took away Sushant's money\". She has denied any wrongdoing and issued a plea to Home Minister Amit Shah for a fair investigation into Sushant's death. She had also moved the court asking that the case be heard in Mumbai. She has since been questioned by various investigative agencies. Who was Sushant Singh Rajput? Sushant Singh Rajput lived an extraordinary life - just like some of the characters he played in his hit Bollywood films. He grew up in Bihar, one of India's poorest states. He worked hard and was admitted to one of India's top engineering colleges - a sure way of securing a bright future for middle class families. But his heart was set on acting. So he dropped out of college and went to Mumbai - the home of Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry. He did small roles, took up odd jobs and worked in theatre for years until one of his TV shows became a hit. Success on the big screen followed soon. His story fired the ambitions of young people in small towns - it's why many of his fans took his death as a personal loss. Why has his death been so controversial? With heartbroken fans looking for answers over why he may have taken such a drastic step, unverified details about Sushant's career, financial status, relationships and even mental health started circulating on social media and in debates on news channels. No-one has been spared by the voyeuristic coverage - his therapist, his former cook, his friends, his manager, his family, his colleagues have all been hounded for interviews and exclusives. With police drip-feeding details to the media, the mystery around his death has only deepened. Days after he died, some social media users claimed that he killed himself because a few powerful Bollywood families and directors had treated him unfairly. They said he was an outsider who had no \"godfather\" in the industry, and that his rise was unacceptable to certain Bollywood dynasties. They pointed to recent reports of him being side-lined after he was promised roles in big-budget films. The Mumbai police has been investigating what led to the actor's death. They have interviewed more than 50 people from the film industry to find out if there is enough evidence to file abetment of suicide charges. The officers are yet to file a final report. The allegations led to a severe backlash on social media against some directors and producers. While this debate raged, some channels turned their focus on Rhea Chakraborty, Sushant's actress girlfriend.

    "text": "Kurdish officials said the situation in Dohuk city, with 150,000 refugees, was now critical. But the US said a rescue mission to aid thousands who fled to Mount Sinjar was unlikely as it had found fewer people and better conditions than expected The UN estimates that 1.2 million Iraqis have been internally displaced. The three other countries that have the same emergency status are Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Speeding up response The declaration by the UN of a \"Level 3 Emergency\" would \"facilitate mobilisation of additional resources in goods, funds and assets\" to support the humanitarian operation, said UN special representative Nickolay Mladenov. The situation of displaced people on Mount Sinjar remained critical, he said. The UN had estimated that tens of thousands of people, most from the Christian and Yazidi religious minorities, were besieged on the mountain after being forced to flee their homes. But US forces sent to Mt Sinjar found fewer people than expected - partly because thousands had left the mountain each night over the past days. The US says it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and it conducted its seventh air drop of food and water on Wednesday. It has also continued to conduct air strikes on IS targets. Bayan Abdul Rahman, who represents the Kurdish regional government in the UK, said the number of trapped refugees should be no excuse for inaction. They should be rescued whether there were \"5,000 or 50,000\" of them, he said. The situation in the region was \"fluid\" and there was no guarantee that IS fighters won't attack again, he added. Harrowing escape Hamad, a Yazidi who managed to escape with his family, told the BBC that his mother had died during their long journey to Dohuk. \"There was no food. We were exhausted after a lot of walking and climbing high, steep roads,\" he said, adding that his mother eventually said she could go no further. \"We refused to leave without her. After a few hours of thirst, hunger and exhaustion, she fell and passed away.\" Kurdish officials in Dohuk told the BBC's Frank Gardner some 150,000 refugees had arrived, overwhelming the local population who are trying to feed them. In another development, the governor of Anbar province - large parts of which have been under militant control for months - has asked for US air support and other assistance, Reuters reports. France says it will arm Iraq's Kurds, who are already getting US military aid to fight IS. Meanwhile, the UK has pledged to join a rescue mission for displaced civilians. The rapid IS advance across Iraq has thrown the country into chaos. On 29 June, the group said it had created a caliphate, or Islamic state, stretching from Aleppo in Syria to the province of Diyala in Iraq. Iraq's military response to the threat has been hampered by political chaos in Baghdad. Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's coalition won the most seats in April's elections but parliament has not agreed to give him a third term. Earlier this week, Iraq's president asked the deputy speaker of parliament, Haider al-Abadi, to form a new government but Mr Maliki vowed to contest the move in court. Former Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, who served under Mr Maliki until last month, said Iraq's prime minister has no choice but to \"accept the wishes of the majority of Iraqis\". \"We are hopeful Maliki will be more realistic and save face,\" he told the BBC. Mr Zebari also dismissed fears that Iraq could fall apart, saying the Kurdish leadership had \"decided to be part of the new government\".",

    "text": "\"I'm willing to admit my guilt and to show repentance,\" said reporter Chen Yongzhou. He was arrested over claims he defamed a partly state-owned firm in articles exposing alleged corruption. State media said he had admitted writing false stories for money. Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently. Public confessions have long been a part of China's criminal law. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing says it is impossible to know whether the admission was forced out of him. Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite an amendment to the criminal procedure law earlier this year forbidding the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves. 'Hankered after money' Mr Chen wrote several articles for the Guangdong-based New Express newspaper alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion. The company denies the allegations. \"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust,\" he told state broadcaster CCTV. \"I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame. I've been used. I've realised my wrongdoing.\" State media said he had confessed to taking bribes, but did not report who might have paid the bribes. His case attracted huge attention after the New Express twice used its front page to call for his release. The newspaper has not yet commented on the confession. Media monitoring group China Digital Times reported that the Communist Party's propaganda department had barred newspapers from reporting the story. An instruction from the department also warned papers to monitor reporters' individual social-media accounts. But many newspapers have continued to cover the story. The Southern Metropolis Daily published an editorial accusing officials in Zoomlion's hometown of Changsha of abuse of power over the case. According to the Hong Kong-based China Media Project, the paper had to pull an earlier editorial under pressure from censors. China's newspaper industry is tightly controlled by a system of local censors carrying out party directives. But there have been several high-profile rows over censorship. Earlier this year staff at the Guangzhou-based Southern Weekly paper went on strike after a new-year editorial calling for reform was censored.",

    "text": "Though there has been no comment from the authorities in Pyongyang, South Korean officials and US experts reported the restoration. Some analysts say the country's web access was cut entirely for a time. China meanwhile has denounced reports suggesting it was responsible for the North Korean online shutdown. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that such reports were \"speculative\" and had \"no basis in reality\". \"These reports themselves are extremely irresponsible, unprofessional and misleading,\" she added. China's permanent representative to the United Nations has called for all sides to avoid an escalation of tension on the Korean Peninsula after the UN Security Council put the North's human rights record on its agenda. Analysis: Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul There is a paradox. North Korea is highly \"teched up\" but is denied the world wide web. Many people have smart phones, for example, but they cannot access the web with them. The authorities take great pains to prevent citizens from accessing the internet. Recently, embassies in Pyongyang were told they could not have wifi networks within the building. It transpired that demand for neighbouring property had risen because residents there could get access to the embassies' wifi. What North Korea does have is an intranet, its own internal internet with a lot of state-controlled news websites disseminating the party line, but also a cookery website. Ordinary North Koreans are unlikely to notice the absence of the internet because they were denied it anyway. But they might notice the disappearance of their own online newspapers and sources of news. And also the cookery website. 'Proportional response' South Korean officials say the websites of the North Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper - the main official news outlets - were up and running on Tuesday after earlier being shut down. Among the stories online were posts glorifying the ruling Kim family, including an article about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visiting a catfish farm. The US earlier said it would launch a proportional response to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which made a comedy about Kim Jong-un. Officials would not comment on any US involvement in the current outages. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says that the attack on the North's internet may have been meant as a message to Kim Jong-un that his country was vulnerable. Internet services were partially restored after nine hours and 31 minutes of disruption, cyber security firm Dyn Research says. While most mainstream North Korean websites are back online, the recovery initially appeared to be partial and potentially unstable with some websites still inaccessible. Analysts had said technical problems or a cyber-attack could be to blame. Doug Madory of Dyn Research said they had seen a progressive degradation of North Korea's connectivity to the outside world until the point at which they were totally offline. Arbor Networks, an internet technology service, said it had detected denial-of-service attacks against North Korea's infrastructure beginning on Saturday. Only a small proportion of people have access to the internet in North Korea, one of the world's most secretive countries. Vulnerable connection North Korea's internet is handled by state-run company Star Joint Ventures, which in turn is routed through Chinese telecommunications firm China Unicom. Dyn's chief scientist, James Cowie, told the BBC that if it were indeed an attack, \"it would not take a tremendous effort to carry out\". \"It is one connection across the border... to overload the routing infrastructure would probably not require the efforts of a nation-state, it could be just one dedicated person,\" he added. Last week, the US government said an FBI investigation had shown that North Korea was behind a hacking attack on Sony, which led to unreleased films and private emails being leaked online. North Korea denied being responsible but praised the attack. It had for months condemned a Sony comedy, The Interview, which depicts the assassination of the North Korean leader. Sony eventually cancelled the cinema release of the film. Mr Obama had said that the US would respond to the attack on Sony \"in a place and time and manner that we choose\". The internet disruption came as the UN Security Council discussed North Korea's human rights for the first time, despite opposition from China and Russia. US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power dismissed North Korea's demand to launch a joint investigation with the US into the attack on Sony. She said threats to retaliate if the US refused was \"the kind of behaviour we have come to expect from a regime that threatened to take 'merciless countermeasures' against the US over a Hollywood comedy\". North Korea has \"no qualms about holding tens of thousands of people in harrowing gulags,\" she added. North Korean diplomat Kim Song said a decision on how to respond to the Security Council's move would be made in Pyongyang. \"We totally reject the decision to bring DPRK [North Korea's] human rights record to the UN Security Council,\" he told Reuters.",

    "text": "In addition, the prime minister said possessing online pornography depicting rape would become illegal in England and Wales - in line with Scotland. Mr Cameron warned in a speech that access to online pornography was \"corroding childhood\". The new measures will apply to both existing and new customers. Mr Cameron also called for some \"horrific\" internet search terms to be \"blacklisted\", meaning they would automatically bring up no results on websites such as Google or Bing. He told the BBC he expected a \"row\" with service providers who, he said in his speech, were \"not doing enough to take responsibility\" despite having a \"moral duty\" to do so. He also warned he could have to \"force action\" by changing the law and that, if there were \"technical obstacles\", firms should use their \"greatest brains\" to overcome them. 'Innocence' In his speech, Mr Cameron said family-friendly filters would be automatically selected for all new customers by the end of the year - although they could choose to switch them off. And millions of existing computer users would be contacted by their internet providers and told they must decide whether to use or not use \"family-friendly filters\" to restrict adult material. The filters would apply to all devices linked to the affected home Wi-Fi network and across the public Wi-Fi network \"wherever children are likely to be present\". Customers who do not click on either option - accepting or declining - will have filters activated by default, Tory MP Claire Perry, Mr Cameron's adviser on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood, told the BBC. The UK's biggest internet service providers have agreed to the filters scheme meaning it should cover 95% of homes. Other measures announced by the prime minister included: Mr Cameron also called for warning pages to pop up with helpline numbers when people try to search for illegal content. He said: \"I want to talk about the internet, the impact it is having on the innocence of our children, how online pornography is corroding childhood. \"And how, in the darkest corners of the internet, there are things going on that are a direct danger to our children, and that must be stamped out. \"I'm not making this speech because I want to moralise or scaremonger, but because I feel profoundly as a politician, and as a father, that the time for action has come. This is, quite simply, about how we protect our children and their innocence.\" But former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre boss Jim Gamble told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to \"get to the root cause\" of illegal pornography, by catching those responsible for creating it. He added: \"You need a real deterrent, not a pop-up that paedophiles will laugh at.\" But Ms Perry argued filters would make a difference, saying that the killers of schoolgirls April Jones and Tia Sharp had accessed legal pornography before moving on to images of child abuse. She added: \"It's impossible to buy this material in a sex shop... but it's possible to have it served up on a computer every day.\" In his speech, Mr Cameron said possession of online pornography depicting rape would be made illegal. Existing legislation only covers publication of pornographic portrayals of rape, as opposed to possession. \"Possession of such material is already an offence in Scotland but because of a loophole in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, it is not an offence south of the border,\" Mr Cameron said. \"Well I can tell you today we are changing that. We are closing the loophole - making it a criminal offence to possess internet pornography that depicts rape.\" The move has been welcomed by women's groups and academics who had campaigned to have \"rape porn\" banned. Holly Dustin, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the group was \"delighted\". \"The coalition government has pledged to prevent abuse of women and girls, so tackling a culture that glorifies abuse is critical for achieving this,\" she said. \"The next step is working with experts to ensure careful drafting of the law and proper resourcing to ensure the law is enforced fully.\" 'No safe place' Mr Cameron, who has faced criticism from Labour over cuts to Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre's funding, insisted the centre's experts and police would be given the powers needed to keep pace with technological changes on the internet. \"Let me be clear to any offender who might think otherwise: there is no such thing as a safe place on the internet to access child abuse material,\" he said. A spokesman for Google said: \"We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery. Whenever we discover it, we respond quickly to remove and report it. \"We recently donated $5m (£3.3m) to help combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the government on these issues.\" According to some experts, \"default on\" can create a dangerous sense of complacency, says BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. He says internet service providers would dispute Mr Cameron's interpretation of the new measures, insisting they did not want to be seen as censors.",

    "text": "Tens of thousands of people have been blocking streets in several areas. The protesters want Beijing to give Hong Kong a free vote for its next leader, something Beijing has rejected. Occupy Central has called on Mr Leung to meet protesters in person on Tuesday night. During a news conference, the pro-democracy group also said it would open \"humanitarian corridors\" in protest areas to allow emergency vehicles to pass. The streets were relatively quiet on Tuesday, with people mainly sleeping and clearing up. But crowds were expected set to swell ahead of Chinese National Day on 1 October. Wednesday is a national holiday marking the founding of Communist China. At the weekend police used tear gas and pepper spray, but riot police have since been withdrawn and protesters remain calm. Key parts of the city are being blocked by protesters, with some schools and banks closed. The protesters want Mr Leung, the chief executive, to step down. But he appeared to reject their demand, saying that his removal would mean Hong Kong's next leader being chosen by a committee, as in 2012, rather than by voters. He also called on the protesters - who include students, supporters of the Occupy Central group and others angered by the police response to the protests - to go home. \"Occupy Central founders had said repeatedly that if the movement is getting out of control, they would call for it to stop,\" Mr Leung said. \"I'm now asking them to fulfil the promise they made to society, and stop this campaign immediately.\" At the scene: Saira Asher, BBC News, Hong Kong Thousands of pro-democracy protesters spent Monday night on the street near Admiralty in Hong Kong's Central district. Some were propped up against barricades, others stretched out in the middle of a major road. After a strong show last night, the crowds have trickled out this morning as people go to work or home to take care of household chores. But they say they will be back later in the evening. This has been the routine now for two days. The crowds diminish in the day but return in full force and stay the night. The morning was spent mostly removing rubbish left over from last night's huge crowd. Students picked up cigarette butts and plastic bottles, others distributed breakfast buns. That is why those on the street are being called \"the politest protesters\" by some on social media. But they are on edge. At one point last night, everyone suddenly stood up and started pulling on masks. It turned out to be just a changing of the guard for the handful of police scattered around here, but the sudden fear was palpable. 'Condemned by history' Beijing ruled last month that Hong Kong people could elect their next leader in 2017. But the choice of candidates will be restricted to two or three people who must be approved by the majority of a pro-Beijing committee - meaning Beijing can effectively screen candidates. In Hong Kong, further consultations had been due to take place on the ruling but on Monday a senior official said these would be postponed until a \"better time\". Occupy Central has accused the government of \"delay tactics\", saying it believed the government was \"just hoping people's desire for genuine universal suffrage to fade out over time\". On Tuesday the group said the areas of Mong Kok, Admiralty and Causeway Bay - where protesters have been blocking roads - would become known among protesters as Democracy Square. In other developments: Not everyone in Hong Kong backs the protests. Some fear the ongoing demonstrations could affect relations with Beijing or hit the economy of the financial hub. China has called the demonstrations illegal and urged the Hong Kong government to bring them under control. News of the protests is being heavily censored in mainland China. Media have blamed \"radical opposition forces\" for stirring up trouble. Analysts say Communist Party leaders in Beijing are worried that calls for democracy could spread to cities on the mainland, putting them in a very difficult position. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees liberties not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and the right to protest.

Moody's said the change in outlook was based on expectations that Beijing's fiscal strength would continue to decline. The negative outlook comes on the heels of fresh data suggesting China's economy is continuing to lose steam. Moody's said it was concerned over China's incomplete implementation of much needed reforms. High debt burden \"Without credible and efficient reforms, China's GDP growth would slow more markedly as a high debt burden dampens business investment and demographics turn increasingly unfavourable,\" Moody's said in a note. \"Government debt would increase more sharply than we currently expect.\" But the ratings agency did confirm China's current Aa3 rating, saying that there was still time to address the current economic imbalances and implement reforms. Just one week ago, China sought to assure the global economic community over the strength of its economy. At the G20 meeting in Shanghai, the country's finance minister Lou Jiwei insisted Beijing could tackle the pressures it is currently facing. China's economy, the second-biggest in the world, is growing at the slowest rate in 25 years as it attempts to move from an export-led nation to one led by consumption and services. The slowdown in China's economy has created considerable uncertainty in financial markets and has led to sharp falls in commodity prices.",

The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Programme was the brainchild of Harry Reid, a retired Democratic senator who was the Senate majority leader at the time. He told the New York Times: \"I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going.

The programme is reported to have cost the Department of Defense more than $20 million (£15m) before it was shut down in order to save costs. Although its funding ended in 2012, officials have reportedly continued to investigate sightings of unusual aerial phenomena and suspicious objects alongside their daily duties. One former congressional staffer told Politico the programme may have been set up to monitor the technological progress of rival foreign powers. \"Was this China or Russia trying to do something or has some propulsion system we are not familiar with?\", they said.

    "text": "Pte First Class Bradley Manning, 25, was convicted in July of 20 charges against him, including espionage. In a statement read by his lawyer after the sentencing, Pte Manning said he had acted \"out of love for our country\". His supporters have called on President Barack Obama to pardon the soldier or commute his sentence to time served. Parole in seven? Pte Manning will receive a credit against his sentence of about three and a half years, including time he has already served in jail and 112 days in recompense for the harsh conditions of his initial confinement. His defence lawyer David Coombs said Pte Manning would first be eligible for parole in about seven years. Prosecutors had asked for a 60-year sentence in order to send a message to future potential leakers, and Wikileaks called the 35-year sentence a \"significant strategic victory\". Military prosecutors did not immediately comment. In addition to the prison sentence, likely to be served at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Judge Col Denise Lind sentenced Pte Manning to be demoted to private and dishonourably discharged from the US Army, and to forfeit his pay. While stationed in Iraq in 2010, the junior intelligence analyst passed hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports and diplomatic cables to Wikileaks, the pro-transparency group headed by Julian Assange. 'End Brad's suffering' Pte Manning has said he leaked the secret files in the hopes of sparking a public debate about US foreign policy and the military. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Coombs, flanked by Manning supporters, said he would ask President Obama to pardon Pte Manning. \"The time to end Brad's suffering is now,\" he said. Mr Coombs read a statement from Pte Manning that will be included in the request. \"The decisions I made in 2010 were made out of a concern for my country and the world we live in,\" Pte Manning said, according to Mr Coombs. \"When I chose to disclose classified information... I did so out of love for our country and a sense of duty for others. If you deny my request for a pardon I will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society.\" Mr Coombs also read a statement from the soldier's family, which said they were \"saddened and disappointed\" by the sentence. For his own part, the lawyer said he was in tears after the sentence was handed down but that Pte Manning had told him: \"I know you did your best. It's going to be OK.\" When asked about the pardon request, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he was \"not going to get ahead\" of the process. The soldier's uncle, Kevin Fox, of Haverfordwest, Wales, said the family had expected a harsher sentence. \"In my honest opinion, he shouldn't have been given any time at all,\" Mr Fox told the BBC. \"In my eyes he is a hero.\" The verdict and sentence will be reviewed, and possibly reduced, by a military district commander and will be automatically reviewed by the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. Pte Manning may also petition the court for lenience during the appeals process. Isolated deployment The young soldier grew up in Oklahoma and in Wales, where his mother is from, and reportedly joined the US Army to help pay for college. As an intelligence analyst, he had access to a large amount of very sensitive information, despite his junior rank. He deployed to Iraq in 2009 and soon became disillusioned with the war, his defence lawyer has said. A military psychiatrist testified that Pte Manning had struggled with his gender identity and wanted to become a woman at the time of the leak. Navy Capt David Moulton testified that Pte Manning had felt abandoned by friends and family and that his relationship with his boyfriend had hit a rough patch. According to evidence presented by the defence, military supervisors ignored Pte Manning's erratic behaviour, which included trying to grab a gun during a counselling session. 'In a cage' His lawyers said such actions had shown that Pte Manning had not been fit for duty overseas. Defence lawyers said Pte Manning was treated unfairly in solitary confinement in Quantico, Virginia and in a cell at Camp Arifjan, a US Army installation in Kuwait. Pte Manning told the court he remembered thinking: \"I'm going to die, I'm stuck inside this cage.\" The leaks enabled Wikileaks to publish sensitive messages between US diplomats and records of military incidents in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a cockpit video showing an Apache helicopter killing 12 people in the Iraqi capital in 2007. The revelations caused significant embarrassment to the US government, and its officials have said the disclosures damaged America's relations with its allies and disrupted the war effort in Afghanistan.",

    "text": "European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso made the announcement following President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. The US said that \"everything is on the table\" in the talks. A deal would bring down trading barriers between the two biggest economies in the world. EU-US trade is worth around 455bn euros (£393bn; $613bn) a year. \"A future deal between the world's two most important economic powers will be a game-changer, giving a strong boost to our economies on both sides of the Atlantic,\" said Mr Barroso, speaking in Brussels. The EU estimates that a \"comprehensive and ambitious agreement\" will boost annual GDP growth by 0.5%. Mr Obama announced US support for talks as part of his annual address to the US Congress on Tuesday, saying a free-trade deal would \"boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia\". It is not clear how long the talks will take, but similar trade deals have involved years of negotiations, and the BBC's Gavin Hewitt in Brussels says the most optimistic timeframe given by European officials is two years. A US-EU working group was established in 2011 to discuss the prospect of a free-trade agreement. The US trade representative, Ron Kirk, said that even sensitive issues such as agricultural subsidies will be up for discussion. \"For us, everything is on the table, across all sectors, including across the agricultural sector, whether it is GMOs [genetically modified organisms] or other issues,\" Mr Kirk said. \"We should be ambitious and we should deal with all of these issues.\" Low tariffs EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told the BBC that free trade between the US and the EU had been under discussion for several years, and said he hoped talks would begin in the summer. But he admitted that the negotiations would be \"difficult\" and \"complex\", but he warned: \"As the two biggest economies in the world, failure is not an option.\" The EU says the deal will focus on bringing down remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade, and standardise technical regulations and certifications. Currently the US and EU impose relatively low tariffs on goods traded between them, but analysts say other barriers are often in place to prevent European companies competing in the US and vice versa. One example is found in the car industry, where the EU and the US employ equally strict - but differing - safety standards, meaning that European car makers must meet both before they can sell cars in the US market, putting them at a disadvantage. Mr De Gucht estimates that such barriers are equivalent to a traditional imports tariff of 10-20%. Rise of China Agriculture is also likely to be a significant bone of contention. The European farming industry is already heavily subsidised through the Common Agricultural Policy, and the European agriculture minister has already expressed reservations about the impact a free-trade deal might have. The US government is also likely to come under pressure from domestic businesses who have in the past called for protectionist measures to prevent the market from being swamped by cheaper Chinese imports. The EU has already said that certain \"sensitive\" sectors will require more negotiation but said no sectors would be excluded from the deal completely. The chief European economist at Barclays, Philippe Gudin, suggested that the emergence of China as an economic power along with other emerging markets has encouraged the US and Europe to unify in order to remain economic leaders. Mr De Gucht denied that they were seeking to combat Chinese growth, saying: \"We are the leading economies and it's important that we remain the leaders, but in a way that allows others to develop.\" Steve Davies from the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank, said he believed the economic crisis in Europe was a far more important factor. \"It's happening now because there has been seriously depressed growth in the EU, and this will be good news for economic growth,\" he said. \"On the American side, the critical factor is that Obama is now in his second term, so he doesn't have the protectionist pressures from US businesses to worry about.\"",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \"This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. \"In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better.\" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification Dr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was \"not a terribly accurate classification system\". She told the BBC: \"This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease.\" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: \"There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. \"Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow.\" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: \"Clearly this is only the first step. \"We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes.\" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help \"personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future\". She added: \"This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition.\" Follow James on Twitter",

    "text": "Mr Cook made his announcement to try to help people struggling with their identity, he wrote in a Bloomberg Businessweek article. He has been open about his sexuality, but has also tried to maintain a basic level of privacy until now, he said. This week Mr Cook challenged his home state of Alabama to ensure the rights of gay and transgender people. Privacy trade-off \"While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven't publicly acknowledged it either, until now,\" he wrote. \"So let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,\" he added. He said he didn't consider himself an activist, but that he realised he had \"benefited from the sacrifice of others.\" \"So if hearing that the CEO [chief executive] of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy,\" he added. Mr Cook said that he had been open about his sexuality with many people, including colleagues at Apple, but that it still \"wasn't an easy choice\" to publicly announce his sexual orientation. He quoted civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King, saying: \"Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?' \" Analysis Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent Tim Cook's announcement may come as no surprise in Silicon Valley or across corporate America. But that does not mean that we should underestimate the significance of the leader of the world's most valuable company talking openly about his sexuality. Back in May, a piece in the New York Times asked \"where are the gay chief executives?\" and struggled to name any openly gay CEOs at America's 1,000 biggest companies. Apple under Steve Jobs was not a company that took a stand on any issues which were not seen as relevant to its business. Tim Cook has been more forthcoming on all sorts of issues, including equal rights for gay workers, and while he says he does not see himself as an activist, that is how many will now see him. That could embroil him in controversy in the United States, let alone in other parts of the world with less liberal views of sexuality. Mr Cook admitted that going public as a gay man was not an easy choice - but it certainly looks a courageous one. This week Mr Cook referred to Martin Luther King in a speech in Alabama in which he called for equal rights for people based on sexual orientation and identity. He said that Alabama had been too slow to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities in the civil rights era, and was now being too slow to guarantee gay rights. \"Under the law, citizens of Alabama can still be fired based on their sexual orientation,\" Mr Cook said. \"We can't change the past, but we can learn from it and we can create a different future.\" Mr Cook has championed equality at Apple, but in August said he was \"not satisfied\" with workforce diversity at the company. Outstanding, a not-for-profit professional network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) executives, said on Thursday that many LGBT people in the UK felt it was \"safer to stay in the closet\" when at work. In May a US study by LGBT organisation Human Rights Campaign suggested that 53% of US LGBT employees had not come out at work. 'Role model' Former BP chief executive Lord Browne, who now chairs fracking company Cuadrilla, said Mr Cook had become a role model. \"By deciding to speak publicly about his sexuality, Tim Cook has become a role model, and will speed up changes in the corporate world,\" Lord Browne said. The peer kept his sexual orientation a secret for decades, but was forced to come out after a boyfriend made his sexuality public in 2007. Lord Browne later resigned after losing a court battle with a newspaper.",

She has to pay a 1bn rupee ($16m; £10m) fine and resign as chief minister. A former actress, her life has been marked by a series of high and lows. The verdict was delivered by a special court in Bangalore amid tight security. Along with three others, Jayalalitha was sentenced to an immediate jail term, and was due to be sent to Parappana Agrahara prison in Bangalore. But she complained on chest pains and giddiness after the verdict was delivered, the Times of India reported, and was sent to the prison hospital for assessment. Analysis: Andrew North, BBC News, Delhi Many Indians will applaud the conviction of Tamil Nadu's chief minister - after years of evading justice - in the hope it is another move towards cleaning up the country's notoriously criminalised political system. India's Supreme Court has tightened the noose, disqualifying from office any MP convicted of a serious crime and ordering fast-track trials to prevent them using their influence to string things out. But there is no bar to the many politicians who continue to execute policy while facing charges that would see them immediately suspended in most other democracies, until either their innocence or guilt is proven. New Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised cleaner government, yet just under one-third of the ministers he appointed face criminal charges, with one even accused of attempted murder. India's Supreme Court recently ruled that while the constitution allows Mr Modi to do this, he should set a better example on who he appoints. The prosecution argued that Jayalalitha and three others committed an offence against society, the Indian Express reported. The court has sentenced all four accused to four years in prison each, with Jayalalitha also facing a 1bn rupee fine ($16m, £10m). The others have been ordered to pay a fine of about $1.6m each. If any of the four fail to pay their fine their jail sentence will be extended by a year. It said that supporters of AIADMK party were forcibly dispersed by police as they tried to make their way to the court.

    "text": "By Subir BhaumikGuwahati One day in May, 88-year-old Ashraf Ali told his family he was going to fetch food to break his Ramadan fast. Instead, he took poison and killed himself. Mr Ali and his family had been included in a list of people deemed to have proven they were \"Indian\". But his inclusion was challenged by a neighbour, and Mr Ali was summoned to prove his citizenship again, failing which he would be detained. \"He feared he would be taken to a detention centre and his name excluded from the final list,\" fellow villager Mohammed Ghani said. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) - as the list in Assam is called - was created in 1951 to determine who was born in the state and is Indian, and who might be a migrant from neighbouring, Muslim-majority East Pakistan, as it was known then. It is now called Bangladesh. The register is being updated for the first time. It counts as Indian citizens those who can prove they were residents of Assam before 24 March 1971 - the day before Bangladesh declared its independence from Pakistan. India's government says the register is needed to identify illegal migrants to the state. Last July, the government published a \"final draft\" of the list which left out about four million people currently living in Assam. They are overwhelmingly ethnic Bengali, both Hindus and Muslims. Earlier this week the authorities announced that another 100,000 Assam residents, included in the NRC last year, had now been excluded from the register and must prove their citizenship all over again. More than half of the total number are appealing against their exclusion, before the final version of the NRC is released on 31 July. Added to the registration exercise, scores of tribunals have been set up in the state since the late 1980s. They regularly identify \"doubtful voters\" or \"illegal infiltrators\" as foreigners to be deported. Both the citizen's register and the tribunals have sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. At the heart of Assam's troubles is a debate over so-called \"infiltration\" by outsiders, which has led to ethnic tension between the indigenous population and Bengali migrants. Changing demography, loss of land and livelihoods and intensified competition for political power has added a deadly potency to the issue of who has a right to live in the state. Fearing possible loss of citizenship and detention after exclusion from the list, scores of Bengali Hindus and Muslims have killed themselves since the process to update the citizen register started in 2015, activists say. Zamser Ali of the organisation Citizens for Justice and Peace provided a list of 51 such suicides in Assam, which he said were linked to \"trauma and stress\" over anticipated loss of citizenship. He said most of the suicides occurred after January 2018, when the first draft of the updated register was made public. Prasenjit Biswas, another rights activist, called the register a \"humanitarian disaster in the making, with tens of thousands of genuine citizens being turned stateless, defying all logic of natural justice\". Read more on the NRC: Assam police admit the deaths are \"unnatural\", but say they don't have enough evidence to link them to the citizenship exercise. Abdul Kalam Azad, a researcher, has been tracking cases of suicide since the process of updating the list began in 2015. \"There has been a rise in such suicides since the publication of the final draft of the NRC last year,\" he said. \"I have been visiting people related to the victims. Those who took their lives were either declared 'doubtful voters' or dropped from the NRC. It is all very sad.\" Samsul Haque, 46, a daily wage labourer in Assam's Barpeta district, killed himself last November because his wife, Maleka Khatun, was not included in the list, according to Zamser Ali, the rights activist. Ms Maleka, declared a \"doubtful voter\" in 2005, had won her case at a foreigners tribunal in Barpeta, but she could not get her name included in the voter list or on the NRC. In some cases, the shadow of the NRC has caused tragedy across generations. In March this year, Bhaben Das, 49, a daily wage labourer in the state's Udalgiri district killed himself. His family said he could not repay the loans he had taken to pay for legal fees. Despite Mr Das's lawyers filing a case for his inclusion in the NRC, his name was missing from the list in July. Thirty years ago, his father killed himself, after a tribunal ordered him to prove he was not a foreigner. The tribunal eventually declared him Indian, several few months after his death. When school teacher and lawyer Nirode Baran Das was found dead in his house in Kharupetia township, friends and relatives said they found three documents by his bedside - the NRC notification declaring him a foreigner, a handwritten note saying no-one in the family was responsible for his death, and a letter for his wife asking her to pay back some small loans he had taken from friends. \"He graduated from the local high school in 1968 and then taught there for 30 years. His school leaving certificate proves he is not a foreigner. The NRC authorities are responsible for his death,\" his brother Akhil Chandra Das said. The BBC recently highlighted the case of decorated Indian army veteran, Mohammed Sanaullah. He spent 11 days in a detention camp in June after being declared a \"foreigner\", prompting national outrage. \"I risked my life for India. I will remain Indian. This process is totally flawed,\" Mr Sanaullah said after his release. With the Assam state government rushing to finalise the list within the Supreme Court-ordered deadline of 31 July, hundreds of thousands of Bengali Hindus and Muslims face being made stateless. \"Many of the four million excluded from the NRC draft list will not be able to make it to the final list, maybe more than half of them,\" said Hafiz Rashid Choudhury, a local lawyer. \"Their future is really bleak.\" If you've been affected by a mental health issue, help and support is available.

    "text": "The temple in Kerala barred women of a \"menstruating age\" - defined as between the ages of 10 and 50 - from entering. Menstruating women are not allowed to participate in religious rituals or enter temples, as they are considered \"unclean\" in Hinduism. The ruling came after a petition argued the custom violated gender equality. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it is one of a few temples that does not allow women in the broad age group to enter at all. Millions of devotees visit Sabarimala every year. In the judgment Chief Justice Dipak Misra said that \"religion is for one dignity and identity\", adding that \"the right to practise religion is available to both men and women\". The impending retirement of Justice Misra has seen a flurry of historic liberal rulings from the court in recent days, including the striking down of colonial-era laws that criminalised adultery and gay sex. Justice Misra, who will retire on Tuesday, was heading a five-judge bench which gave a 4-1 verdict. The BBC's Soutik Biswas says such a stream of judgements leading up to a judge's retirement in the top court is not unusual. \"But what it also underlines is that the 25 judges of the court are some of the most overworked in the world - one study found that a single Supreme Court judge, during his tenure over four to six years, hears some 6,000 cases alone,\" our correspondent adds. Indu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, dissented with the majority verdict. \"Issues of deep religious sentiments should not be ordinarily interfered by the court... Notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion,\" she said in her dissenting opinion. 'God does not discriminate' Analysis by Geeta Pandey, BBC News For centuries, temples and shrines have cited tradition to keep women out and their managements, dominated mostly by patriarchal men, have used menstruation to keep female devotees away. But in recent years, they have faced an unprecedented challenge from women's groups. Friday's order, which accepts womens' right to worship at Sabarimala, is expected to help remove some of the stigma associated with periods. The order has not come as a surprise - Chief Justice Dipak Misra had previously questioned the validity of the practice, saying that since God does not discriminate between genders, who are we to do that? Also, in the past two years, courts have unlocked the gates of Shani Shingnapur temple and Haji Ali mosque for women. Three years ago, the Sabarimala temple chief said he would allow women to enter the shrine only after a scanner was invented to detect if they were \"pure\"- meaning they weren't menstruating. Today, the judges have told him that we won't be needing that scanner anymore. The state government of Kerala had opposed the entry of women when the case was first taken up in 2016. However it changed its stance in a recent hearing to support the petitioners instead. At a hearing in July, petitioners argued that this custom violated equality guaranteed under India's constitution. They added that it was prejudiced against women and their right to worship. But supporters of the ban argued that the practice had been in effect for centuries, and there was no need to change it now. The campaign to repeal the ban on women entering the temple gathered momentum in 2016 after a protest by female students. One of the protesters also started a #HappyToBleed campaign on Facebook against \"sexist attitudes\", which received support from different parts of the country. Nikita Azad, who started the campaign, told the BBC this is a historic judgement. \"It will have a large impact since the Supreme Court has destigmatised menstruation and upheld equality over religion,\" she said. This is the third religious site in India where women have gained the right to enter through judicial intervention. Courts directed authorities of the Hindu temple Shani Shingapur and the Muslim Haji Ali shrine, both in the western state of Maharashtra, to allow women inside. What is the significance of the Sabarimala temple? Sabarimala is one of the most prominent Hindu temples in the country. Millions of devotees from all over the world visit the temple to seek blessings. To enter the temple, pilgrims have to climb 18 holy steps. According to the temple's website, the act of crossing these 18 steps is so sacred that no pilgrim can climb them without undertaking a rigorous 41-day fast. Devotees are also supposed to follow specific rituals before they enter the shrine. Some of them include pilgrims wearing only black or blue and not being allowed to shave until the completion of their pilgrimage. As part of the ritual, they also smear sandalwood paste on their foreheads.",

    "text": "By Justin HarperBusiness reporter, BBC News Sumitomo Forestry said it has started research on tree growth and the use of wood materials in space. The partnership will begin experimenting with different types of wood in extreme environments on Earth. Space junk is becoming an increasing problem as more satellites are launched into the atmosphere. Wooden satellites would burn up without releasing harmful substances into the atmosphere or raining debris on the ground when they plunge back to Earth. \"We are very concerned with the fact that all the satellites which re-enter the Earth's atmosphere burn and create tiny alumina particles which will float in the upper atmosphere for many years,\" Takao Doi, a professor at Kyoto University and Japanese astronaut, told the BBC. \"Eventually it will affect the environment of the Earth.\" \"The next stage will be developing the engineering model of the satellite, then we will manufacture the flight model,\" Professor Doi added. As an astronaut he visited the International Space Station in March 2008. During this mission, he became the first person to throw a boomerang in space that had been specifically designed for use in microgravity. Sumitomo Forestry, part of the Sumitomo Group, which was founded more than 400 years ago, said it would work on developing wooden materials highly resistant to temperature changes and sunlight. The wood it is using is an \"R&D secret\" a spokesman for the company told the BBC. Space junk Experts have warned of the increasing threat of space junk falling to Earth, as more spacecraft and satellites are launched. Satellites are increasingly being used for communication, television, navigation and weather forecasting. Space experts and researchers have been investigating different options to remove and reduce the space junk. There are nearly 6,000 satellites circling Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). About 60% of them are defunct (space junk). Research firm Euroconsult estimates that 990 satellites will be launched every year this decade, which means that by 2028, there could be 15,000 satellites in orbit. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already launched more than 900 Starlink satellites and has plans to deploy thousands more. Space junk travels at an incredibly fast speed of more than 22,300 mph, so can have cause considerable damage to any objects it hits. In 2006 a tiny piece of space junk collided with the International Space Station, taking a chip out of the heavily reinforced window.",

The 47-year-old was a volunteer on an aid convoy in December 2013 when he was seized just after crossing into Syria. The letter said anyone undertaking a humanitarian act should be held in the highest esteem. This was in contrast, they said, to the \"senseless kidnapping, murder and now despicable threats to Mr Henning at the hands of so-called 'Muslims'\". They said such actions could not be justified anywhere in the Koran or Islamic tradition, and the \"fanatics\" were not acting as Muslims but perpetrating the worst crimes against humanity. Help civilians More than 100 British Muslim imams, organisations and individuals wrote to express their \"horror and revulsion\" at the \"senseless murder\" of Briton David Haines and the threat to the life of Mr Henning. They said Mr Henning, from Eccles in Salford and who works as a taxi driver, was a volunteer who travelled to Syria to help civilians. The letter cited verses from the Koran against killing, and appealed to the kidnappers to release the married father of two immediately. Its signatories insisted that British Muslim communities would continue to do everything within their power to prevent more young men or women getting caught up in Islamic State's \"poisonous ideology\". BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt says the letter is a clear sign that many leading British Muslims are keen to distance themselves from the form of Islamist ideology being used by IS fighters to justify their actions. Video footage of Mr Henning - filmed before he was captured in Syria - has shown him describing his trips to the country. In the video, Mr Henning said: \"It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed, as you get where it needs to go. That makes it all worthwhile.\" A friend of Mr Henning from the convoy, who was with him when he was captured, has also appealed to IS to release him. Majid Freeman, 26, of Leicester, urged the militants to \"spare him\" and \"let him come home\". He also said Mr Henning was known as Gadget or Gadge among his fellow convoy members for his technical skills, and that Mr Henning had told him he felt \"at home\" in the company of the other aid volunteers. \"I remember at some point something broke down in our ambulance,\" Mr Freeman said. \"The radio wasn't working properly. Immediately he volunteered himself and he fixed the radio. \"Gadget was out on a mission. He not only wanted to help the Syrian people, he wanted to help everyone in whatever way he could help.\" Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said rescue options are limited as it is not known where Mr Henning is being held. A video showing the killing of British aid worker Mr Haines was recently released by IS. His death followed that of two US hostages which were also shown in videos.",

The DHKP-C revolutionary group said their militants had acted to avenge the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan. Before the fatal shootout, the hostage-takers said the police blamed for Elvan's death must confess and be tried by \"peoples' courts\". At the prosecutor's funeral, Justice Minister Kenan Ipek called the attack \"a gun directed at our nation\". \"We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,\" he said.

    "text": "The judge dismissed his appeal, saying it paved the way for his execution. Mullah had been scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, before gaining a reprieve. No new date has been set. He was convicted in February of crimes against humanity during the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denies the charges. Jamaat says that the trial is politically motivated. Mullah's defence lawyer Abdur Razzak told the BBC that his client had been denied justice and that the case against him relied on the testimony of just one witness. But Attorney-General Mahbubey Alam told the BBC that \"since the review petition filed by Kader Mullah has already been dismissed by our highest court - namely the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh - there is no legal bar to proceed in the execution order\". Mr Alam said that Mullah had exhausted all avenues of appeal. But Mullah's lawyers dispute his conclusions. His final hope rests with a presidential pardon. His trial earlier this year sparked protests from Jamaat supporters. They accuse the government of pursuing a political vendetta which has resulted in the imprisonment of several of the party's senior leaders. Security was stepped up in Dhaka in advance of Thursday's ruling. Mullah is one of five Islamist leaders condemned to death by Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), set up in 2010 to investigate atrocities committed during the 1971 conflict. Nobody knows exactly how many people were killed. Independent researchers think that between 300,000 and 500,000 died. The Bangladesh government puts the figure at three million. Counter-demonstrations So far none of those convicted of war crimes has been executed. Mullah - who is assistant secretary-general of Jamaat - was initially sentenced to life imprisonment for killing unarmed civilians and intellectuals in the Mirpur suburb of the capital Dhaka. Thousands of protesters took to the streets demanding the death penalty, a move that prompted parliament to amend a law allowing the state to appeal against any verdict reached by the war crimes tribunal. The Supreme Court then passed a death sentence, enraging Jammat supporters. While the government explains the need to bring war criminals to justice, Jamaat has hit back with talk of Islam being under threat. BBC Bengali Editor Sabir Mustafa says that Bangladesh is divided between Bengalis wanting to preserve their cultural and linguistic heritage and those wanting to foster a more overtly Islamist identity. Our correspondent says that the divisions go to the heart of the country's identity. The government set up the special court to deal with those accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces who attempted to stop East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then, from becoming an independent country. The two wings of Pakistan were held together mostly by a shared religion, Bangladesh broke away from Pakistan 42 years ago after a war which saw killings on a mass scale, the exodus of more than 10 million refugees and military intervention by neighbouring India. Human rights groups have said the special court falls short of international standards and that Mullah have another opportunity to appeal. Jamaat is barred from contesting elections scheduled for 5 January but plays a key role in the opposition movement led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Dr Singh, who is widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reforms programme, and is now a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party, spoke to BBC this week in an email exchange. The coronavirus pandemic ruled out a face-to-face interview and Dr Singh declined a video call. During our exchange, he laid out three steps he believes the government has to take to stem the crisis and restore economic normalcy in the coming years. First, the government should \"ensure people's livelihoods are protected and they have spending power through a significant direct cash assistance\". Second, it should make adequate capital available for businesses through \"government-backed credit guarantee programmes\". Third, it should fix the financial sector through \"institutional autonomy and processes\". India's economy was already in the throes of a slowdown before the beginning of the pandemic - GDP grew at 4.2% in the 2019-20, its slowest pace in nearly a decade. The country is now gradually unlocking its economy after a prolonged and grinding shutdown, but the future looks uncertain as infection numbers rise. On Thursday, India became the third country to pass two million Covid-19 cases. Economists have since warned that India's GDP for the 2020-21 financial year is likely to contract sharply, leading to the worst technical recession since the 1970s. \"I do not want to use words like 'depression' in a cavalier fashion,\" Dr Singh said, but a \"deep and prolonged economic slowdown\" was \"inevitable\". \"This economic slowdown is caused by a humanitarian crisis. It is important to view this from the prism of sentiments in our society than mere economic numbers and methods,\" he said. Dr Singh pointed to a consensus forming among economists over an economic contraction in India in nominal terms, \"which if it happens, will be the first time in independent India\". \"I hope the consensus is wrong,\" he said. India locked down early, at the end of March, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many believe the lockdown was hastily executed and did not anticipate the exodus of millions of out-of-work migrant workers from cities. Dr Singh believes India did what other nations were doing, and \"perhaps a lockdown at that stage was an inevitable choice\". \"But the government's shock and awe approach to the lockdown has caused tremendous pain to people. The suddenness of the announcement and the stringency of the lockdown were thoughtless and insensitive,\" he said. \"Public health emergencies such as this are best dealt with locally by local administrators and public health officials, with broad guidelines from the Centre. Perhaps, we should have devolved the Covid-19 battle to the state and local administrations much sooner.\" As finance minister, 29 years ago, Dr Singh helmed an ambitious economic reform programme in 1991 after a balance of payments crisis nearly plunged India into bankruptcy. The 1991 crisis was a domestic crisis induced by global factors, he said. \"But today's economic situation is unprecedented in its ubiquity, scale and depth.\" Not even during World War Two had the \"whole world shut down in such a synchronised fashion as it is now\", he said. In April Narendra Modi's BJP-led government announced a $266bn (£212bn) stimulus, including a range of liquidity measures and reforms to kickstart the economy. India's central bank also introduced rate cuts and moratoriums on loans. With tax receipts plummeting, economists have debated about how a cash-strapped government would be able to get the money to fund direct transfers and provide more capital to ailing banks and credit to businesses. The answer, said Dr Singh was borrowing. \"Higher borrowing is inevitable,\" he said. \"Even if we have to spend an additional 10% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to cater to the military, health and economic challenges, it must be done. He acknowledged that it would increase India's debt to GDP ratio, but if borrowing \"can save lives, borders, restore livelihoods and boost economic growth, then its worth it\", he said. \"We must not be shy of borrowing but we must be prudent on how we use that borrowing,\" he said. In the past, taking loans from multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank have been taken as signs of India's economic weaknesses. But now India could \"borrow from a position of strength, compared to other developing nations,\" Dr Singh said. \"India's track record as a borrower from multilateral institutions is impeccable, It is not a sign of weakness to borrow from these institutions.\" Many countries have decided to print money to fund government spending to tide over the ongoing economic crises, and some prominent economists have suggested the same for India. Others have raised fears about excess supply of money leading to inflation. Monetisation of the fiscal deficit directly by India's central bank used to be norm until the mid 1990s. India, Dr Singh said, had moved away from the practice to bring about \"fiscal discipline, institutional separation from the Reserve Bank of India [central bank] and the government and to curb unhealthy impulses of seemingly free money\". \"I am aware that the traditional fear of high inflation due to excess money supply is perhaps no longer valid in developed nations,\" he said. \"But for countries such as India, other than costs of institutional autonomy of the central bank, unbridled printing of money can have attendant impacts on currency, trade and imported inflation.\" Dr Singh said he was not ruling out printing money to finance the deficit, but \"merely suggesting that let the barrier for that to be very high and use it as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted\". He warned against India following some other nations in becoming more protectionist - imposing high trade barriers duties on imports. India's trade policy over the last three decades had brought \"enormous economic gains to not just the top but across all sections of our population\", he said. As Asia's third largest economy, India today is in a far stronger position today than in the early 1990s. I asked Dr Singh whether these strengths would help India stage a robust recovery after the pandemic ends. \"India's real GDP is 10 times stronger than what it was in 1990, and India had lifted more than 300 million people from poverty since then,\" he said. \"So yes, the Indian economy is intrinsically much stronger now.\" But a significant driver of that growth was India's trade with the rest of the world. The share of global trade in India's GDP increased nearly fivefold in this period. \"India is much more integrated with the rest of the world now,\" Dr Singh said. \"Hence, what happens in the global economy will have a significant impact on India's economy. In this pandemic, the global economy is severely dented and that will be a big cause of concern for India.\" Ultimately, no one yet knows the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, nor how long nations will take to recover from it. But one thing is clear, it has defied the experience of even seasoned economists like Dr Singh. \"The previous crises were macroeconomic crises for which there were proven economic tools,\" he said. \"Now we have an economic crisis caused by an epidemic which has induced fear and uncertainty in society, and monetary policy as an economic tool to counter this crisis is proving to be blunt.\"",

The country's birth rate has been falling for years - posing a challenge for the world's second-biggest economy. Despite the birth rate falling, a lower death rate meant China's population hit 1.4bn in 2019, inching up from 1.39bn. But the falling birth rate is raising fears of a \"demographic timebomb\" - that is, a smaller working-age population having to support a bigger, retired population. China's birth rate is lower than the US, which stood at 12 per 1,000 people in 2017 (the most recent data available), but higher than Japan's figure of 8. In England and Wales, the birth rate was 11.6 in 2019, compared with 9 in Scotland. In Northern Ireland the figure was 12.1 in 2018 (the most recent data available). The overall global birth rate was 18.65 in 2017, according to the World Bank. In 1979, the Chinese government introduced a nationwide \"one-child policy\" - with various exceptions - to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. But the policy has been blamed for a severe gender imbalance - with males still outnumbering females by more than 30 million in the 2019 figures. In 2015, the government ended its one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children. But that reform has failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate - despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Experts say this is because the relaxing of the policy did not come with other relevant changes that support family life - such as monetary support for child care and increased paternity leave.

Infection link In an earlier report it found that cases of leukaemia were more likely among wealthier families in the least overcrowded conditions. Other studies have suggested that babies who have regular contact with other children are less likely to develop leukaemia, perhaps because their immune system is primed by early contact with infections. Professor Alex Elliott from the University of Glasgow, who chaired the committee, said \"We should not be complacent about this issue, but we think the government should be looking for other causes beyond radiation for childhood leukaemia cases.\" The committee will now examine clusters of leukaemia cases previously identified around the Sellafield reprocessing plant and Dounreay research facility - these were not included in the current report which focussed only on power plants.",

Announcing his latest move, Mr Gates said the company would \"always be an important part of my life's work\" and he would continue to be engaged with its leadership. But he said: \"I am looking forward to this next phase as an opportunity to maintain the friendships and partnerships that have meant the most to me, continue to contribute to two companies of which I am incredibly proud, and effectively prioritise my commitment to addressing some of the world's toughest challenges.\" Mr Gates is listed by Forbes as the world's second richest man after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and is worth $103.6bn (£84.4bn). He made his fortune developing software for the personal computer. More on Bill Gates: As a young man, he dropped out of college and moved to Albuquerque, in New Mexico, where he set up Microsoft with his childhood friend, Paul Allen, who died in 2018. Their big break came in 1980 when Microsoft signed an agreement with IBM to build the operating system that became known as MS-DOS. Microsoft went public in 1986 and within a year Bill Gates, at the age of 31, had become the youngest self-made billionaire. Mr Gates has served on Berkshire's board since 2004 but devotes much of his time to the charitable organisation he set up with his wife, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The couple were named the most generous philanthropists in the US in 2018 by the The Chronicle of Philanthropy, after giving $4.8bn to their foundation the previous year.",

    "text": "National Security Adviser John Bolton said the administration was acting \"in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\". The deployment of the warship was based on claims of a possible attack on US forces stationed in the region, unnamed US officials are quoted as saying. Mr Bolton added that they would counter any attack with \"unrelenting force\". In a statement, Mr Bolton said: \"The United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the US Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakeable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\" He added: \"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime. But we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or regular Iranian forces.\" The ship was already in Europe for war games with US allies that have been taking place since the end of April. Preparing for war? So far there is little detail from the Americans of the alleged Iranian actions that have prompted this warning nor of the specific US deployments under way. It is not unusual for an aircraft carrier and its battle group to be sent to the Gulf. Reinforcing US land-based air assets in the region, albeit temporarily, is less routine. Washington has itself been turning up the pressure on Iran over recent months; designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist entity; toughening up oil sanctions and so on. But the Trump administration's goal is unclear. Its spokesmen insist that they do not want war with Iran but they can also barely hide their enthusiasm for regime change in Tehran. So is this US move an attempt to guarantee the existing, uneasy status quo ? Or is it an attempt to turn the screw even tighter? Many critics of the administration fear a developing drumbeat towards a conflict which, they fear, could erupt either by accident or by design. The deployment comes amid growing tensions between the US and Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on a trip to Europe: \"It is absolutely the case that we have seen escalatory actions from the Iranians and it is equally the case that we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests.\" He did not explain what he meant by \"escalatory actions\", however he added: \"We have good reason to want to communicate clearly about how the Iranians should understand how we will respond to actions they may take.\" What's the state of relations between America and Iran? Last year President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal the US and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. And last month the White House said it would end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. At the same time the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter Its new hardware is designed to offer superior graphics as well as new social features including the sharing of recorded gameplay clips. It will succeed the PlayStation 3, which went on sale in 2006 and has sold about 75 million units. The PS4 will eventually compete against Microsoft's still-to-be-unveiled Xbox 360 successor and Nintendo's Wii U. Sony also confirmed a range of big-name software for the machine including Bungie's upcoming \"shared-world shooter\" Destiny, which will include exclusive content for the PS4. The developer's previous title, Halo, helped drive sales for the rival Xbox platform. A successful launch might spur on sales of Sony's new televisions and other consumer electronics, helping turn around its fortunes. Sony posted a 456.7bn yen loss ($4.9bn; £3.2bn) in its last financial year, marking the fourth year it ended in deficit. But the firm has forecast a 20bn yen profit for the current financial year ending in March. Sony said the console was \"coming holiday 2013\" suggesting it will go on sale in at least some countries in or around December. It did not give any indication of its price nor did it show what the console would look like. There was also no mention of whether the console would support 4K - or ultra-high definition - video. However, Sony told the BBC it would have more to say on this matter \"at the appropriate moment\". PC-based chip Sony described the machine as being like a \"supercharged\" PC. It runs off an x86-based CPU (central processing unit) - similar architecture to that found in most desktop computers - and an \"enhanced\" PC GPU (graphics processing unit). Both CPU and GPU are designed by the US firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It comes with the new DualShock 4 controller, which includes a touchpad, a \"share button\" and a lightbar, which allows a separate camera to track its movement. \"This is a complete controller upgrade with touch, share and better responsiveness,\" said Brian Blau, an analyst at the tech consultancy Gartner. \"The new controller is the key to a better PS4 experience. It has the ability to share content easily, and brings in a component of touch that allows even more ways to interact with games.\" The console also includes new hardware dedicated to video compression to make it a more social device. Users will be able to pause a game, select a few minutes of recorded video of their most recent activity, and instruct the clip to be uploaded to a social network. This will then occur in the background while they can return to their game. The firm said it wanted to make sharing video clips as common as it is today to share screenshots. Another new feature is that gamers can let one of their friends connect to their machine and take control of their character to help if they have got stuck, or allow several friends to watch their live progress as spectators. This facility uses technology from Gaikai - a cloud-based service Sony acquired last year for $380m. Gaikai's technology is also being used to allow PS4 games to be streamed and played via the PlayStation Vita handheld console, which may boost its sales. Sony said it was also exploring the possibility of using its Gaikai unit to allow PlayStation 3 games to be played on the new machine as well as other devices. However, at the moment PS3 games will not run on the new console. \"The decision to not make the PlayStation 4 backwards compatible is disappointing and means the 5.5 million plus people who own a PS3 in the UK will essentially have to start their gaming collection from scratch,\" said Alex Simmons, UK editor-in-chief of the gaming site IGN. \"PlayStation 3 games - and indeed PSone and PS2 games - will be available to download at some point, but most likely at an additional cost, which might turn consumers off.\" Designed for developers Sony invited developers on stage to preview some of the PS4 games being worked on. They included Killzone Shadowfall - an addition to its bestselling Killzone science fiction first-person shooter series; the racing game Driveclub; superhero game Infamous: Second Son; and Diablo 3. Developer Ubisoft also confirmed that its much-discussed title WatchDogs, which involves a hacker taking control of a smart city's systems, is indeed being developed for the PS4. Jim Ryan, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, told the BBC that his firm's shift to an x86-based processor would make it easier for other developers to create games for the platform. \"One of the fundamental design principles was to make the PlayStation 4 considerably easier to develop for than some of its predecessor platforms,\" he said. \"It is much more of a generic PC environment. It's not a bespoke development environment as was very much the case with the PlayStation 3. \"So it's something developers are aware of, are comfortable with and they don't have to relearn the rules.\" Improved graphics While the graphics shown during the demonstrations were more advanced that those in current games for Nintendo's Wii U, Sony must also convince gamers to choose its platform over PC-based systems. PCs will be capable of offering increasingly impressive visuals as the PS4 ages thanks to their ability to have their processors and other hardware upgraded. US firm Valve, in particular, has been vocal about its ambition to bring PC-based gaming to living room TVs. Even so, Stephen Totilo, editor of the gaming site Kotaku, was broadly impressed with what he had seen. \"The PS4 games we saw today don't look that much better than the best beauties on the PS3 - until you look for the smaller details,\" he said. \"It seems like you can see further into the distance in these games' worlds. More sparks fly, more smoke swirls. \"This is nice, but it has the feeling of the spectacle of visuals alone is reaching a point of diminishing returns. \"More impressive is how much more social the PS4 seems - to be able to capture video of what you play while you play and share that with people brings console gaming closer to the cutting edge of modern gaming on a PC. \"This system seems smarter and more connected - it doesn't seem like a dinosaur.\" How much? Sony did not announce how much it plans to charge - perhaps holding the news back for the E3 gaming conference in Los Angeles in June or a later announcement. The PlayStation 3 was initially sold at a loss, so if that practice is repeated with the new model its launch may initially put fresh strain on the firm's finances. Even so, one analyst suggested that Sony would be willing to take the pain to maximise early demand. \"Without the established user base and community of PS3 and PlayStation Network, Sony would be without a significant home entertainment foothold allowing it to connect many of its other consumer electronic devices, products and services,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Screen Digest. \"Sony's next generation device is likely to take on more importance not less.\" The Japanese firm's shares closed 1.8% lower in Tokyo trade following the announcement.",

A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said: \"The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother.\" They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission. Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12. The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white \"Elvis\" Catherine Walker dress. The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s. Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago. The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos. It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.",

    "text": "By Aamir Rafiq PeerzedaBihar, India One social enterprise in one of India's poorest areas is taking on the challenge of building public toilets. It is using the waste from the toilets to help pay for their upkeep. More than half a billion people in rural India do not use toilets. It's a situation which leads to a host of health and social problems, including children not going to school and women being assaulted or fearing assault when they go to secluded areas to relieve themselves. Alongside official efforts social entrepreneurs, like the team behind Shri or Sanitation and Health Rights in India, are coming up with some inventive proposals. Upkeep payments When Prabin Kumar, one of the founders of Shri, was at school he would often be late because he had to walk more than a kilometre to get to the river to defecate. Today he's one of three social entrepreneurs building toilets in Bihar state in north east India that communities can use for free. Many of the state-run toilets have encountered problems when it comes to clearing the waste and paying for maintenance and upkeep. Instead of clearing the waste, Shri toilets channel it into a biodigester. The biodigester then provides electricity which powers a pump for ground water. This is put through a filtration process at the facility and the filtered water is then bottled and sold for half a rupee (£0.01) a litre. The money from the water pays for the maintenance and upkeep of the toilets. Shri currently sells 3,000 litres of filtered water a day. Community toilets Prabin Kumar and fellow founder Chandan Kumar met Canadian-born engineer Anoop Jain in 2010. Four years later they built their first community toilet in the village of Nemua in the Supaul district of Bihar state. The facility contained eight toilets for men and eight for women. The facilities open at four in the morning and close at ten at night. The team have so far built toilets in five villages, each of which they say is used around 800 times a day. They estimate that each facility has a start-up cost of around $30,000, but the sales of the filtered water mean that once built the facilities then pay for themselves. \"We choose villages where there is no government facility yet,\" Chandan Kumar explains. Before building starts they run an awareness campaign in the village. This is because the barriers to people changing their sanitation habits are often cultural - not just because the facilities have not been available.

Enterprising visions \"We really count on entrepreneurs to provide innovation,\" says Nicolas Osbert from Unicef, India. \"They have the thinking to create new ways of doing business, new ways of addressing sanitation both on the technical side but also on the promotional side.\" Yet Mr Osbert says that while ideas like the biodigester are interesting, he wonders if it could prevent the project expanding on a large scale. However, the Shri team have big ambitions. \"Our plan is to work closely with the government to scale our intervention,\" says Mr Jain. \"We would like to get funds from the government for construction of more facility centres. \"Our facilities will be managed and operated by communities, and Shri will ensure that they are being used and well maintained.\" His co-founder Chandan Kumar agrees: \"We want to see ourselves in a position where our initiative helps our society to become 100% open defecation-free.\"",

    "text": "By Rebecca MorelleScience correspondent, BBC News Scientists have found that when gusts of high-speed solar particles enter our atmosphere, the number of lightning bolts increases. The research is published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Because solar activity is closely monitored by satellites, it may now be possible to forecast when these hazardous storms will hit. Lead researcher Dr Chris Scott, from the University of Reading, said: \"Lightning represents a significant hazard. \"There's something like 24,000 people struck by lightning each year, so having any understanding or advanced warning of the severity of lightning storms has to be useful.\" As the Sun rotates, the fiery ball of plasma hurls out charged particles that travel at between 400-800km a second (900,000 to 1.8 million miles per hour). The arrival of these solar winds in the atmosphere can trigger displays of the Northern Lights, but this research shows how they could influence our weather too. \"The solar wind is not continuous, it has slow and fast streams. Because the Sun rotates, these streams can be sent out behind each other - so if you have a fast solar wind catching up with a slow solar wind, it causes a concentration to occur,\" said Dr Scott. The scientists found that when the speed and intensity of the solar winds increased, so too did the rate of lightning strikes. The team said the turbulent weather lasted for more than a month after the particles hit the Earth. Using data from northern Europe, the researchers found there was an average of 422 lightning strikes in the 40 days after the high-speed solar wind arrived, compared with 321 strikes in the 40 days prior. The finding was surprising, said Dr Scott, because it had been thought that an increase in the solar wind would have the opposite effect. He explained: \"It's unexpected, because these streams of particles bring with them an enhanced magnetic field - and this shields Earth from the very high-energy cosmic rays from outside of the Solar System - these are generated when supernovae explode, and they accelerate particles up to the speed of light.\" Previous research has shown that cosmic rays from space can boost the rate of lightning, and it had been thought that an increased shielding effect from the solar particles would cause a decrease in the number of strikes. \"Instead what we actually saw was a marked increase in lightning. It turns out these solar winds bring with them a slightly lower energy population of particle - and these are enhancing the lighting rate,\" Dr Scott said. The team is not exactly sure of the mechanism, but said that the particles may be penetrating storm clouds, making it easier for them to discharge electrical energy as a bolts of lightning. \"What we need to do now is to track these energetic particles down through the atmosphere, to see if we can see where they end up,\" said Dr Scott. \"We know these particles aren't energetic enough to reach the ground, so they must be stopped somewhere in the lower atmosphere, and we need to know where this is.\" However, while the questions of how still need to be answered, there is plenty of information about when the particles arrive, which could help with storm forecasting. \"These solar wind streams are very predictable. We know the Sun rotates every 27 days, so there is a very strong recurrence rate. If we see them at one time, we know 27 days later it will be back again,\" said Dr Scott. While the data was collected in Europe, the researchers believe the effect is global. Follow Rebecca on Twitter",

He pointed to a badge, but it allegedly belonged to an operations manager who reported it missing in October. Police say Mr Singh arrived on a flight from Los Angeles to O'Hare International Airport on 19 October. He reportedly found the staff badge in the airport and was \"scared to go home due to Covid\", Assistant State Attorney Kathleen Hagerty said, according to the Chicago Tribune.

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It is 6.1mm (0.24in) thick, and also gains a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It has an anti-reflective coating on the screen for the first time, and the A8X - a faster version of the processor featured in the firm's latest iPhones. However, some analysts have questioned whether the upgrade will be enough to turn around iPad sales. An upgraded version of the firm's smaller tablet - called the iPad Mini 3 - was also announced. Like its bigger sibling, it gets the company's fingerprint recognition component. But it uses the older A7 processor and has a lower-resolution rear camera. Some of the details were published by Apple, reportedly by mistake, on Wednesday. Apple's last earnings release revealed that it had sold 13.3 million iPads in the April-to-June quarter. That marked a 9% fall on its tally for the same period in 2013, despite the fact the company saw sales of iPhones and Mac computers rise. It also contrasted with an 11% rise in the number of tablet shipments across the market as a whole - with Lenovo and Asus making some of the biggest gains - according to data from IDC. The market research firm said that the iPad remained the bestselling tablet brand, but that its market share had dropped over the year from 33% to 26.9%. Cannibalised sales? One expert suggested that the recent launch of the 5.5in (14cm)-screened iPhone 6 Plus, which shares most of the new iPads' features, could further temper demand. \"Given that Apple's launched larger iPhones, it needs to find a market that the iPad Mini fits into,\" said Jitesh Ubrani from IDC. \"It was a response to the market as a whole moving to smaller tablets. And now that phablets are growing in not just screen size but also in market size, unless Apple carves out a special place for it, we expect sales of the Mini in particular to be cannibalised quite a bit.\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has told investors he still believes that the tablet market will eventually surpass that of PCs, and has pointed to a recent deal with IBM - involving the two firms co-developing business-centric apps - as a way to get iPad sales on \"a faster trajectory\". Mr Ubrani agreed that targeting businesses had huge potential, but warned that sales to consumers would remain a challenge. \"People who have the old iPad 2 or more recent versions are still happy with these devices - they are still functioning perfectly fine,\" he said. \"There's really no reason to upgrade.\" Other new features of the iPad Air 2 include an eight megapixel rear camera that can now capture slow-mo videos at 120 frames per second. The front camera has also been upgraded to allow in more light and take a rapid succession of selfies. In addition, the machine includes a new type of wi-fi chip that supports faster data speeds, including downloads at up to 866 megabits per second (Mbps). \"It is disappointing - particularly to enterprise buyers - that there wasn't a 12.9in [32.8cm] iPad model,\" said JP Gownder from research firm Forrester, who otherwise praised the update. \"In order to return iPad to high growth, form factor innovation will be required.\" The new tablets will become available to buy next week at similar prices to before. New iMacs Apple also introduced a new model of its all-in-one iMac computer featuring what it said was the highest resolution display on the market. The computer has a 27in (68.6cm) screen that has a resolution of 5K - 5210 by 2880 pixels - offering about five times the detail of a \"full HD\" 1080p television. That represents four times the number of pixels found in the standard iMac of the same size. The basic model will cost $2,499 (£1,555) and is already available for sale. Lenovo already sells the N308 - an all-in-one Android-powered desktop PC with a 19.5in (49.5cm) screen offering slightly lower 4K resolution, while Panasonic has the Toughpad MB5025 - a 20in (50.8cm) 4K computer that runs Windows 8. Intel and Samsung have also announced plans to manufacture 4K screens for other all-in-one PCs. Otherwise, large ultra-high definition display are still a rarity in the computing sector beyond the use of separate monitors, which may aid demand for the new computer. \"There is a huge difference in quality once you start moving through the different sets of screens,\" remarked Ranjit Atwal, research director at the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Given the amount of consumption people are doing of online video, and the quality of what they can get from services like YouTube and Netflix on 4K TVs, they want to see that replicated on a PC as well.\" Apple suggested that people doing visual productivity tasks, such as photo editing, would also benefit from the innovation. Apple also announced an upgraded version of its screenless computer, the Mac Mini, but there was no mention of an update to its Apple TV set top box, which last received a hardware refresh in March 2012. The company also said that the latest version of its operating system for Mac computers - OS X Yosemite - was being made available for download this Thursday. The software allows data to be swapped back and forth with iOS-powered iPhones and iPads more easily than before. Its user interface has also been designed with higher resolution screens in mind. The company added that version 8.1 of iOS, which introduces support for its near field communication (NFC)-powered payment service Apple Pay, would be released on Monday.",

    "text": "He was freed after a financial settlement was approved by the state prosecutor, an official said. Prince Alwaleed was held in November by a new anti-corruption body headed by the Saudi crown prince. More than 200 princes, politicians, and wealthy businessmen were detained in the crackdown. Since then, they have been held in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, which is due to reopen on 14 February. Prince Alwaleed is the most high-profile detainee to have been released so far. Speaking to Reuters news agency before his release he said that no charges had been laid against him and expressed support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The multi-billionaire has a vast array of business interests across the world, including holdings in Twitter and Apple. In November, Forbes estimated his net worth at about $17bn (£13bn), making him the 45th richest man in the world. Officials say he will remain as head of his company, Kingdom Holding. Other high-profile figures that have been set free include Waleed al-Ibrahim, the head of MBC television network, and Khalid al-Tuwaijiri, a former chief of the royal court. They have paid substantial financial settlements, reports say - though the amounts have not been made public. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was released at the end of November, paid more than $1bn (£750m). Media reports suggest that Mr al-Ibrahim's deal may have included his controlling share in MBC - the largest media company in the Middle East. The anti-corruption drive was instigated by Prince Mohammed bin Salman - who has been accused of using the investigation to remove opponents and consolidate his power. In the aftermath of the purge, Saudi Arabia's attorney general said at least $100bn (£76bn) had been misused through systemic corruption and embezzlement going back decades. The detentions - and the expensive settlements - are being characterised by the state as an attempt to recover those funds. Many more of those detained remain in the Ritz Carlton under guard, until it reopens for Valentine's Day in mid-February. Those who do not reach settlements before then are expected to be sent to prison to await trial.",

    "text": "The aircraft, resembling a miniature space shuttle and known as the Orbital Test Vehicle or X-37B, spent 674 days in orbit around the planet. It was the unmanned plane's third space flight, but its mission has been shrouded in mystery. A theory that it was taking a look at China's space lab has been downplayed by experts. Air Force officials have only told US media the aircraft performs \"risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies\". The X-37B programme, started in 1999 and is currently run by the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. The first plane flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. The second launched in March 2011 and remained in space for 15 months. The current aircraft - built by Boeing - uses solar panels for power in orbit, measures over 29ft (9m) long, has a wingspan of nearly 15ft and a weight of 11,000lbs (4,989 kg). It looks like a mini space shuttle and can glide back down through the atmosphere to land on a runway, just like Nasa's re-usable manned spaceplane used to do before its retirement. A fourth X-37B mission is said to be planned for launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2015. Europe is to test its own automated space plane technology in the coming weeks. The IXV vehicle will be launched into space atop a rocket from French Guiana and then make its way back through the atmosphere to splash down in the ocean. BBC News science correspondent Jonathan Amos The reality is that no-one really knows what this vehicle does. The only credible explanation I have seen is that it is testing technologies that could find their way on to future satellite missions. If you consider how expensive a satellite mission is - several hundred million dollars - you'd like to be sure that any innovations are going to work straight out of the box. By flying early prototypes on the X-37B, you can test these technologies so that when you put them on future satellite missions, you can be sure they will deliver. Nasa recently agreed to give over work space formerly used to service the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center to the X-37B programme, which tells us this is a long-term project for the Air Force. Whatever it is they are doing up there, they deem it to be high value.",

    "text": "Including its access roads, the bridge spans 55km (34 miles) and connects Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai. The bridge cost about $20bn (£15.3bn) and should have opened in 2016. Construction has been dogged by safety issues - at least 18 workers have died on the project, officials say. Mr Xi attended the opening ceremony of the bridge, which took place in Zhuhai, along with the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau. Limited bus services begin on Wednesday. What's so special about this bridge? Designed to withstand earthquakes and typhoons, it was built using 400,000 tonnes of steel, enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers. About 30km of its total length crosses the sea of the Pearl River delta. To allow ships through, a 6.7km section in the middle dips into an undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands. The remaining sections are link roads, viaducts and land tunnels connecting Zhuhai and Hong Kong to the main bridge. Why has it been built? It is part of China's plan to create a Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in southern China. The area is currently home to 68 million people. In the past, travelling between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would take up to four hours - the new bridge cuts this down to 30 minutes. Can anyone drive across the bridge? No. Those who want to cross the bridge must obtain special permits, allocated by a quota system. And all vehicles will pay a toll. The bridge is not served by public transport, so private shuttle buses will ply the route. There is no rail link. Authorities initially estimated that 9,200 vehicles would cross the bridge every day. They later lowered their estimations after new transport networks were built in the region. What are people saying about it? There's been a great deal of criticism of the project. It has been dubbed the \"bridge of death\" by some local media. At least nine workers on the Hong Kong side have died and officials told BBC News Chinese that nine had died on the mainland side, too. Hundreds of workers have also been injured during the construction. It's fitted with 'yawn cams'? Special cameras will be on the look-out for drivers on the bridge who show signs of getting sleepy, among other checks - yawn three times and the authorities will be alerted, local media report. To help counter potential terror attacks, there will also be \"48 high-definition surveillance cameras\" mounted at intervals along the bridge as well as anti-terror police patrols, the South China Morning Post reports. And drivers will have to change which side of the road they are on at the crossing. People drive on the left in Hong Kong and Macau but the bridge is Chinese territory and special merger channels have been built to cope with this. You might also be interested in: There have also been concerns about the environmental impact. Environmental groups say the project may have caused serious harm to marine life in the area, including the critically rare Chinese white dolphin. The number of dolphins seen in Hong Kong waters has decreased from 148 to 47 in the past 10 years and they are now absent from the waters near the bridge, according to the Hong Kong branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). \"The project has made irreversible damage to the sea,\" said Samantha Lee, Assistant Director of Ocean Conservation at the WWF. \"I am worried that the number will never rise again.\" Is it going to recoup its costs? The bridge, surrounding link roads and artificial islands cost a staggering $20bn to build - the main bridge alone cost $6.92bn. Chinese officials say it will generate up to 10 trillion yuan ($1.44tn; £1tn) for the economy, but one Hong Kong lawmaker cast doubt on that figure. \"I am not so sure either how the bridge can sustain itself if not many cars are using it,\" Tanya Chan told BBC News Chinese. \"I am pretty sure that we would never earn that [construction cost] back.\" According to an estimate by BBC Chinese, the bridge will only earn around $86m in tolls per year. In fact, the bridge's maintenance costs would already take away a third of this income. Critics have called the bridge a \"big white elephant\" that guarantees no economic return. Others have said its main purpose is symbolic, ensuring Hong Kong is physically connected to the mainland. Additional reporting by Lam Cho Wai, BBC Chinese.",

    "text": "By The Visual and Data Journalism TeamBBC News The northern states of Roraima, Acre, Rondônia and Amazonas have been particularly badly affected. Huge fires have also been burning across the border in Bolivia, devastating swaths of the country's tropical forest and savannah. So what's happening exactly and how bad are the fires? There have been a lot of fires this year Brazil - home to more than half the Amazon rainforest - has seen a high number of fires in 2019, Brazilian space agency data suggests. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) says its satellite data shows an 76% increase on the same period in 2018. The official figures show more than 87,000 forest fires were recorded in Brazil in the first eight months of the year - the highest number since 2010. That compares with 49,000 in the same period in 2018. Nasa, which provides Inpe with its active fire data, confirmed recordings from its satellite sensors also indicated 2019 had been the most active year for almost a decade. However, 2019 is not the worst year in recent history. Brazil experienced more fire activity in the 2000s - with 2005 seeing more than 142,000 fires in the first eight months of the year. Forest fires are common in the Amazon during the dry season, which runs from July to October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, such as lightning strikes, but this year most are believed to have been started by farmers and loggers clearing land for crops or grazing. There had been a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon, said Douglas Morton, head of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center. The timing and location of the fires were more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought, he added. Activists say the anti-environment rhetoric of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has encouraged such tree-clearing activities since he came into power in January. In response to criticism at home and abroad, Mr Bolsonaro announced he was banning setting fires to clear land for 60 days. The president has also accepted an offer of four planes to fight the fires from the Chilean government and has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. However, he has refused a G7 offer of $22m (£18m) following a dispute with French President Emmanuel Macron. The north of Brazil has been badly affected Most of the worst-affected regions are in the north of the country. Roraima, Acre, Rondônia and Amazonas all saw a large percentage increase in fires when compared with the average across the last four years (2015-2018). Roraima saw a 141% increase, Acre 138%, Rondônia 115% and Amazonas 81%. Mato Grosso do Sul, further south, saw a 114% increase. Amazonas, the largest state in Brazil, has declared a state of emergency. Deliberate deforestation? The recent increase in the number of fires in the Amazon is directly related to intentional deforestation and not the result of an extremely dry season, according to the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam). Ipam's director Ane Alencar said fires were often used as a way of clearing land for cattle ranches after deforesting operations. \"They cut the trees, leave the wood to dry and later put fire to it, so that the ashes can fertilise the soil,\" she told the Mongabay website. While the exact scale of deforestation in the rainforest will only be certain when 2019 figures are published at the end of the year, preliminary data suggests there has been a significant rise already this year. Monthly data shows the scale of the areas cleared has been creeping up since January, but with a spike in July this year - almost 278% higher than in July 2018, according to Inpe. Inpe tracks suspected deforestation in real-time using satellite data, sending out alerts to flag areas that may have been cleared. More than 10,000 alerts were sent out in July alone. The record number of fires also coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations, BBC analysis has found. The fires are emitting large amounts of smoke and carbon Plumes of smoke from the fires have spread across the Amazon region and beyond. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams), a part of the European Union's Earth observation programme, the smoke has been travelling as far as the Atlantic coast. The fires have been releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of 228 megatonnes so far this year, according to Cams, the highest since 2010. They are also emitting carbon monoxide - a gas released when wood is burned and does not have much access to oxygen. Maps from Cams show this carbon monoxide - a pollutant that is toxic at high levels - being carried beyond South America's coastlines. The Amazon basin - home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people - is crucial to regulating global warming, with its forests absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. But when trees are cut or burned, the carbon they are storing is released into the atmosphere and the rainforest's capacity to absorb carbon is reduced. There were more fires in the mid-2000s While the number of fires in Brazil is at its highest level for almost a decade, the data suggests that Brazil - and the wider Amazon region - has experienced more intense burning in the past. An analysis of Nasa satellite data this month indicated that the total fire activity in 2019 across the Amazon, not just Brazil, is close to the average when compared with a longer 15 year period. Figures from Brazil's Inpe, dating back to 1998, also show the country suffered worse periods of fire activity in the 2000s. Reports in mid-August, including on the BBC, had said there were a record number of fires in Brazil this year. Inpe has since made more data easily accessible, showing how far back its records stretched. We have now amended our reports to reflect this information. Inpe's historic figures are backed by numbers from Cams, which show total CO2 equivalent emissions - used to measure of the amount and intensity of fire activity - were also higher in Brazil the mid-2000s. Other countries have also been affected A number of other countries in the Amazon basin - an area spanning 7.4m sq km (2.9m sq miles) - have also seen a high number of fires this year. Venezuela has experienced the second-highest number, with more than 26,000 fires, with Bolivia coming in third, with more than 19,000. This is a rise of 79% on last year. Peru, in fifth place, has seen a rise of 92%. The size of the fires in Bolivia is estimated to have doubled since late last week. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles - are affected. Bolivia has hired a Boeing 747 \"supertanker\" from the US to drop water, and accepted an offer of aid from G7 leaders. Extra emergency workers have also been sent to the region, and sanctuaries are being set up for animals escaping the flames. South American countries are planning to meet in the Colombian city of Leticia next week to discuss a co-ordinated response to the fires.

Syrian officials and activists said on Sunday that it had been blown up. The UN's cultural organisation said the deliberate destruction of Syria's cultural heritage was a war crime. Unesco's director-general, Irina Bokova, accused IS of seeking to \"deprive the Syrian people of its knowledge, its identity and history\". She also expressed outrage at the beheading last week of Khaled al-Asaad, the retired chief archaeologist at Palmyra, who refused to co-operate with IS. Pile of rubble The Temple of Baalshamin was built nearly 2,000 years ago and was considered the second most important structure at Palmyra - the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world. Syria's director of antiquities, Maamoun Abdul Karim, said IS militants had packed the Graeco-Roman temple with large quantities of explosives and detonated them on Sunday, bringing down the inner sanctum, or cella, and surrounding pillars. Three of the images published online on Tuesday appear to show men placing barrels of explosives connected with detonating cord around the temple's interior and on several exterior columns. Another image shows a large explosion and plume of smoke, and a fifth shows the aftermath, with piles of rubble where the temple used to be. Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra One caption reads: \"The complete destruction of the pagan Baalshamin temple.\" The images could not be independently verified, but they carried a logo IS often uses for propaganda from Palmyra, which the group captured from Syrian government forces in May. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that the temple was destroyed a month ago. IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq, seeing them as symbols of \"idolatry\". Until the temple was brought down, they had only demolished a statue of a lion from Palmyra, though they used the site's theatre to stage the public execution by children of more than 20 captured Syrian army soldiers.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent The drive to sterilise began in the 1970s when, encouraged by loans amounting to tens of millions of dollars from the World Bank, the Swedish International Development Authority and the UN Population Fund, India embarked on an ambitious population control programme. During the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - Sanjay Gandhi, son of the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, began what was described by many as a \"gruesome campaign\" to sterilise poor men. There were reports of police cordoning off villages and virtually dragging the men to surgery. The campaign also made an appearance in Salman Rushdie's novel, Midnight's Children. An astonishing 6.2 million Indian men were sterilised in just a year, which was \"15 times the number of people sterilised by the Nazis\", according to science journalist Mara Hvistendahl. Two thousand men died from botched operations. \"India has a dark history of state-sponsored population control, often with eugenic aims - targeting the poor and underprivileged,\" Ms Hvistendahl told me. \"The women's tragic deaths [in Chhattisgarh] show that it still happens today.\" Since family planning efforts began in the 1970s, India has focused its population control efforts on women, even though, as scientists say, sterilisations are easier to perform in men. \"This may be because women are deemed less likely to protest,\" says Ms Hvistendahl. India carried out nearly 4 million sterilisations during 2013-2014, according to official figures. Less than 100,000 of these surgeries were done on men. More than 700 deaths were reported due to botched surgeries between 2009 and 2012. There were 356 reported cases of complications arising out of the surgeries. Though the government has adopted a raft of measures and standards for conducting safe sterilisations, an unseemly haste to meet high state-mandated quotas has often led to botched operations and deaths. Women have died from forced sterilisations in China where population control was institutionalised since the 1980s. \"But the conditions in Indian sterilisation camps sound worse,\" says Ms Hvistendahl. There have been reports of the appalling quality of tubectomies for many years now, and authorities still don't seem to realise that it is an important reproductive health concern. And the shoddy surgeries continue, risking the lives of poor women.",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website Their conclusions, published in the journal Nature, were made by analysing decades of data on human longevity. They said a rare few may live longer, but the odds were so poor you'd have to scour 10,000 planet Earths to find just one 125-year-old. But while some scientists have praised the study, others have labelled it a dismal travesty. Life expectancy has been increasing relentlessly since the nineteenth century - due to vaccines, safer childbirth and tackling killers like cancer and heart disease. But can that go on forever? The team in New York analysed data from the Human Mortality Database and the deaths of super-centenarians (those over 110) in France, Japan, UK and US. The data showed increases in life expectancy were slowing in centenarians and that the maximum age of death had plateaued for at least two decades. Prof Jan Vijg, one of the researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, told the BBC News website: \"In people over 105 we make very little progress, that tells you we are most likely approaching the limit to human life. \"For the first time in history we've been able to see this, it looks like the maximum life span - this ceiling, this barrier - is about 115. \"It's almost impossible you'll get beyond it. You need 10,000 worlds like ours to end up with one individual in a given year who will live until 125 - so a very small chance.\" The oldest person Jeanne Calment came close. The oldest ever person, whose age can be backed up by official documents, was 122 when she died in 1997. The French icon of longevity was born before the Eiffel Tower was constructed and met the painter Vincent van Gogh. Nobody has since got near her venerable age. Prof Dame Linda Partridge, the director of the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, said a limit to lifespans \"logically has to exist\". But she told the BBC: \"Although this really interesting paper describes what is happening, it doesn't describe what will happen.\" The crop of centenarians in the study were affected by malnutrition and infectious diseases in their childhood back in the late 19th Century. Remember smallpox was declared eradicated only in 1980. \"It was certainly very different to what the current birth cohort will go through, but it could yet be rather negative as a lot of children have grown up obese and that could bring lifespan down quite a lot,\" Prof Partridge added. 'Travesty' The 115-year claim is too much for Prof James Vaupel, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. He described the study as a dismal travesty and said scientists had in the past claimed the limit was 65, 85 and 105 only to be proven wrong over and over again. He said: \"In this sorry saga, those convinced that there are looming limits did not apply demography and statistics to test hypotheses about lifespan limits—instead they exploited rhetoric, deficient methods and pretty graphics to attempt to prove their gut feelings. \"[This study] adds nothing to scientific knowledge about how long we will live.\" Experiments, which look after animals in ideal conditions, have suggested lifespans do have a limit. Prof Jay Olshansky, from the University of Illinois, said mice tend to live for about 1,000 days, dogs for about 5,000 days and \"humanity is approaching a natural limit to life\". Stopping ageing? The challenge with tackling ageing is that we have not evolved to live to extreme old ages. Millions of years of natural selection has honed us to survive, grow and reproduce in our youth. What happens to our bodies half a century or more later - at ages we have never reached in our evolutionary history - are a side-effect of the instructions in our DNA that are important in youth. So any attempt to really increase lifespan will need an approach that goes beyond treating diseases and tackles ageing inside every cell of the body. Prof Jan Vijg added: \"To get maximum life spans of 120, 125 or 130 maybe, we need to do something very fundamental here. \"We need to change the whole genetic make-up of the human species, you would have to develop thousands or tens of thousands of different drugs. \"The ageing process is so complicated that it will not be possible to substantially change this limit to human life.\" Follow James on Twitter.",

    "text": "The hikers were not breathing and their hearts had stopped. The search for a total of 45 missing climbers has now been called off for the night. The volcano, about 200km (125 miles) west of Tokyo, erupted without warning on Saturday, spewing ash and rocks. About 250 people were trapped on the slopes of the popular beauty spot, but most got down safely. Japan is one of the world's most seismically active nations - but there have been no fatalities from volcanic eruptions since 1991, when 43 people died at Mount Unzen in the south-west. First deaths confirmed Saturday's eruption forced many of those on the mountain to make emergency descents through clouds of volcanic ash and falling rocks. \"The volcanic rocks fell like hailstones,\" one man said. \"We couldn't breathe so we covered our mouths with towels. We couldn't open our eyes either.\" Another told reporters: \"The volcanic ash was hurtling so fast I couldn't run away. I'm worried about people still on the mountain.\" Almost 50 people were thought to have stayed on the mountain on Saturday night, reports said. Rescue efforts will resume on Monday after an intense search on Sunday was called off because of toxic volcanic gases in the area. It is understood 45 people are still listed as unaccounted for - including those found near the summit. There are fears that others could be buried under volcanic ash. Four people were transported back down the mountain on Sunday and later confirmed dead, Japan's NHK News reported. Japanese officials can only announce deaths after a formal doctor's examination. Analysis: Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Tokyo The question many people have been asking is - why were there hundreds of people on top of an active volcano? And, why was there no warning it was about to erupt? The answer to the first question is that there are lots of active volcanos in Japan, and people hike on them all the time. I have done so myself. Mount Fuji is classed as an active volcano, and hundreds of thousands of people climb it every year. In some ways the people caught in Saturday's eruption were very unlucky. It was a beautiful sunny Saturday at the peak of the autumn hiking season. Had it been a rainy Wednesday in June the chances are very few people would have been up there. The question of no warning is harder to answer. Volcanologists point out this was a relatively small eruption, and that it was driven by super-heated steam and ash, not by lava being ejected from the magma chamber. That made it much more difficult to predict. But it also meant that many of those caught up in the eruption survived. Had it been a large-scale eruption (like the one in 1979) with large pyroclastic flows, many more would have been killed. Lodge sanctuary The sudden eruption on Saturday was described as \"like thunder\" by one woman who runs a lodge near the summit. Heavy, toxic volcanic ash up to 20cm (8in) thick covered much of the mountain, reports said. \"All of a sudden ash piled up so quickly that we couldn't even open the door,\" Shuichi Mukai, who worked in a mountain lodge just below the peak, told Reuters. \"We were really packed in here, maybe 150 people. There were some children crying, but most people were calm. We waited there in hard hats until they told us it was safe to come down.\" Ordinarily Mount Ontake is a popular place to see autumn foliage. Its peak is 3,067m (10,120ft) high and the mountain is a popular hiking route, dotted with lodges, cabins and well-marked trails.",

However, many countries have so far been reluctant to do so. Why did they want to go to Syria and Iraq? Jihadists began travelling to Iraq in 2003 when a US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime triggered a Sunni insurgency. Hundreds are thought to have joined al-Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor to IS. Many more went to Syria after a civil war erupted there in 2011. Their presence complicated the conflict and helped make it overtly sectarian in nature, pitching the country's Sunni majority against President Bashar al-Assad's Shia Alawite sect. There was a huge surge in arrivals after IS seized control of swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and urged Muslims to migrate to their new \"caliphate\". How many foreigners joined IS? The United Nations has said that more than 40,000 foreign fighters from 110 countries may have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join terrorist groups. A July 2018 study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London based on official, academic and other data concluded that 41,490 people - 32,809 men, 4,761 women, and 4,640 children - from 80 countries were affiliated with IS specifically. Researchers found 18,852 came from the Middle East and North Africa, 7,252 from Eastern Europe, 5,965 from Central Asia, 5,904 from Western Europe, 1,010 from Eastern Asia, 1,063 from South-East Asia, 753 from the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, 447 from Southern Asia, and 244 from Sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 850 people from the UK were among them, including 145 women and 50 children. How many are dead? The US-led Global Coalition to Defeat IS, which has provided air support and military advisers to local forces in Iraq and Syria since 2014, has said it believes the vast majority of IS militants are dead or in custody. But it has declined to speculate on the number of foreign fighters who may have been killed. The head of MI5 said in October 2017 that more than 130 Britons who had travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with IS had died. What about those in custody? An official from a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said on 18 February that it had about 800 foreign fighters from almost 50 countries in its prisons. At least 700 women and 1,500 children were being held at camps for displaced people, Abdul Karim Omar added. Few of the SDF's detainees have been identified. But El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are among six from the UK to have been named. The pair are alleged to have been part of an IS execution cell dubbed \"the Beatles\" that beheaded at least 27 Western hostages. Mr Omar reiterated that the SDF wanted the foreign fighters to be repatriated. He warned that they were a \"time bomb\", saying an attack on northern Syria by Turkey - which has vowed to crush a Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF - could spark chaos and allow the jihadist to escape. However, their home countries have raised concerns about bringing hardened IS members back and the challenges of gathering evidence to support prosecutions. There are believed to be another 1,000 foreign fighters of various, sometimes undetermined, nationalities under arrest in Iraq, according to the UN. It is not clear whether that figure includes women and children. But a group of more than 1,300 of them are known to have been detained near Tal Afar in 2017. Human Rights Watch said at least 72 of those women had been put on trial by June 2018, accused of illegal entry and being a member of, or assisting, IS. Most of them, it added, had been found guilty and sentenced to death or to life in prison. They were from a number of countries, including Turkey, Russia, France and Germany. Children aged nine and above have also been prosecuted. How many foreigners are still fighting? After five years of fierce and bloody battles, Syrian and Iraqi forces, backed by world powers, have driven IS out of almost all of the territory it once controlled. However, UN Secretary General António Guterres told the Security Council at the start of February 2018 that IS was reported to still control between 14,000 and 18,000 militants in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners. Mr Guterres published his findings as the SDF launched an offensive to capture the last pocket of territory controlled by IS in Syria. Foreigners who have fled the fighting around the village of Baghuz and been detained by the SDF include the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS. Have any returned home? ICSR researchers found that at least 7,366 foreigners affiliated with IS had travelled back to their own countries, including 256 women and up to 1,180 children. By June 2018, 3,906 had returned to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, 1,765 to Western Europe, 784 to Eastern Europe, 338 to Central Asia, 308 to South-Eastern Asia, 156 to Southern Asia, 97 to the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, and 12 to Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 425 who returned to the UK, only two women and four children were confirmed, according to the ICSR. The UN has expressed concern about returnees becoming active again on release from prison or for other reasons. It has also said radicalised women and traumatised minors may pose a threat. What's happening to the children? More than 2,000 children of foreign fighters are being detained at prisons in Iraq and at three SDF-run camps in Syria, often in poor conditions with a lack of access to education and basic services. Most of the children are being held with their mothers. Many of their fathers are detained elsewhere, missing or dead. Some of the children have meanwhile been orphaned. The majority of the children have not been charged with any crime, according to Human Rights Watch. But most of their home countries have resisted calls to repatriate them. Officials have said traumatised children may be security threats, or that it is difficult to verify their nationalities. The UN has warned that the children may be at risk of becoming stateless, despite having citizenship or a claim to citizenship of a country. It has called for all children under 18 to be repatriated immediately and for the development of specialised child-protection programmes to ensure their full reintegration into society in their home countries. In January, two Trinidadian boys taken to Syria by their father were released from an SDF camp and repatriated with the help of Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters.",

    "text": "By Abid HussainBBC Urdu, Islamabad The reports emerged after local Pakistani media said troops had kidnapped the provincial police chief to force him to arrest a top opposition leader. The story was quickly picked up over the border in Pakistan's arch-rival, India, where reports went much further - saying clashes between the police and the army had resulted in the deaths of many Karachi police officers and tanks had been seen on the streets. A fake video circulating on Twitter even claimed to show some of the alleged unrest. In reality, none of it was true. Many local police and opposition members had been angered by events surrounding the politician's arrest - but there was no violence. Pakistan and India are bitter enemies and it's well known they have long used propaganda against each other - they have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. Last year, Facebook blocked networks linked to Pakistan's military and a global network of pro-Indian fake websites and think-tanks was exposed, which had been aimed at influencing decision-making in Europe. But what's notable this time is the number of verified accounts and apparently reputable news outlets that ended up putting out news that was utterly false, to millions of followers and readers. 'Fighting' in a place that doesn't exist Tempers seemed to be simmering down when Pakistan's army chief ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest on Tuesday of Safdar Awan, the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A day earlier there had been a major rally against the government of Pakistan's current Prime Minister Imran Khan in Karachi, an opposition stronghold which is the capital of Sindh province. But later on Tuesday night a hitherto unknown account tweeted that a fight between troops and police had broken out, with tanks on the streets of Karachi and at least five casualties. It's unclear who sent this initial tweet. Despite extensive digging by the BBC, it was not possible to establish who operates the Twitter account named @drapr007. An hour later, the account tweeted again, this time saying: \"#BREAKING: Heavy firefight between Pak Army and Sindh Police is going on in Gulshan e Bagh area of #Karachi...\" Those familiar with Karachi would know there is no area there by that name - but most readers would not. Nor had there been any fighting, or tanks seen on the streets. However, news of the \"civil war\" then spread rapidly. A deadly blast in Karachi which turned out to have been caused by a gas leak added fuel to the rumours. They were picked up by verified individuals and major Indian media outlets such as CNN18, Zee News and India Today. One user with a verified account, Prashant Patel - whose bio says is an advocate of the Supreme Court of India - went on to put out a series of tweets where he made claims about a \"civil war situation\" in Karachi, deaths of policemen and soldiers, Prime Minister Imran Khan ordering patriotic songs to be played on the radio, and even the impending arrival of the US Navy in the port of Karachi. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into some of the accounts and websites - some of them impersonating the Sindh police - which have been spreading false news about the situation in Karachi and found them to have links with India. Video purporting to show the clashes was shared by an account under the name of International Herald. The dark and blurry video shows young men walking towards a building with fire visible to one side. They are seen throwing stones and shouting slogans, seemingly against Pakistan's army chief. The BBC was unable to tell if the video had been doctored, or even shot in Pakistan at all. International Herald was registered under a now-defunct Indian company in 2018. It's had a Twitter account since 2015 which does not follow anyone. Its followers include two leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. 'Co-ordinated disinformation' Mainstream Pakistani media outlets were quick to challenge the Indian media claims with fact-checks. And Twitter users in Pakistan have had a field day ridiculing the reports, using hashtags such as \"CivilwarKarachi\", \"fakenews\" and \"Indianmedia\" trending on Twitter along with humorous posts and memes. Renowned singer and actor Fakhr-e-Alam tweeted: \"Karachi civil war has gotten so bad that my food panda delivery boy had to crawl through mine fields carrying his AK47, RPG & 9mm along with my nihari and Biryani. This thing is getting so serious.\" Writer Bina Shah said: \"I live in Karachi, where I just did my groceries, visited the bakery, bought some clothes and came home. If there's a civil war out there I couldn't find it.\" Some called the reports a case of \"co-ordinated disinformation\" by Indian media. 'So biased it does not make sense' Hartosh Singh Bal, political editor of one of India's most respected news magazines The Caravan told the BBC: \"There's a section of media in both countries which is essentially busy playing games, and what they do has little to do with journalism. \"It is so biased that it does not make sense.\" Another senior Indian journalist who did not want to be named said projecting a divide between the army and police in Pakistan would fit into the Indian narrative of a Pakistan in decline. \"A quick study of Twitter handles tweeting this misinformation will show that most of them are supporters of or affiliated to the ruling party.\" Arslan Khalid, who advises Imran Khan on digital strategy, said it was not the first time that Indian media had run a co-ordinated disinformation campaign against Pakistan. He questioned Twitter's commitment to its guidelines. Despite repeated attempts, the BBC was unable to obtain a response from Twitter regarding its policies on fake news. The BBC's Reality Check and BBC Monitoring both contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Police have been granted an extra 24 hours to question lorry driver Mo Robinson, 25, on suspicion of murdering the eight women and 31 men. Three properties in Northern Ireland have been raided and the National Crime Agency is working to establish if \"organised crime groups\" were involved. The trailer arrived in Purfleet on the River Thames from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Ambulance staff discovered the bodies in the container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays just after 01:30 BST on Wednesday. The lorry and trailer left the port at Purfleet shortly after 01:05. Police said the tractor unit - the front part of the lorry - entered the country via Holyhead in Wales on Sunday, having travelled from Dublin. Speaking after a magistrate granted Essex Police more time to question Mr Robinson on Thursday, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said her priority was \"preserving the dignity of the 39 people who have died and ensuring that we get answers for their loved ones\". Councillor Paul Berry said the village of Laurelvale in County Armagh, where the Robinson family live, was in \"complete shock\". He said he had been in contact with Mr Robinson's father, who had learned of his son's arrest on Wednesday through social media. \"The local community is hoping that he [Mo Robinson] has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this,\" he said. The lorry has been moved to a secure site at Tilbury Docks and police are due to begin the process of moving the bodies to a mortuary at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. They will be taken by private ambulance so that post-mortem examinations can take place, with the force expecting all the bodies to have been moved by the weekend. Global Trailer Rentals Ltd confirmed to RTE News that it owned the trailer and said it had leased it on 15 October. The firm said it had given Essex Police the details of the person and company they had leased it to. Essex Police said it was the largest murder investigation in the force's history and the victims were all \"believed to be Chinese nationals\". It said formal identification of the 39 people, one of whom is a young adult woman, \"could be a lengthy process\". China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming tweeted that the embassy had read the reports of the deaths \"with heavy hearts\" and was in close contact with British police. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, said the sheer number of containers coming into the UK every day made it impossible to look inside them all. \"We don't have the facility to check the vast majority of freight which arrives in the UK, whether it moves or not,\" she said. She said disconnected freight containers were less likely to be searched unless there was \"intelligence to the contrary that suggests we need to do that\". Police initially suggested the lorry could be from Bulgaria, but later said officers believed it entered the UK from Belgium. A spokesman for the Bulgarian foreign affairs ministry said the truck was registered in the country under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. The Belgian Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said the container arrived in Zeebrugge at 14:29 on Tuesday and left the port later that afternoon. It was not clear when the victims were placed in the container or if this happened in Belgium, a spokesman said. A spokesman for C.RO Ports, which operates terminals at Purfleet and Zeebrugge, said they would \"fully assist\" the police investigation. Shaun Sawyer, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for modern slavery and human trafficking, said while forces had prevented thousands of deaths, \"tragically, for 39 people that didn't work yesterday\". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme even if there were routes perceived as easier to get through, organised criminals would still exploit people who could not access those. Analysis By Celia Hatton, BBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor When China makes the news headlines, it's often painted as wealthy global power. However, its boom has also fostered extreme inequality, with the top one percent of Chinese citizens holding one-third of the country's riches. That gap is widening: a continuing trade war with the United States has forced many factories to close, disproportionately punishing some of China's poorest workers. Surveys have repeatedly found that China's upper and middle class citizens are eager to leave the mainland, citing worries about the lack of high-quality schooling and health care, and lingering pollution and food safety problems. Poor people in China have the same concerns but they have less opportunity to emigrate overseas. The Chinese government controls who can get a passport and who qualifies for an exit permit. Ever-tightening controls allow people smugglers and human traffickers to prey on those who are desperate to find work. We don't yet know the story behind why the people found on the Essex lorry had taken that journey. A UK government report on modern slavery published one year ago found that China was the third most common foreign country of origin for victims of human trafficking. Police officers and councillors have signed a book of condolences which was opened at Thurrock Council's chambers. A vigil was held at 18:00 outside the Home Office to \"call for urgent action to ensure safe passage\" for people fleeing war and poverty. Thurrock's Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price said there needed to be an international response. \"We have partnerships in place but those efforts need to be rebooted, this is an international criminal world where many gangs are making lots of money and until states act collectively to tackle that it is going to continue,\" she said.

    "text": "By Celestina OlulodeNewsbeat reporter To separate the facts from myths, we've put your questions to health experts. Dr Alex George is an A&E doctor and former Love Island contestant. Alix Fox is a sex journalist, presenter of BBC Radio 1's Unexpected Fluids show, and co-host of The Modern Mann podcast. Is it safe to have sex during the coronavirus outbreak? Dr Alex George: If you're in a relationship… living with that person, and sharing the same environment, it shouldn't change your situation. However if one of you is displaying symptoms of coronavirus then you should maintain your social-distancing and isolate, even within your home. In an ideal world everyone would stay two metres apart - even in their own house, but we realise this may not be realistic. Alix Fox: It's also really important not to assume that if you are experiencing mild symptoms of coronavirus it will be the same for your partner. So, if you're showing any symptoms whatsoever do try and stay away from your lover. What about sex with new people? Dr Alex: I certainly wouldn't advise having new sexual partners at the moment, because the risk is you could pass on the virus. Alix Fox: Don't forget as well, some people who are carriers of the virus won't have any symptoms. So even if you feel absolutely fine… you could still pass on the infection to someone and they could pass it on to other people via close contact and kissing. I kissed someone I recently met, and they've gone on to develop symptoms. What should I do? Dr Alex: If you've kissed or been in contact with someone who you think has gone on to develop coronavirus, make sure you self-isolate. Keep an eye on your symptoms. If you are developing symptoms, then be extra careful. Go online to the nhs.uk website. Only call the 111 service if your symptoms are so bad that you need medical support from us. Alix Fox: We should be responsible with each other, and for ourselves in our relationships. If you're somebody who has developed symptoms, and you know that you've kissed people recently, you should let them know. And even if you've kissed someone and they've got symptoms and you haven't, you should also self-isolate. I wasn't using condoms with my partner before coronavirus, should I start now? Alix Fox: The answer depends on why you weren't using condoms. If you weren't using condoms because you have both been tested for STIs, or you're in a heterosexual relationship prior to menopause and are using another kind of contraception to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, then that's fine. But if you weren't using condoms because you were relying on something like the pull-out method - or you were taking chances with STIs - then it's even more important that you use condoms now. Can I get coronavirus by touching someone else's vagina or penis? Dr Alex: If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva. Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus. We want to cut this back to the absolute minimum. So, no contact between a partner that you're not living with is really important. How can I maintain a relationship at a time like this? I don't want to be single now. Alix Fox: This whole pandemic is prompting a lot of people to rethink what a good sex life is and what constitutes as an enjoyable, pleasurable exchange. I've heard of people writing erotic stories to each other, and people who are dating but quarantined in different places taking advantage of the time and the distance. A lot of people have been getting really creative. If you use your imagination a little bit there are lots of ways you can have a sexy time without being face-to-face with somebody. It's also important to remember that right now… some people might be discovering that they or their partners have different libidos. You might find yourself in a situation where you were only going on a date once a week, and suddenly you're living under the same roof. You might find that you want sex when your partner doesn't, or vice versa. It's important to communicate this in a respectful, compassionate manner. Living together does not mean that you're entitled to sex whenever you want. And for anybody who is in a situation where they're with a partner and they're not having a good time, because they feel like they're being forced into sex, there are helplines available for that. Am I more at risk of catching coronavirus if I have HIV? Alix Fox: Dr Michael Brady at the Terrence Higgins Trust has provided some really great advice on this. If you are already on regular medication to manage HIV, and you have a good CD4 count (number of white blood cells to fight infection) and an undetectable viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) then you're not considered to have a weakened immune system. This means you run no additional risk of contracting coronavirus. So, if you're HIV positive, continue taking your meds as you would do. Make sure that you follow the same rules as everybody else when it comes to things like isolation. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

    "text": "Dozens remain, refusing to believe the authorities' pledge of a safe exit. The tense stand-off follows a day of bloody clashes on Friday in which 173 people died and 1,000 Brotherhood supporters were arrested. The group has called for daily protests after a crackdown on their camps in Cairo on Wednesday left hundreds dead. Meanwhile the interim prime minister has proposed legally dissolving the Brotherhood. The movement is demanding the reinstatement of Mohammed Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - who was removed by the army last month and replaced with an interim government. Also on Saturday, the Muslim Brotherhood said on its Facebook page that Ammar Badie, the son of the movement's spiritual leader, General Guide Mohamed Badie, was one of those killed during protests on Friday. Fear for lives Police have surrounded the al-Fath mosque in Cairo's Ramses Square, where Morsi supporters were holed up. Security forces had earlier entered the building to try to persuade them to go. Television pictures showed the security forces in riot gear on the steps outside, with an angry crowd also in attendance. The security forces did fire into the air to keep the crowd away as some Morsi supporters were escorted from the mosque. But correspondents say dozens more remain in the main hall, refusing to leave. BBC Arabic spoke to two of the protesters inside who said that they feared for their lives. They told the BBC that they did not trust the authorities' promises of a safe exit. They said there were two bodies inside - one of them of a woman who died after tear gas was fired by police into the mosque overnight and another of a man taken into the building after sustaining bullet wounds. They said the protesters had drinking water but there was only one toilet. Among those in the mosque are four Irish citizens - sisters Omaima, Somaia and Fatima Halawa, along with their brother, Ibrihim. Their father is Hussein Halawa, imam of Ireland's largest mosque, in Clonskeagh, Dublin. Some 1,000 people were trapped in the mosque after violence in Ramses Square on Friday. Security officials quoted by the official Mena news agency said \"armed elements\" had opened fire from inside the mosque. The building quickly filled with dead and injured - as well as those fleeing the violence. Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday that 1,004 \"Muslim Brotherhood elements\" had been arrested on Friday, 558 of them in Cairo. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that while peaceful protests and the right to assembly had to be respected, \"evidence does point to some of the violent provocation coming from some of the protesters themselves\". \"People really need to be reminded to put Egypt first, rather than their different positions,\" she said. Meanwhile the Brotherhood said that Ammar Badie, 38, had died of a bullet wound in Ramses Square on Friday. His father has been charged with inciting violence but his whereabouts are unknown. The secretary-general of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Mohammed al-Beltagi, says his 17-year-old daughter, Asmaa, died in earlier protests. 'Day of anger' The Muslim Brotherhood has been on the streets since the army deposed Mr Morsi on 3 July. On Wednesday at least 638 people died when the Brotherhood's two protest camps in Cairo were cleared, a move that sparked international condemnation. Friday's protests - dubbed a \"day of anger\" - were called in response to Wednesday's bloodshed. The violence erupted shortly after midday prayers when thousands of Morsi supporters answered the Brotherhood's call for rallies across Egypt. On Saturday, the government updated the casualty figures from the day's violence, putting the number killed across the country at 173, 95 of them in Cairo. It added that 1,330 people had been wounded. The number of police killed since Wednesday was listed as 57, with 563 wounded. Egypt's interim leaders have imposed a state of emergency, with dusk-to-dawn curfews in the capital and other areas. The interior ministry says police have been authorised to use live ammunition \"within a legal framework\". Correspondents say the atmosphere in Cairo is tense, with many armoured personnel carriers deployed on the streets. The army has blocked off all entrances to Tahrir Square - the focus of demonstrations that led to the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Meanwhile, groups that support the army-backed interim government - the National Salvation Front and Tamarod - are calling for counter-demonstrations in response to the Muslim Brotherhood protests. Mr Morsi is now in custody, accused of murder over a 2011 jailbreak. His period of detention was extended by 30 days on Thursday, state media said.",

    "text": "By Prashant KidambiHistorian By a curious historical irony, a sport that was the exclusive preserve of colonial elite is now the national passion of the formerly colonised. What is equally extraordinary is that India has become world cricket's sole superpower. It is a status much savoured by contemporary Indians, for whom their cricket team is the nation. They regard \"team India\" as a symbol of national unity, and its players a reflection of the country's diversity. Cricket Country \"In this last decade,\" former cricketer Rahul Dravid noted in 2011, \"the Indian team represents, more than ever before, the country we come from - of people from vastly different cultures, who speak different languages, follow different religions, belong to different classes.\" But the link between cricket and the nation was neither natural nor inevitable. It took 12 years and three aborted attempts before the first composite Indian team took to the cricket field in the summer of 1911. And contrary to popular perception - fostered by the hugely successful Hindi film Lagaan - this \"national team\" was constituted by - and not against - empire. A diverse coalition of Indian businessmen, princely aristocrats and publicists, working in tandem with British governors, civil servants, journalists, soldiers, and professional coaches made possible the idea of India on the cricket pitch. Because of this alliance between colonial and local elites, India was represented by a cricket team in imperial Britain more than a hundred summers before Virat Kohli and his men embarked on their campaign for the 2019 ICC World Cup. The magical Ranji The project to construct an \"Indian\" cricket team had a long and tortuous history. The idea was first floated in 1898, following the stunning rise of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji or Ranji, an Indian prince who bewitched Britain and the wider imperial world with his sublime batting. Indian cricket promoters sought to capitalise on Ranji's celebrity in putting together a team. But Ranji, who used his cricketing prestige to become the ruler of Nawanagar, was wary of a project that might raise questions about his nationality and, in particular, his right to represent England on the cricket field. There were some in the English establishment - notably, Lord Harris, the ex-Governor of what was then Bombay - who had never reconciled themselves to Ranji's astonishing cricketing success and continued to regard him as a mere \"bird of passage\". Four years later, a different imperative was at work. Now, Europeans in colonial India, who sought to attract teams from home, collaborated with powerful local elites to create an Indian team that would showcase the country's potential as a cricketing destination. But the venture failed because of fierce divisions between Hindus, Parsis and Muslims over the question of their representation in the proposed team. A subsequent attempt in 1906 met with the same fate as previous failed ventures. The years between 1907 and 1909 saw a wave of \"revolutionary\" violence by young Indians who targeted British officials and their local collaborators. And there were strident calls in Britain to prevent the free movement of Indians into the country. Curious Cast Dismayed by the negative publicity generated by these acts, leading businessmen and public figures, along with prominent Indian princes, sought to revive the project of sending an Indian cricket team to London. This was the historical context within which the first \"all-India\" cricket team took shape. The men who were chosen to represent India on the imperial stage made for an improbable cast of characters. The captain of the team was 19-year old Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, the pleasure-seeking, newly enthroned maharaja of the most powerful Sikh state in India. The rest of the team was selected on the basis of religion: there were six Parsis, five Hindus and three Muslims in the side. But the most remarkable feature of the first Indian cricket team was the presence of two Dalits from what was then Bombay - the Palwankar brothers, Baloo and Shivram, who overcame the resistance of upper-caste Hindus to become top cricketers of their time. The composition of this team shows how in the early 20th Century, cricket took on a range of cultural and political meanings within colonial India. For the Parsis, the cricket field acquired new significance at a time of deepening anxieties about the community's supposed deterioration. As Hindus and Muslims became more competitive on the pitch and elsewhere, Parsis began to fret about their own decline. Among northern India's Muslims too, cricket came to embody a new relationship with the political order established by British rule in the subcontinent. Notably, the game was an integral feature of the one of the most important educational initiatives in colonial India: to forge a new Muslim political identity. Of the four Muslim players named in the first Indian team, three came from Aligarh, whose most well-known institution - the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College - had been established by the social reformer Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan to promote western learning within his community. And finally, cricket also became a prism through which Hindu society was forced to reassess the insidious effects of the caste system. At the heart of these debates was the stirring example of an extraordinary Dalit family, whose cricketing ability and achievements questioned the pernicious system of inequity and exclusion practiced by upper-castes Hindus. For the Palwankars, cricket made their struggle for dignity and justice against discrimination possible. Baloo, in particular, became one of the most well-known public figures among his downtrodden compatriots. He was also the hero of the great BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's Constitution and a Dalit icon. For Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, on the other hand, the imperial game was an important instrument in furthering his political interests. The embattled ruler sought to use his position as captain of the first all-India cricket team to quell growing imperial doubts about his abilities as a ruler. Empire loyalism For the empire loyalists who financed and organised the venture, cricket became a means of promoting a positive image of India and assuring authorities in Britain that the country would remain a loyal part of the British Empire. That was the principal aim of the first all-India cricket tour of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The timing was not a coincidence: it was the year George V was formally crowned king-emperor in London and then travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar. It is salutary to recall this long-forgotten history at a time when cricket in the subcontinent has become the vehicle of a shrill hyper-nationalism that views sport as \"war minus the shooting\".

    "text": "In a video published on 2 September, which has been confirmed as authentic by the US authorities, Mr Sotloff was shown dressed in an orange smock, his hands tied behind his back, kneeling in front of a masked figure holding a knife. He was then beheaded. IS had threatened to kill Mr Sotloff at the end of a video released last month showing fellow American journalist James Foley being murdered. US President Barack Obama denounced Mr Sotloff's murder as \"a horrific act of violence\" and insisted that the he would not be intimidated by IS. \"Whatever these murderers think they will achieve by killing innocent Americans like Steven, they have already failed,\" he said. 'Stand-up philosopher' Mr Sotloff, 31, was abducted in northern Syria a year ago. He is thought to have been kidnapped near the city of Aleppo, and to have been held in the IS stronghold of Raqqa. Reports suggest his family initially did not publicly confirm his abduction because of official advice that no publicity would improve his chances of release. The freelance journalist wrote for several publications, including Time magazine, Foreign Policy, the Christian Science Monitor and World Affairs Journal. He reported from countries including Egypt, Libya and Syria. On his Twitter account, which has been inactive since 3 August 2013, Mr Sotloff described himself as a \"stand-up philosopher from Miami\". He tweeted about current affairs in Syria, Libya, Egypt and Turkey - but also about his love for the Miami Heat basketball team. 'What he loved' Mr Sotloff was Jewish and held dual US-Israeli citizenship. His mother Shirley is the daughter of Holocaust survivors, and he attended a Jewish school in Miami. He later studied journalism at the University of Central Florida, where he also wrote for the student magazine. Mr Sotloff developed a profound interest in and affection for the Middle East and its culture, travelling to Yemen to study Arabic. According to an unnamed former hostage, Mr Sotloff hid his Jewish identity from his captors and even managed to fast on the Day of Atonement - the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronot, the unnamed former hostage said that Mr Sotloff \"...told [his captors] that he was sick and didn't want to eat, even though they served us eggs that day\". Laura Kasinof of the New York Times tweeted: \"Sotloff was brave and loved the Middle East and its people. Always hung out with Yemenis more than foreigners.\" His friend Emerson Lotzia told the student magazine that journalism was \"what he loved to do\". \"Steve said it was scary over there. It was dangerous. It wasn't safe to be over there. He knew it. He kept going back,\" he said. His articles also revealed his determination to report from the field, despite the potential risks. In a 2013 report from Egypt, Mr Sotloff described his visit to a Muslim Brotherhood protest camp, despite his Egyptian friend's warning that he would be in danger there. \"After an hour of fruitless conversation over endless glasses of sweet tea, I rose, shook Ahmad's hand, and headed straight to the lair where he believed I would be devoured,\" he wrote. 'Thoughtful journalist' He often focused on the human side of the conflict, writing about the plight of displaced civilians in Syria struggling without adequate food or shelter in early 2013. In a report for Syria Deeply, Steven Sotloff wrote about the struggle of ordinary Syrians in the stricken city of Aleppo, and their increasing disillusion with the Western-backed rebel alliance, the Free Syrian Army (FSA): \"'These guys will do anything to win, even if it means destroying our youth,' says grocer Anwar Khuli, 51, throwing a disdainful look at a group of fighters buying munchkin size cups of coffee at a cafe nearby. 'They have already destroyed our country.' \"Sentiments like these reflect the disappointment that many of Aleppo's residents harbour towards a group that held so much promise for them when it first emerged. \"With each passing day, they say, their hopes are dashed by the reality that the FSA is a seriously flawed organisation. And with every gaffe and abuse, the lustre of Assad's tainted regime grows brighter.\" Mr Sotloff also reported from Libya in 2012, reconstructing what happened the night the US consulate in Benghazi was attacked. He argued that any US action following the attack should be done carefully, telling Fox News: \"The Libyans are very grateful to the Americans for what they did last year during the revolution... it's really important it stays that way because Libya can be a very strong ally in the future.\" Ann Marlowe, a writer who said she knew Mr Sotloff from his work in Libya, said that he \"lived in Yemen for years, spoke good Arabic, deeply loved (the) Islamic world\". In a statement, World Affairs Journal described him as \"an honest and thoughtful journalist\" who tried \"to understand the story from local perspectives\". It said he sought to \"report his findings straightforwardly\" and was \"certainly courageous\".",

    "text": "Abul Kalam Azad's conviction is the first verdict handed down by the controversial tribunal. The cleric, a presenter of Islamic programmes on television, shot dead six Hindus and raped Hindu women during the war, prosecutors said. He is thought to be in Pakistan and was found guilty in absentia. BBC Bengali editor Sabir Mustafa says the verdict is being seen as a triumph for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has made prosecuting war crimes a key goal of her government. Critics of the tribunal, however, say the charges against Maulana Azad and others are politically motivated. The court is not endorsed by the United Nations. Tribunal officials said Maulana Azad's family failed to co-operate with his court-appointed defence lawyer, and they did not provide any witnesses to testify on his behalf. As a result, the case was concluded fairly quickly. Mr Azad was a junior leader in the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1971 and a member of the Razakar Bahini, an auxiliary force set up to help the Pakistani army by rooting out local resistance. The Razakars were notorious for their operations targeting Hindus as well as civilians suspected of being sympathetic towards Bengali nationalists. The International Crimes Tribunal was set up by the Awami League-led government to try those Bangladeshis accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces who attempted to stop East Pakistan (as Bangladesh was then) from becoming an independent country. Those charged include a number of senior Jamaat leaders and a former minister from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). All of the people currently indicted by the tribunal deny the charges and opposition leaders accuse the government of carrying out a political vendetta. Bangladesh government figures estimate more than three million people were killed during the independence war, although some researchers put the figure at between 300,000 and 500,000.",

    "text": "By Katie SilverHealth reporter, BBC News Their survey revealed the younger the first viewing occurred, the more likely a male was to want power over women. While if they were older, they were more likely to be sexually promiscuous. Of the 330 undergraduates surveyed, with a median age of 20, the average age they first saw pornography was 13. The youngest was only five, while the oldest was 26. The unpublished findings were presented at a convention in Washington. Playboy lifestyle Lead researcher Alyssa Bischmann and her team asked the men, the vast majority of whom were heterosexual and white, when they first saw porn and whether it was intentional, accidental or forced. They were then asked 46 questions which measured how they conformed to one of two behavioural traits - seeking power over women or sexually promiscuous behaviour and living a playboy lifestyle. They found those who saw porn young were most likely to agree with statements that asserted male dominance, such as \"things tend to be better when men are in charge\". The researchers were surprised to find that seeing porn later in life was associated with a playboy lifestyle, such as preferring to frequently change sexual partners. Researcher Christina Richardson said this could be because those who were exposed to porn early often did not enjoy sex in real life. \"These men often have a lot of performance anxiety with women in real life. Sexual experiences don't go as planned or the way they do in pornography,\" she said. Alternatively \"those who see porn later, enjoy sex in real life more and therefore might be more likely to live a playboy lifestyle\". The research, which was presented at the American Psychological Association's annual convention, did not take into account how much porn the men watched, the type of porn or other demographic factors, such as their socio-economic background. It could also have been other personality traits that determined when the males were exposed to porn. 'Sexually deskilled' Peter Saddington, sex therapist at relationship support provider Relate, said: \"Pornography can and does have an impact on many young men's attitudes to sex. \"The result can be that young men develop sexist attitudes and are essentially sexually deskilled.\" Either way, Ms Richardson says porn \"is not the healthiest thing for men\". She added that young men needed \"better role models to develop more healthy beliefs about masculinity\".",

    "text": "Brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, is found in Coca-Cola fruit and sports drinks such as Fanta and Powerade. Rival Pepsi removed the chemical from its Gatorade sports drink last year. In Japan and the European Union, the use of BVO as a food additive is not allowed. Pepsi has a plan to remove the ingredient from its entire product portfolio. It uses BVO in its Mountain Dew and Amp Energy drinks sold in the US. BVO has been used as a stabiliser in fruit-flavoured drinks as it helps to prevent ingredients from separating. According to medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic, excessive consumption of soft drinks containing BVO has been linked to negative health effects, including reports of memory loss and skin and nerve problems. BVO was dropped from the US Food and Drug Administration's \"Generally Recognised as Safe\" list of food ingredients in 1970. However, drinks companies in the US are allowed to use BVO at up to 15 parts per million. 'Safe' Coca-Cola spokesman Josh Gold stressed the move to remove BVO was not an issue of safety. \"All of our beverages, including those with BVO, are safe and always have been - and comply with all regulations in the countries where they are sold,\" he said in a statement. \"The safety and quality of our products is our highest priority.\" Coca-Cola said it would switch to using sucrose acetate isobutyrate or glycerol ester of rosin, which is commonly found in chewing gum. The Atlanta-based company said two flavours of its Powerade sports drink - fruit punch and strawberry lemonade - have already replaced BVO with glycerol ester of rosin. Coca-Cola said that BVO was not used in many nations other than the US, but it would be removed from products in Canada and Latin America. Online petition Coca-Cola's decision to remove BVO from its drink reflects a growing move among companies to reconsider certain practices due to public pressure. The campaign against the use of BVO was begun by Sarah Kavanagh, a teenager from Mississippi, who questioned why the ingredient was being used in drinks targeted at health-conscious athletes. Thousands of people have since signed her online petition on Change.org to have BVO removed from drinks. Following Monday's announcement by Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Ms Kavanagh was quoted as saying: \"It's really good to know that companies, especially big companies, are listening to consumers.''",

    "text": "The four, all connected to Hezbollah, were linked to the 2005 killing by circumstantial evidence from phone records, an indictment says. Lebanon has not been able to arrest the men, who will be tried in absentia. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says the indictment contains \"no direct evidence\", Reuters reports. Mr Hariri and 21 others were killed in February 2005 in central Beirut. The tribunal released the suspects' names, photos and other biographical information last month. 'Reliable' evidence The tribunal's 47-page indictment alleges that Mustafa Badreddine, a high-ranking figure in the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, was the overall director of the operation. Salim Ayyash, another senior Hezbollah official, is alleged to have co-ordinated the attack on the ground. The other two suspects are accused of complicity and of trying to sow a false trail by producing a video tape with a fake claim of responsibility. Hariri died when 2,500kg (5,510lbs) of explosives packed into a Mitsubishi van hit his convoy on the Beirut waterfront. The indictment identifies five phone networks allegedly used to plot the assassination. It says they show surveillance of Hariri on at least 15 days before he was killed. The \"red network\" used by the assassination team went dead two minutes before the killing, according to the indictment. \"The case against the accused is built in large part on circumstantial evidence,\" the indictment says. But it also says such circumstantial evidence \"is often more reliable than direct evidence, which can suffer from first-hand memory loss or eyewitness distortion\". The accusations over the killing, which have been anticipated for more than a year, have been a major embarrassment to Hezbollah which sees itself as the standard bearer of resistance to Israel, the BBC's Jim Muir reports from Beirut. It has vehemently denied any involvement and dismissed the UN-backed tribunal as a tool of a Western and Israeli plot to discredit it. Appeal to Hezbollah Hariri's assassination plunged Lebanon into a series of political crises, killings and bombings that led to sectarian clashes in 2008, dragging the country to the brink of civil war. The UN-backed tribunal's chief prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, said publication of the indictment would \"finally inform the public and the victims about the facts alleged in the indictment\". \"The full story will, however, only unfold in the courtroom, where an open, public, fair and transparent trial will render a final verdict,\" he said. Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Rafik Hariri's son, called on Wednesday for Mr Nasrallah to hand over the suspects for trial. \"What the Hezbollah leadership is asked to do is simply to declare cutting links between it and the accused,\" said a statement from his office. \"This will be a historic stance that all Arabs and Lebanese will remember.\"",

    "text": "Petro Poroshenko said 80% of Ukraine's troops left on Wednesday morning after several days of fierce fighting. Russia said Ukrainian forces had tried to fight their way out of the town after being encircled but Mr Poroshenko insisted they were never surrounded. The rebel advance on Debaltseve, which came in spite of the recent ceasefire agreement, has been widely condemned. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the rebels' offensive had put the wider peace agreement at risk and urged Russia to \"use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire\". He also called on Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, saying Russian troops, artillery and air defence units were still active in the country. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the rebels' actions in Debaltseve had not violated the ceasefire because it was a rebel-held city when the peace agreement was signed last week. He urged rebels to provide troops who surrendered with food and clothes and said he hoped the situation in the city would \"not be used to find a pretext to actually undermine [the agreement]\". Eyewitnesses saw dozens of tanks and columns of weary Ukrainian troops retreating from Debaltseve on Wednesday. Russia's state-controlled Channel One TV showed footage of what it said were rebels raising their flag on top of a high-rise building in the town. Later rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin was quoted in Russian media as saying Debaltseve was fully under the control of separatists, although there were still \"disparate groups of the enemy\" in the southern part of town. One rebel commander in the city told the BBC that conditions were dire, with no electricity and a shortage of food and water. He said rebels were sharing their rations with the remaining civilians. 'Brutal violation' President Poroshenko said in a statement: \"Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organised manner.\" He called for \"a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements, the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry\". Mr Poroshenko visited the soldiers who had left Debaltseve in the town of Artemivsk on Wednesday. Earlier, he said it would be an honour to shake hands with \"Ukrainian heroes\". A senior Ukrainian military official said 22 Ukrainian soldiers had died in Debaltseve over the past three days. Earlier, an official at a morgue in Artemivsk said the bodies of 25 Ukrainian soldiers had been brought to the facility from Debaltseve but this has not been confirmed. Rebels have claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in clashes around the city, but Mr Poroshenko denied this. The government in Kiev admitted that that some soldiers were taken prisoner in Debaltseve, but gave no details on how many were seized. At the scene: Paul Adams, BBC News, eastern Ukraine All Wednesday, the road out of Debaltseve into government-held territory thundered to the sound of retreating armour - tanks and troop carriers full of exhausted, sometimes defiant soldiers. In a bus by the side of the road, I found one Yuri slumped on his seat, across the aisle from a sleeping colleague. He said the situation had become increasingly dire and individual units had taken their own decisions to leave. They were running out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded, he told me. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for deceiving everyone about the ceasefire. We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up. In nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve. President Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. The withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender. Mr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government. Spokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made. International observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve. The city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Most of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn. The UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher. Fighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula. Ukraine's pro-Western government says Russia is supporting the separatists with troops and weapons, but the Kremlin has consistently denied this. Minsk agreement: Key points",

It says civilians have been tortured and mutilated, and villages destroyed on an industrial scale. Conflict between government factions has continued in South Sudan despite a peace deal signed in 2015. Of the 40 senior officials identified as potentially responsible for atrocities, five are colonels and three are state governors. They have not been named by the report, but their identities could be made public at trial at a later date. The UN says the testimony gathered from survivors is \"devastating\", including some people being forced to rape family members \"in cases reminiscent of Bosnia\". One woman said her 12-year-old son was forced to have sex with his grandmother, in order to stay alive. The same woman also saw her husband being castrated. Another man saw his companion, a man, gang raped and left for dead in the bushes. \"Sexual violence against men in South Sudan is far more extensive than documented\", says the head of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, Yasmin Sook. \"What we see so far is likely just the tip of the iceberg.\" Another survivor, a pregnant woman in Lainya County, says she saw suspected opposition supporters being detained, tortured and then decapitated by SPLA fighters. She was kept with the victims' decomposing bodies. One of them was her husband's. \"There is a clear pattern of ethnic persecution,\" says Commissioner on Human Rights in South Sudan Andrew Clapham. He adds it is \"for the most part by government forces, who should be pursued for crimes against humanity\". The plan is to take the evidence of crimes against humanity to a new hybrid court which is due to be set up by the South Sudanese authorities in partnership with the African Union. But the problem is South Sudan's government is unlikely to ever set up the court because its own military allies are thought to be some of the main culprits, reports the BBC's Will Ross. South Sudan's government spokesman says it needs to \"investigate the reality\" of the UN's report because \"most of those types of reports are cut and paste\". But Ateng Wek Ateng also told the BBC: \"We take this report seriously. \"We would want the UNHCR to furnish us with information leading to the arrest of those 40 officials and we will make sure those 40 are brought to book.\"",

    "text": "In a small ceremony, Afghan officials said inmates had been transferred to their authority. The move is part of a deal to transfer all Afghan prisons back to local control ahead of the withdrawal of Nato forces at the end of 2014. Bagram prison has been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations. Although Afghan President Hamid Karzai has hailed the handover, disagreements with the US remain. Washington is insisting that it will maintain control over some detainees in the prison. Meanwhile, a new report suggests that some Taliban are open to a general ceasefire or political agreement allowing for a continuing US military presence after 2014. 'Glorious ceremony' The handover took place at a brief ceremony which correspondents say was poorly attended by US and Nato officers. \"We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody... and ensured that those who would threaten the partnership of Afghanistan and coalition forces will not return to the battlefield,\" said Col Robert Taradash, the only US official at the ceremony. \"Our Afghan security forces are well trained and we are happy that today they are exercising their capability in taking the responsibility of prisoners independently and guarding the prisoners,\" said acting Defence Minister Enayatullah Nazari. \"We are taking the responsibility from foreign forces.\" AFP news agency photos showed a small group of inmates being released as part of the ceremony. Now officially known as the Parwan Detention Centre, Bagram prison lies about 40km (25 miles) north of the capital, Kabul. It was once located in one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan, but the new Parwan facility was constructed a few miles away and populated with inmates in 2010. The US military still wants to run a section of the jail and is not handing over hundreds of detainees, saying it has the right to hold insurgents caught on the battlefield, the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Kabul reports. These include about 50 foreigners not covered by the handover agreement signed in March. Privately, the US is concerned that some high-value inmates could be released if they are handed over, our correspondent says. That has angered the Afghan president, who says that full Afghan control is an issue of sovereignty. According to Afghan officials, there is a dispute over 34 inmates in particular, but they say they have made it clear they do not want control over the foreign prisoners. Meanwhile the director of the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies, Hekmat Karzai, told the BBC that the Americans believed they had a strategic interest in keeping these detainees. \"The argument is that while they have troops on the ground it's very difficult to release these people,\" said Mr Karzai, who is a cousin of the Afghan president. Bagram has been described as \"Afghanistan's Guantanamo\" for its troubled past of prisoner abuse and indefinite detention, our correspondent says. In January 2012, Afghan investigators accused the US Army of abusing detainees at Bagram. The investigators said prisoners had reported being tortured, held without evidence and subjected to humiliating body searches. Nato and the US have rejected allegations of abuse as untrue and pointed to the fact that they have given the Afghan Human Rights commission access to check them independently. In February this year, US soldiers unwittingly burned Korans confiscated from prisoners at Bagram, leading to days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan. A US investigation said there was no malicious intent to disrespect Islam. Separately, a new report has suggested some Taliban may be open to a continuing US military presence after 2014, as long as the role is strictly defined. A briefing paper by the Royal United Services Institute contains interviews with four senior Taliban figures, in which they say they will not negotiate with President Karzai but are prepared to renounce their association with al-Qaeda as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. The report says some Taliban recognise that hosting al-Qaeda before 2001 was a mistake The BBC's security correspondent, Gordon Corera, says talks between the Taliban and the US in the past have stumbled and there remains a crucial question mark over whether the views expressed in this briefing are representative of a broad swathe of Taliban opinion rather than just the more moderate elements.",

    "text": "The move reverses a decision made in 2012 by then-Home Secretary Theresa May that forced overseas students to leave four months after finishing a degree. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the change would see students \"unlock their potential\" and begin careers in the UK. But campaign group Migration Watch called it a \"retrograde\" step. The change will apply to international students in the UK - there were around 450,000 last year - who start courses at undergraduate level or above from next year onwards. They must be studying at an institution with a track record in upholding immigration checks. Under the proposals, there is no restriction on the kinds of jobs students would have to seek and no cap on numbers. \"If one needed evidence of a new approach to immigration within government, today's announcement allowing all foreign students to stay for two years after graduation is just that,\" the BBC's home editor Mark Easton said. \"Where Theresa May introduced what she called a hostile environment around migration rules, with an ambition to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, Boris Johnson has promised to scrap that target and encourage the brightest and best to come and live and work in global Britain.\" 'To hell and back' Student Shreya Swamy, from India, says the proposal is \"a great step forward\" but it is \"a sad day\" for her as it has come too late to help students already in the UK. She has just finished studying for a master's degree at the University for the Creative Arts, in Kent and Surrey, and says she has \"struggled so much\" with the current rule giving her up to four months to look for work. Jobs for international graduates \"are close to nil\", she says, blaming their lack of experience. \"I have been through hell and back trying to figure out my career plan these past few months because it seems practically impossible to have one in the UK,\" she says. \"I feel really helpless, and almost regret coming here to study because I'm going to end up going back home with a very expensive piece of paper.\" Read more here Chancellor Sajid Javid tweeted that the move was \"about time\", adding that the government \"should have reversed this silly policy years ago\". Former universities minister Jo Johnson - who quit his brother's government last week - tweeted that it was \"success at last\" after being involved in the cross-party campaign. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the decision, saying it would benefit the UK economy and reinstate the UK as a \"first choice study destination\". \"Evidence shows that international students bring significant positive social outcomes to the UK as well as £26bn in economic contributions, but for too long the lack of post-study work opportunities in the UK has put us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting those students,\" he said. But Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the decision was an \"unwise\" step that would \"likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves\". \"Our universities are attracting a record number of overseas students so there is no need to devalue a study visa by turning it into a backdoor route for working here,\" he added. Others suggested that the overhaul of the rules should come in sooner so students who are due to graduate next year could be eligible for the visa. Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, said there was \"ample time\" for the new rules to be implemented for those who finish their studies in 2020. How many international students stay in the UK? By BBC Reality Check team Just over 450,000 international students are currently studying in UK universities. Of these, almost two-thirds are from outside the EU, so will require a student visa to be in the country. Between about 170,000 and 185,000 of these students graduate each year and, under current rules, they have four months to transfer to another visa - such as a work visa - or decide to continue studying. In 2018, 6,300 individuals moved from student visas to skilled work visas, meaning they have officially been offered a job paying at least £20,800 in the first year. A further 450 were granted \"high-value migrant\" visas, which are normally reserved for those with particular expertise in a field or those who have a set sum of money to invest in the country. We also know that almost 40,000 student visas are extended each year, implying that a large number of graduates are continuing studies in the UK. That still leaves more than 100,000 students not formally extending their visas - and we don't have complete figures for how many of them leave the UK. However, analysis of exit checks by the Office of National Statistics suggests that 97% of them were leaving on time. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Labour has always said graduates should be able to work here after their studies. \"It enables them to contribute to our economy, our universities and to research, and helps us to attract the brightest and best from around the world. \"It is a great pity that ministers have previously supported measures that did the opposite.\" 'International collaboration' The government's announcement coincides with the launch of a £200m genetics project at the UK Biobank, a charity and health resource that contains information and samples from 500,000 people. The UK Biobank collected DNA samples and health questionnaire information from 500,000 British volunteers over several years and is now open to researchers from anywhere in the world who want to use those resources to develop new treatments for diseases. The prime minister said projects of this kind wouldn't be possible \"without being open to the brightest and the best from across the globe to study and work\" in the UK. Mr Johnson said: \"That's why we're unveiling a new route for international students to unlock their potential and start their careers in the UK.\" Britain had a \"proud history\" of being at the centre of international collaboration, he said, adding that it was \"bringing together experts from around the globe to work in the UK on the world's largest genetics research project\".",

    "text": "She implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. Oregon's emergency management director Andrew Phelps said they were braced for a \"mass fatality event\" from the fires. The infernos have killed at least four in Oregon and 11 elsewhere. One hundred blazes are now scorching 12 US states. What did the governor say? She told reporters on Friday: \"As of now, there are early reports from our state police that there are dozens of missing persons related to the fires specifically in Jackson, Lane and Marion counties.\" She did not offer further details on the missing persons. The governor, a Democrat, also clarified that 40,000 Oregonians were under mandatory evacuation orders. State officials said a day earlier that half a million people were affected. But Ms Brown said on Friday the higher figure included those who remained at home but had been advised to be ready to evacuate. Ms Brown added: \"I know that rumours of looting are extremely alarming and that it's unsettling not to know whether your home is still standing. \"Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting.\" Police in Marion County, south of Portland, arrested two men after a car chase on Thursday for allegedly breaking into and looting evacuated homes in the area. The governor noted that federal aid had been approved, which will help provide additional support in fighting the fires and caring for those displaced. What's the situation in Oregon? Oregon's forestry department fire protection chief Doug Grafe said on Friday firefighters were still battling 16 large blazes, but cooling temperatures and additional moisture in the air are helping efforts. Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told Reuters of her family's frightening drive to safety through fires burning on both sides of their car. She instructed her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. \"Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,\" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson. A 41-year-old man described by police as \"a local transient\" was arrested on Friday on suspicion of starting a large fire that threatened several homes, reports KVAL-TV. But investigators said that arrest was separate from the main inquiry into the Almeda fire, which has been linked to at least two deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in the towns of Phoenix and Talent. The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle, according to IQAir.com. While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. Among the victims in Oregon are a young boy and his grandmother. The pair were killed in a wildfire near Lyons, 70 miles (110km) south of Portland. Twelve-year-old Wyatt Tofte, his dog, and his grandmother Peggy Mosso died in the family car trying to escape the blaze. His mother was found severely burnt. Lonnie Bertalotto, Ms Mosso's son and Wyatt's uncle, confirmed the deaths in a Facebook post. \"Don't take anything in life for granted and make the best of everyday,\" he wrote. Mr Bertalotto told the Oregonian newspaper what exactly happened remains unclear, but the family believes Wyatt tried to get his grandmother out of the car, but she had a broken knee and was unable to move. What is the situation elsewhere? Along with Oregon, California and Washington state are the worst affected. Around 4.5m acres - an area slightly smaller than Wales - have been burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In Washington, the state's largest wildfire in Okanogan county caused the death of a one-year-old boy as his family tried to escape the blaze. His parents remain in critical condition. In California, the death toll continues to rise. Authorities in Butte County, north of the capital Sacramento, said 10 bodies have been found in the last two days. A 16-year-old boy is among those reported killed in the fire. Another 16 people are reported as missing. The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history, the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection reports. The nation's most populous state has seen at least 20 deaths in total from fires since 15 August, when the first series of blazes began, according to Cal Fire, the agency handling the wildfires. Over 3m acres have burned in the last month, the most in a single year according to the Los Angeles Times. Tens of thousands of people were under evacuation orders in the Golden State as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires. Have you been affected by the US wildfires?

    "text": "No reason has been given, but last week Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first flogging. He was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam. His punishment has caused international outcry. Three weeks ago the case was referred to the Supreme Court by the office of then-King Abdullah. The new Saudi King Salman has issued a decree pardoning what are described as \"public right\" prisoners, which could include Mr Badawi. Suad al-Shammary, a rights activist and lawyer who worked with Mr Badawi on his blog, was released on Friday. She had been held for three months without charge over comments she made on Twitter, which her opponents portrayed as anti-Islamic. Health fears Raif Badawi, 30, was due to receive the lashes over a period of 20 weeks. The first round was carried out outside a mosque in Jeddah on 9 January as a crowd watched. Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar - who lives in Canada - told the BBC she was buoyed by Friday's developments. \"I ask the world to remain by my side until Raif is released.\" She said she now hated Fridays - the day of lashings. \"I turn into a mess, until I know his [Raif's] fate.\" Analysis: Becky Kelly, BBC News The hope Ensaf Haidar clings to week after week does not seem as impossible now as it once did. It's down to a royal decree issued by new Saudi King Salman which announced he would pardon some prisoners. The late King Abdullah did the same. The difference is that Abdullah imposed no conditions, but King Salman's pardons will be implemented by the interior minister. Sources in Saudi Arabia told me that if Raif is one of those prisoners offered a pardon, it will come with conditions he must sign in exchange for freedom. Typically, pardoned activists have had to stop their work and give up their right to free expression. In recent days Saudi officials have approached current prisoners of conscience unofficially inquiring about their thoughts on such potential conditional pardons, the human rights group Amnesty International discovered. On Thursday, Amnesty International said Mr Badawi could suffer \"debilitating long-term physical and mental damage\" if the flogging continues. \"Raif Badawi is a prisoner of conscience, whose only 'crime' was to set up a website for public discussion,\" said Amnesty's Philip Luther. Raif Badawi established Liberal Saudi Network, a now-closed online forum that sought to encourage debate on religious and political matters in 2008. In 2012, he was arrested and charged with \"insulting Islam through electronic channels\" and \"going beyond the realm of obedience\". In 2013 he was cleared of apostasy, which could have carried a death sentence. Saudi Arabia enforces a strict version of Islamic law and does not tolerate political dissent. It has some of the highest social media usage rates in the region, and has cracked down on domestic online criticism.",

    "text": "By Steve HoldenNewsbeat reporter From 2006, Camp Bastion became the large, sprawling, temporary home for thousands of British troops. At its height, it was the size of Reading - a bustling community in the middle of the Afghan desert, but now the Union Flag has been lowered. So what exactly was it like to live there? Mauricio Gris, who served seven years in the British Army, gave Newsbeat access to his personal photo collection from his time in Afghanistan. He did three tours of the country, in 2008, 2009 and 2013. Arrival at Camp Bastion \"The photos are from my first tour of Afghanistan in 2008. I was a reconnaissance troop leader with the Household Cavalry Regiment, D Squadron. \"As part of that we would travel the length and breadth of Helmand, finding the Taliban and intercepting drug running. \"We were assigned a bed space on arrival. We had two to three metres to make our own and fill it with creature comforts. \"There were eight people in our tent but to be honest ours was a lot more spacious than some of the others. \"It wasn't really as comfortable as it could have been. There was a bit of electricity for laptops but no internet.\" \"We used to prepare our weapons and vehicles before leaving the gates of Bastion. \"This photo shows our journey heading in and out of Camp Bastion. The shot is taken from the passenger side of my vehicle on our first mission out of the base. \"What's remarkable is that ground and desert eventually became a kind of 'Bastion Two' as the base sprawled out.\" \"Bastion was small when we arrived in 2008. Originally you could walk across it in five minutes. \"By the end, it took you 10 to 15 minutes to get across by car. There were even traffic wardens. It became a proper little town. \"When we started out, our tent was on the edge of Bastion. There was literally a wire fence and then the desert. It felt like we were in the middle of warfare. \"For my final tour, my tent was in the centre of this 'town'. \"I loved hanging around with the soldiers. They had an incredible sense of humour. You just had to make sure you weren't the guy who fell asleep when marker pens were flying about otherwise you'd end up with an extra eyebrow. \"Of course there was poignancy, especially during the remembrance services. The sound of the Last Post used to ram home the dangers of the job.\" Mauricio Gris went on to be a Combat Camera Team Producer with the British Army.

    "text": "The actress's publicist told the BBC the couple had taken the decision in order to \"evaluate and work on their marriage\". Douglas, 68, and Swansea-born Zeta Jones, 43, married in 2000 after meeting in France two years earlier. They have two children - Dylan, 13, and Carys, 10. The pair have both struggled with health problems in recent years. Douglas was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010, while Zeta Jones sought treatment for bipolar disorder in 2011 and again earlier this year. At this year's Cannes Film Festival, Douglas claimed his condition - which is now in remission - had been caused by oral sex. 'Second chance' The couple share the same birthday, 25 September, and met at the Deauville Film Festival in France in 1998. They had their first child in August 2000, and married three months later in a lavish ceremony at New York's Plaza hotel, where guests included Goldie Hawn, Christopher Reeve, Jack Nicholson and Brad Pitt. OK! magazine paid £1m for exclusive access to photographs of the day, but rival magazine Hello! spoiled the scoop by publishing pictures taken by somebody pretending to be a guest or a waiter. A long legal battle followed in the UK, with the couple arguing that Hello! had invaded their privacy. The case was eventually resolved in 2007, when the House Of Lords ruled Hello! had breached OK!'s confidentiality. Prior to the wedding, the couple reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement, which entitles Zeta Jones to £1m for every year of their marriage in the event of the relationship coming to an end. Douglas insisted on the contract after his first wife, Diandra, was awarded £44m in their divorce. Speaking to the Mirror earlier this month, the actor said his biggest regret was not ending his first marriage sooner. He had married Diandra in 1977 and they separated in 1995, but did not file for divorce until 2000. \"I have nothing against her and in fact I'm very fond of my first wife,\" he said, \"but we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier\". \"It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems, it's in his interest to keep the marriage going.\" In the same interview, Douglas paid tribute to Zeta Jones, who had given him \"this second chance to have a family\". \"The thing I've learned about getting older is you can't take love for granted,\" he said. \"You protect it, nurture it and it grows and after one's initial, physical emotional aspects, it becomes deeper.\" The star, whose films include Wall Street and Basic Instinct, recently made his post-cancer return to the big screen playing Liberace in the biopic Behind The Candelabra. Zeta Jones, an Oscar-winner for her role in Chicago, is currently starring alongside Dame Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis in popcorn action film Red 2.",

    "text": "Mr Obama said Mr Kerry's \"entire life\" prepared him for the role, and praised him for the \"respect and confidence\" he has earned from world leaders. Mr Kerry ran as Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His nomination comes after the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, withdrew from consideration last week. Republicans had fiercely criticised her role in the aftermath of the deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Influential senator Speaking at the White House, Mr Obama said Mr Kerry understood the need to \"harness all elements of American power\", and said the veteran senator was \"not going to need a lot of on-the-job training\". The president added that he was sure Mr Kerry would be swiftly confirmed in the Senate. Mrs Clinton, who is still recuperating from a stomach virus and concussion, was not present for the announcement. But in a statement, Mrs Clinton said Mr Kerry was an \"excellent choice\" of head for the state department. \"He will be able to sustain and extend America's global leadership,\" she said. Mr Kerry, 69, becomes Mr Obama's first new cabinet nomination since he won a second term in November. The president will also have to name a new defence secretary to replace Leon Panetta, and a new director of the CIA to take over from David Petraeus, who quit last month after admitting an affair. Mr Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, lost a close presidential election to George W Bush in 2004 and had been a contender for the state department in 2008, before Mrs Clinton was chosen. The BBC's Washington correspondent, Kim Ghattas, says Mr Kerry is well-steeped in the details of world affairs and diplomacy. She says he has been the Obama administration's unofficial envoy to various hotspots, from Pakistan to Afghanistan. If confirmed, he will face the problem of ongoing Syrian unrest and continuing concern over Iran's nuclear programme. Mrs Clinton has indicated she will step down early next year. Mr Kerry will have to give up his seat in the Senate, where he represents the state of Massachusetts. The Democrats may face a tough battle to keep it in the subsequent election. Analysts say Mr Kerry's nomination is unlikely to face opposition from Republicans, who had threatened to oppose Ms Rice, despite the president's strong defence of her actions over Libya. Mr Kerry himself had spoken up for Ms Rice, saying: \"I've defended her publicly and wouldn't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment. She's an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant.\" Ms Rice's troubles began days after the 11 September assault on the US consulate. She said in a series of TV interviews that it seemed to have developed out of protests over an anti-Islamic film. But later intelligence reports suggested the attack was carried out by al-Qaeda affiliates. Her comments triggered a major political row over who knew what and when, and whether the consulate was adequately protected. The attack left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.",

    "text": "By Massoumeh TorfehResearch Associate, LSE & SOAS Iranian media downplayed Fakhrizadeh's importance, introducing him as a scientist and researcher involved in the search for \"homegrown test kits for Covid-19\" in recent weeks. Mark Fitzpatrick, an associate fellow with London's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) who follows Iran's nuclear programme closely, also tweeted: \"Iran's nuclear program is long past the point when it is dependent on a single individual\". Yet we know that when he was attacked Fakhrizadeh was accompanied by several bodyguards, indicating how seriously Iran took his security. So, the motive for the assassination - for which no one has claimed responsibility - would appear to have been political, rather than relating to Iran's nuclear activities. Two possible motives stand out: firstly, to jeopardise potential improvements in relations between Iran and the new Biden administration in the United States. And, secondly, to encourage Iran to engage in a retaliatory act. \"The enemies are experiencing stressful weeks,\" said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in his first remarks on the assassination. \"They are mindful that the global situation is changing, and are trying to make the most of these days to create unstable conditions in the region,\" he added. When Mr Rouhani refers to Iran's \"enemies\", he is evidently talking about the Trump administration, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia are worried about the changing tide of politics in the Middle East and its consequences for them once President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Mr Biden made it clear during his election campaign that he wished to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, which was negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 and forsaken by Donald Trump in 2018. Israel and Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran were reportedly discussed at what Israeli media said was a secret meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Neom last Sunday. The Saudi foreign minister denied that the meeting took place. Mr Netanyahu was reportedly also not successful in persuading the prince to normalise diplomatic relations between their two countries. On Monday, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked a facility belonging to the Saudi oil giant Aramco in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, the opportunity to reproach the Saudis might have arisen. The hardline press in Iran boasted about \"the heroic Quds-2 Ballistic Missile attack\" by the Houthis. \"It was a strategic move, well timed to coincide with the Saudi-Israeli meeting, warning them not to miscalculate their moves,\" said the Mehr news agency. The Saudis' anger at the attack was shared by the Americans. Former US National Security Adviser John Bolton explained in his book, The Room Where It Happened, how the Trump administration viewed Iran's support for Houthis as \"a campaign against US interests in the Middle East\". The reported Neom meeting was said to have been arranged by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had just been to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where Iran was the main topic of conversation. Two weeks earlier, President Trump had asked his senior advisers whether he had options to take military action against Iran's main nuclear site, according to US media. He appeared to be looking for a showdown with Iran before his departure. In January, Mr Trump boasted about the assassination in a US drone strike in Iraq of the top Iranian military commander, Gen Qasem Soleimani, despite it later being pronounced by a UN special rapporteur as \"unlawful\". \"We stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold... at my direction,\" he said. So, it could be argued that assassinations are not altogether opposed by the president. His Iranian counterpart has blamed Israel for the assassination of Fakhrizadeh. And, indeed, many reports note that Prime Minister Netanyahu was one of the few world leaders to have spoken directly about the scientist. In a televised presentation in 2018, he talked about Fakhrizadeh's leading role in Iran's nuclear programme and urged people to \"remember that name\". While Israel is secure knowing that the US will remain committed to its security under Mr Biden, it must be concerned that his nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is a staunch supporter of the Iran nuclear deal. Mr Blinken's approach to the Middle East may also lead to more opportunities for the Palestinians. He was critical of Mr Trump's decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although Mr Biden has said he would not reverse it. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called for a \"definite punishment\" of those responsible for the assassination of Fakhrizadeh. The head of the Expediency Council, Mohsen Rezaei, has pointed to security and intelligence lapses. \"Iranian intelligence agencies must detect infiltrators and sources of foreign spy services, and thwart the formation of assassination teams,\" he said. Indeed, many Iranians on social media have asked how, despite Iran's rhetoric about its military and intelligence superiority, someone so well-guarded could be assassinated in broad daylight. There are also concerns that the killing will be used as an excuse for further arrests inside the country. Now that the Trump administration is on its way out, and Israel and Saudi Arabia are losing their main ally, Iran is looking forward to the possibility of sanctions relief from the Biden administration and the chance to rebuild its economy. As such, it would be irrational to choose retaliation.

    "text": "Haqqani died after a long illness and was buried in Afghanistan, the sources added. Rumours about Haqqani's death have circulated for some years and can still not be independently confirmed. The latest report comes a day after the Taliban acknowledged that its leader, Mullah Omar, was dead. Reports of Haqqani's death, quoting Taliban sources, also appeared in Pakistani media on Friday. One senior Afghan official said he had died six years ago. The network has never confirmed the death of its founder. A man linked to the family denied Friday's reports, telling the BBC that Jalaluddin Haqqani was still alive but ill. The Haqqani network - based in the tribal regions of Pakistan with links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban - has been behind many of the co-ordinated attacks on Afghan and Nato forces in recent years. Haqqani's son, Sirajuddin Haqqani, has long been thought to be in de facto control of the group and has just been announced as a deputy leader of the Taliban. Tribal regions Jalaluddin Haqqani was an Afghan guerrilla leader who fought Soviet troops that occupied Afghanistan in 1980s. US officials have admitted that at the time he was a prized asset of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). However, he later allied himself to the Taliban after they took power in Afghanistan in 1996. Haqqani served as a cabinet minister under the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Omar. The Haqqani network was one of several militant groups that operated from the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, which began in 2001. BBC regional analyst Charles Haviland says Jalaluddin Haqqani turned against the West with a vengeance, allowing his base in Pakistan to be used by militants who inflicted huge casualties in Afghanistan, including among Western troops. As the Haqqanis grew in strength, Pakistan's security establishment was accused of secretly supporting the group, although it has strongly denied this. Analysts say the network has always been part of the Taliban and its members accepted Mullah Omar as their leader. On Thursday the Taliban said they had appointed their deputy leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, as successor to Mullah Omar. Correspondents say the move is likely to divide the group and that many senior figures opposed the appointment.",

    "text": "The flaw affects Internet Explorer (IE) versions 6 to 11 and Microsoft said it was aware of \"limited, targeted attacks\" to exploit it. According to NetMarket Share, the IE versions account for more than 50% of global browser market. Microsoft says it is investigating the flaw and will take \"appropriate\" steps. The firm, which issued a security advisory over the weekend, said the steps \"may include providing a solution through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs\". The US government advised computer users to consider using alternative web browsers until a security fix is released. XP impact However, the issue may be of special concern to people still using the Windows XP operating system. That is because Microsoft ended official support for that system earlier this month. It means there will be no more official security updates and bug fixes for XP from the firm. Cyber security firm Symantec said it had carried out tests which confirmed that \"the vulnerability crashes Internet Explorer on Windows XP\". \"This will be the first zero day vulnerability that will not be patched for Windows XP users,\" it added. About 30% of all desktops are thought to be still running Windows XP and analysts have previously warned that those users would be vulnerable to attacks from cyber-thieves. Microsoft has suggested businesses and consumers still using the system should upgrade to a newer alternative. 'Complete control' Microsoft said that hackers looking to exploit the flaw could host a \"specially crafted website\" containing content that can help them do so. However, they would still need to convince users to view the website for them to be able to gain access to their computer. They could do this by getting them to click on a link sent via an email or instant messenger, or by opening an attachment sent through an email. However, a hacker would have \"no way to force users\" to view the content. If successful, a hacker could gain the same rights as the computer's current user. \"If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system,\" the firm warned. \"An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" But the firm added that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode, which \"mitigates this vulnerability\".",

    "text": "The US carmaker has also announced it will close three plants outside North America by the end of 2019. The moves follow rising costs and slower car sales and come as the firm focuses on its line-up of trucks, electric and self-driving vehicles. But the restructuring drew swift criticism from politicians, including President Donald Trump. \"I am not happy about it,\" he said of the plans, which undercut his claims that his policies are spurring a revival in the US auto industry. \"They better put something else in.\" Why is the company doing this? The production cuts come as buyers in North America have turned away from smaller cars to bigger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks, which now make up nearly 70% of total US car purchases. Ms Barra said GM wants to invest in electric and autonomous vehicles, which are expected to drive future industry growth. She is also responding to rising costs - including from new tariffs on materials such as steel - while preparing the firm for the next downturn, after US car sales peaked in 2016. The company said the plan would help it save about $6bn (£4.7bn) by the end of 2020. \"The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,\" said GM chair and chief executive Mary Barra. \"We recognise the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.\" What are the details? GM said it is cutting production of the Buick LaCross, Chevrolet Impala and Cruze, as well as the Cadillac CT6 and XTS - all sedans - as well as the Chevrolet Volt and older versions of the Silverado and Sierra. The closures in North America include an assembly plant in Oshawa, Canada; facilities in Detroit and Warren in Michigan; a plant in Warren, Ohio and a site near Baltimore in Maryland. It is also closing a factory in South Korea, as announced in February, as well as two other international facilities that were not specified. GM said it expects the cuts in North America to affect more than 6,100 shift workers at the five plants, as well as more than 8,000 salaried employees. Globally, the firm, which employed about 180,000 salaried and shift staff at the end of last year, is aiming to reduce the number of salaried employees by 15%, including 25% fewer executives. The firm had signalled some of its plans previously, offering voluntary buyouts to up to 18,000 workers in October. Analysis by Michelle Fleury GM boss Marry Barra said the firm was embarking on the cuts to \"keep ahead of changing market conditions\". Some of those changing conditions have little to do with the White House. But others do. Take the tariffs on steel - a key component in the production of cars. They have pushed up GM's costs by an estimated $1bn. Then there are shifting trade agreements and the president's proposal to raise tariffs on imported cars. New tax cuts passed last year were designed to encourage companies like GM to invest at home, but today's announcement signals the lower tax rates are not enough to offset rising expenses. So while investors may cheer today's moves as a boost to GM's bottom line, they're a blow to President Trump and his many boasts about bringing car industry jobs back. What is the response? Shares in the company jumped almost 5% after the announcement, but the firm faced attacks outside of Wall Street. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he called Ms Barra to express his \"deep disappointment\" in the closure of the Canadian GM plant, which has been in the province of Ontario for a century. US Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who represents Ohio, called the decision \"corporate greed at its worst\", while Republican Senator Rob Portman, also of Ohio, said he was \"deeply frustrated\". Mr Trump, whose threats have frequently singled out the car industry, said he thought the pressure on GM would lead it to direct new work to the plants, at least in Ohio. \"I was very tough when I spoke to [Ms Barra],\" he said. \"They say the Chevy Cruze is not selling well. I said well get a car that is selling well and put it back in.\" Labour unions in the US and Canada also said they would press the company to allocate more work to the factories, instead of closing them. \"To be clear, [we do] not accept the closure of the plant as a foregone conclusion,\" labour leaders at the Oshawa factory in Canada wrote to their members. \"Remember, our plant has been in this situation before with no product on the horizon and we were able to successfully campaign for continued operations.\"",

    "text": "Video showed the lawyers ransacking wards at the cardiac hospital, beating up staff and smashing equipment. As panic spread, doctors and paramedics hid, leaving patients unattended, including those in a critical state. Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the lawyers and more than 20 arrests were made. It took more than two hours to restore order, officials said. The lawyers had been protesting over the alleged mistreatment of some of their colleagues by hospital staff last month. But the final trigger for the violence appears to have been a video posted on social media by a doctor on Tuesday night in which he poked fun at the lawyers. How did the attack unfold? According to hospital administrators, more than 200 lawyers wielding sticks stormed Lahore's Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) at midday on Wednesday. Hospital officials said the lawyers forced their way past security and split into groups, attacking various departments and wards. Video footage shared on social media showed lawyers - in suits and ties - smashing medical equipment and windows, and beating up staff and officials including Punjab information minister Fayazul Hasan Chauhan who had arrived on the scene to try to restore calm. They also stormed the nurses' hostel, breaking furniture and beating some of the staff, an official complaint from the hospital says. Lawyers also damaged several cars parked outside the hospital and set at least one police van on fire. Some of the protesters allegedly fired gunshots in the air when riot police intervened. Hospital sources said at least three patients - a woman and two men - died because doctors could not attend to them during the violence. It is believed that the woman had been in the intensive care unit. Police reinforcements were eventually deployed, leading to more scuffles in which several lawyers were injured. Officers said later they had arrested more than 20 lawyers and filed complaints against about 250 on charges of violence and assault. What led up to the violence? There has been simmering anger among young lawyers since 20 November when half a dozen of them accompanied a colleague to the hospital for the treatment of his sick mother, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. There they got into an argument with hospital staff and a doctor on duty, leading to a fierce fist fight in which the lawyers were outnumbered by the hospital staff. Both sides filed police complaints against each other but no arrests were made. But tempers ran high, and both sides got their respective professional associations involved to bring pressure on the police to arrest members of the opposing party. This forced the provincial authorities to intervene and an agreement was reached on Tuesday under which the hospital staff agreed to apologise to the lawyers while the lawyers agreed to withdraw their complaint. But at that moment, the video of a young doctor bragging about how the lawyers involved in the 2 November episode had been humiliated was posted on social media and went viral, our correspondent adds. An angry meeting of the lawyers took place at the bar council's office on Wednesday morning, where many of them decided to march on the hospital about 3km (two miles) away. Footage on social media shows a lawyer walking ahead of his marching colleagues and addressing the doctor in the earlier video, inviting him to see the \"sea\" of lawyers heading towards him. What has the reaction been in Pakistan? The lawyers who took part in the attack on the hospital have been widely criticised in Pakistani media. \"Pakistanis have been witnesses to violent acts by lawyers for several years now,\" commented one television anchor on Geo TV on Thursday. \"They have assaulted citizens, attacked policemen, raised their hands on judges and vandalised courts. But yesterday they crossed all limits,\" she added. Other commentators said it was a new low for Pakistani society's sinking levels of tolerance which is giving way to mob justice. Our correspondent says the state's failure to deliver social justice lies in the rise of interest groups within political, judicial and economic circles who are protected by the country's powerful establishment. Afrasiab Khattak, a former chairman of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), tweeted that Pakistan was \"caught in a vicious cycle of anarchy and militaristic regimentation\". He added: \"Trampling of the constitution, rise of militarisation and lack of tolerance create anarchy, and a typical state response is the deployment of [paramilitary] rangers.\" After the lawyers called for a strike across Punjab on Thursday, the provincial government has asked for the deployment of rangers at all public offices, including offices of senior police officials.",

    "text": "A senior local fire official said crews were called to the Arena Corinthians after reports of a collapsed crane. It fell on top of a metal structure, destroying part of a facade. The arena was due to be completed at the end of December to meet a Fifa deadline. Brazil has admitted it is struggling to have all 12 venues ready. 'Round-the-clock' warning Brazilian police said two people had been killed in Wednesday's accident, after earlier reports quoted fire officials as saying that three had died. The crane operator was taken to hospital, but was later released. Odebrecht Infrastructure, the company building the stadium, told the BBC that the accident happened shortly before 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT). It said \"the crane that hoisted the last module of the structure of the metal roof collapsed causing the fall of the part of the circulation area of the east building\". A LED panel outside the venue was also hit. The company stressed that the structure of the stadium was not damaged. Most of the workers are believed to have been away on their lunch breaks at the time. TV footage later showed the huge metal structure buckled on top of the stadium, which is also known as Itaquerao. Corinthians, the club that will move into the new stadium, said in a short statement that it \"deeply regrets the accident\". Sepp Blatter, president of Fifa - football's world governing body - said he was \"deeply saddened by the tragic deaths\". Fifa Secretary General Jerome Valcke said: \"Extremely shocked by the news from Sao Paulo. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims of this accident.\" In a statement, the world football governing body added that \"the safety of workers is the top priority for Fifa\" and Brazil's government. The venue is being built by Brazil's Odebrecht company, which recently said the arena was about 94% ready. The stadium is expected to seat nearly 50,000 people. However, 20,000 temporary seats are to be added for the World Cup opening match due to a Fifa request. This is the third fatal accident in World Cup stadiums in Brazil, with two other construction workers killed over the past two years. Six of Brazil's stadiums - including Itaquerao - are not yet ready for the World Cup next summer. Construction problems and public protests about the money being spent have delayed the preparations, the BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro reports. On Tuesday, Danny Jordaan, who was behind South Africa's preparations for the 2010 World Cup, said Brazil might have to start round-the-clock construction work if it was to get things ready for the tournament.",

    "text": "The Salford taxi driver was delivering aid to Syria in December when he was kidnapped and then held hostage by IS. IS threatened to kill him in footage last month showing the death of Briton David Haines, and in this video they threaten US aid worker Peter Kassig. David Cameron said Britain would do all it could \"to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice\". The prime minister said the killing of father-of-two Mr Henning, 47, showed \"how barbaric and repulsive\" IS was. \"My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan's wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him,\" he said. \"Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need.\" Mr Henning's wife Barbara had this week appealed for her husband's release, saying: \"He is innocent.\" Volunteer Mr Henning was on his fourth aid mission to Syria when he was captured within minutes of arriving in the country last December. The prime minister will be briefed by intelligence and security chiefs on Saturday. Downing Street said the \"barbarity\" of the act \"underlines why it is right for Britain to join in the attacks against IS\", according to BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. \"It is also pointed out that ministers have known for some time the risk to Western hostages and cannot allow that to determine British foreign policy,\" our correspondent added. Number Ten has declined to comment on the possible use of special forces in the fight against IS. 'Generous character' IS has previously released videos showing the apparent beheading of two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker Mr Haines. The video released on Friday is yet to be verified, but it appears to show Mr Henning kneeling beside a militant, who is dressed in black, in a desert setting. The footage ends with an IS fighter threatening a man they identify as Mr Kassig. In a statement, Mr Kassig's family said he had converted to Islam and referred to him as Abdul Rahman Kassig. The family asked people around the world to pray for his release and that of \"all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe\". They also asked people to pray for Mr Henning's family, adding: \"We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration.\" Mr Henning's friend Majid Freeman described him as a \"selfless, humble, courageous individual\" who had simply wanted to help others. Mr Freeman, who was with him on the convoy when he was captured, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"He was helping the innocent people the rest of the world had abandoned. \"It doesn't make sense to kill him.\" 'British accent' BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the footage was similar to previous videos released by IS, though slightly shorter. He said it included a reference to last week's vote by UK Parliament to authorise air strikes against IS in Iraq. Like previous videos it features a militant with an apparently British accent, he added. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: \"We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents. \"If true, this is a further disgusting murder. \"We are offering the family every support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time.\" The US said it was evaluating the video and if proved real, it was \"another demonstration of the brutality\" of the militant group. Analysis Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News David Cameron's vow to catch the jihadist killers of Alan Henning and bring them to justice would seem to match the mood of the nation. But judging by the track record of previous such cases of hostages being murdered overseas, this promise has little likelihood of being fulfilled. Tony Blair made the same pledge after Ken Bigley from Liverpool was beheaded in 2004, Gordon Brown did the same when tourist Edwin Dwyer was kidnapped and killed in the Sahara, and Mr Cameron vowed to punish those who besieged the Algerian gas plant last year. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, there has not been one single case of any murderers of British hostages ever being brought to justice in Britain. Profile: Alan Henning Henning's home town 'stunned' US President Barack Obama led widespread condemnation of the killing, calling it a \"brutal murder\" and saying it was a \"great loss\" to the Syrian people Mr Henning had been trying to help. Dr Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, tweeted: \"Saddened by reported murder of Alan Henning. A despicable and offensive act. He helped Muslims. My thoughts and prayers with his family.\" Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said: \"This barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg offered his \"sincere condolences\" to the Henning family and said of IS: \"We are resolved to defeat this evil.\" Labour leader Ed Miliband called the killing \"appalling and barbaric\". Earlier this week Mrs Henning had asked for \"mercy\" for her husband, saying his family was continuing their attempts to communicate with the group. She also said she had received an audio message of her husband pleading for his life. Mrs Henning had said some people thought her husband was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but she said: \"He was in the right place doing the right thing.\" Earlier on Friday, the father of another hostage, British journalist John Cantlie, appealed for him to be released \"to those he loves and who love him\". The journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012, has so far appeared in three videos in which he has delivered scripted messages responding to military attacks on IS. RAF Tornados first hit IS targets on Tuesday, four days after Parliament authorised UK involvement in the military campaign. The aircraft have been conducting daily flights over Iraq, and carrying out air strikes against vehicles and weapons positions to assist Kurdish ground forces. The UK is among the nations that have joined forces to tackle the militant group, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria. IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken.",

Sharrouf, who served time for planning attacks in Australia, has now joined Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria. Mr Abbott said the image showed \"just how barbaric\" IS militants were. The image shows a young boy - who looks to be of early primary school age - wearing a baseball cap and a blue shirt, using both hands to hold aloft the severed head. A caption was included that read \"That's my boy\", The Australian said. It said the image was taken in the northern Syrian city of Raqa. Another picture showed Sharrouf wearing combat fatigues posing with three children believed by security personnel to be his sons, the newspaper reported. \"What we've got to appreciate is that Islamic State... is not just a terrorist group, it's a terrorist army and they're seeking not just a terrorist enclave but effectively a terrorist state,\" Mr Abbott told Australian radio from the Netherlands, where he is discussing issues related to flight MH17, the passenger plane brought down in Ukraine. \"And this does pose extraordinary problems... not just for the people of the Middle East but for the wider world. \"And we see more and more evidence of just how barbaric this particular entity is.\" Sharrouf was jailed in 2009 for four years for being part of a cell planning attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. After his release he was banned from leaving the country but used his brother's passport to travel to Syria with his family. Australia issued a warrant for his arrest in July after images emerged on what is thought to be his Twitter feed of another Australian, Mohamed Elomar, holding the severed heads of Syrian government soldiers. 'Back-up assistance' Last week, Australia announced laws that would restrict its citizens from travelling to certain countries, in a bid to prevent radicalised nationals fighting with extremist groups overseas. Between 150 and 160 Australians are believed to be fighting with militants in the Middle East, according to reports. Australia, meanwhile, says it is sending aircraft to help drop supplies to thousands of members of the Yazidi minority trapped by IS fighters on Mount Sinjar in Iraq. US and British aircraft have already dropped supplies to help the stranded people, who lack food and water and face death at the hands of the militants. The US has also conducted a series of air strikes against IS fighters. On Monday Defence Minister David Johnston indicated Australian help might not be limited to aid drops. \"We're not ruling out providing some back-up assistance to the Americans as they go in and deal kinetically with this terrorist organisation,\" he said. \"We are ready to assist in whatever way we can should we be asked to assist by the Americans and the Iraqi government.\"",

    "text": "The device's new size allows it to display an extra row of app icons on its home screen. The firm said it was 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the iPhone 4S. However, it does not feature an NFC (near field communication) chip to allow it to make touchless payments. Apple said the handset would work on Everything Everywhere's (EE) 4G LTE network in the UK. The news is likely to give EE - which runs the local Orange and T-Mobile services - an advantage against its rivals which will not launch the higher-speed data service until 2013. \"I think it's obviously what the other networks feared would happen,\" said Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst at Ovum. \"The question will be how many non-EE customers make the switch.\" Apple said the handset would ship on 21 September. Faster speeds The new screen offers a 16:9 ratio, matching that of widescreen televisions. But its 4in (10.2cm) size remains smaller than rival displays used by Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, LG, HTC and Sony's flagship models. Phil Schiller - Apple's vice president of worldwide marketing, who unveiled the device - said existing apps would be shown with black borders until developers updated their products. The handset also features a new Apple-designed chip, called the A6. Mr Schiller suggested this made it twice as powerful as the earlier model. The camera is an eight megapixel model - the same as in the iPhone 4S, and a lower specification than LG and Sony's most recent devices. However, Mr Schiller said the equipment and associated software meant the iPhone would create better photographs in low light than before. The handset also uses a new, smaller, socket for its charger. This means owners will need to use an adapter to plug the device into existing speakers and other equipment. The adapter is listed as being £25 on Apple's site. The handset does not offer wireless charging like Nokia's Lumia 920. It will be sold with either 16 gigabytes, 32GB or 64GB of storage. The basic model will be sold for £529 in the UK, but the figure will be lower if bought with a network contract. In addition to launching the new model, Apple will continue to ship versions of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4, but is phasing out 2009's iPhone 3GS. Reworked iTunes Despite the fact that the iPhone 5 lacks several features found on its rivals, one analyst at the presentation thought it would prove popular. \"There are unprecedented levels of pent-up consumer demand that will ensure it eclipses all previous iPhone launches,\" said Ben Wood from CCS Insight. \"Newly rebranded UK network EE will be delighted by the fact the iPhone 5 supports the right flavour of 4G LTE technology.\" However, another industry watcher thought that the firm might have made a mistake by rejecting new tech in order to make the model thinner. \"The decision to omit NFC in the iPhone 5 could cost Apple,\" said Fred Huet, managing director at Greenwich Consulting. \"It is just a matter of time before the smartphone replaces the plastic card, and by skipping this technology, Apple may have missed a valuable opportunity to take the lead in this market. \"With over 400 million active credit card accounts on file, Apple had a prime opportunity to convert its customers using a sleek mobile payment system tied to the iPhone.\" Apple also announced iTunes, its media player and store for Macs and PCs, was being redesigned and would be released in October, and it also unveiled new iPods. Big earner The latest iPhone's performance will prove critical to Apple's fortunes. According to the firm's most recent earnings report the iPhone and related services and accessories accounted for 52% of $120bn (£74bn) total net sales over the nine months running up to July - 98 million handsets were sold in that time. That has helped boost its share price to new heights. At the end of last week the firm was worth $637.85bn based on its share price. That was the highest such valuation to date if you do not adjust Microsoft's 1998 figure for inflation. However, competition is intensifying. While Apple's margins may be wider, Samsung's handset sales are growing at a faster pace. According to data from IDC the South Korean firm accounted for 43.6% of the Western European smartphone market between April and June compared to Apple's 19%. The figures will have been skewed by the fact that Samsung offers more models and the Galaxy S3 was a newer device than the equivalent iPhone, but one industry watcher said the rivalry could intensify over coming months. \"Samsung has been very efficient pushing and promoting their devices offering the biggest commissions to sales people,\" Francisco Jeronimo, research manager at IDC, told the BBC. \"The momentum they are gaining with consumers is very high and people see it as a very innovative brand - and customers are clearly looking for innovation rather than just refinements. Samsung will also be likely to make further gains by making price cuts before Christmas.\" Apple's stock closed 1.4% higher.",

    "text": "They confirmed the Islamic State (IS) militant had died in a flat in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis. His body was found riddled with bullets and shrapnel in the apartment. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had received intelligence that Abaaoud had passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Friday's gun and suicide bomb attacks in the French capital left 129 people dead and hundreds injured. Key questions remain after attacks One of the other attackers, who blew himself up outside the Stade de France, was traced to Greece by his fingerprints, where he was registered as a migrant. In other developments: Confirming Abaaoud left for Syria last year, Mr Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. The minister also implicated Abaaoud in four out of six attacks foiled in France since this spring. He was linked to a plot in April to attack a church near Paris. Police are also investigating a possible connection to the attack on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August. In Belgium, he had links to an Islamist cell that was broken up in a raid by security forces in the town of Verviers in January which led to the deaths of two gunmen. Police sources told AFP news agency that the tip-off about Abaaoud's presence in Greece had come from Moroccan intelligence. Eight people were arrested and at least two killed in the raid on the property in Saint Denis. Heavily armed police stormed the building after a tip-off that Abaaoud was in Paris. A woman at the flat - reported in French media to be Abaaoud's cousin - died during the raid after activating a suicide vest. The prosecutor's office said it was still unclear whether Abaaoud had blown himself up or not. The 28-year-old was identified from his fingerprints. Mr Cazeneuve told reporters that a non-EU state had alerted France on Monday that Abaaoud had been in Greece. \"Everyone must understand it is urgent that Europe wakes up, organises itself and defends itself against the terrorist threat,\" he said. Abaaoud's movements 2013: Said to have first visited Syria, joining the Islamic State group before slipping back to his home country, Belgium 20 January 2014: Passes through Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport, en route to the Turkish city of Istanbul. Returns to Syria, where he becomes one of the faces of IS propaganda 15 January 2015: His mobile phone is reportedly traced to Greece from calls made to an Islamist cell in Verviers, Belgium 16 November 2015: Three days after the Paris attacks, a foreign intelligence service alerts France that he is back in Europe, having passed through Greece; police receive a tip-off that he is on French territory 18 November 2015: Killed in police raid on Paris suburb of Saint Denis, five days after reportedly heading the attacks in Paris that left 129 people dead Profile of Abdelhamid Abaaoud How the Saint-Denis raid unfolded The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the identification of Abaaoud raises serious questions for security services. He was high on French and Belgian wanted lists and yet managed to travel from Syria to the heart of Paris without ever leaving a trace. Investigators are still looking for another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have travelled to Belgium after the attacks on Friday night. More on the Paris attacks Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath Also on Thursday, Belgian police raided properties linked to Bilal Hadfi, who is believed to have blown himself up outside the Stade de France stadium during Friday's attacks. Seven of the arrests were linked to Hadfi while the other two were connected more generally to the Paris attacks, prosecutors said. What is Islamic State? IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. What does it want? IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death. How strong is IS? IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multi-national coalition, which has vowed to destroy it. More on Islamic State?

    "text": "BBC Trending What's popular and why Two Arabic hashtags that translate to \"Raif Badawi's public lashing\" and \" lashing Raif Badawi\" trended in Saudi Arabia with more than 250,000 tweets after news of carrying out the first round of lashes on Badawi was announced. Badawi was arrested in June 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after being charged with offences ranging from cybercrime to disobeying his father and insulting Islam on his \"Saudi Liberal Network\" website - which is now offline. The punishment has been condemned by the US and human rights organizations. But the online conversation is far less united on the matter. Saudi Arabia adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law and it is still taboo to have open discussions about religion. Apostasy - renouncing Islam - carries the death penalty, and in 2008 Badawi was arrested and accused of that crime (although he was later released). So it came as little surprise to Saudis that the authorities would carry out the lashing. \"He established a network to spread apostasy and to offend religion and the prophet's verses and some people cry for him, I say he deserves more than this,\" one Saudi twitter user commented. But there were many who expressed their anger and dismay at the sentence, especially at a time when Saudi Arabia is battling with extreme fundamentalism. \"It's religious extremism that deserves punishment because it's what brought us the Islamic State and not liberalism which fights extremism\" commented another Saudi on Twitter. And while #JeSuisCharlie trended worldwide after the Charlie Hebdo attack, some of those who support Badawi started #JeSuisRaif to raise awareness about his case. Maryam Namazie tweeted \"All those tweeting #JeSuisCharlie should also tweet #JeSuisRaif. @raif_badawi sentenced to 10 years prison & 1000 lashes. Saudi Govt STOP\". Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haider, who is currently living in Canada, said she was hoping the authorities wouldn't carry out the sentence. \"I've been in shock since hearing the news yesterday. My husband doesn't deserve this,\" she told BBC Trending. But Haider was less surprised with the reactions online. \"I found supporting messages from around the world more than I did from Saudi Arabia. I suppose people are scared of the authorities,\" she said. Elham Manea, an associate professor of politics at Zurich University, believes that there could be a possible number of reasons why the punishment was carried out. \"It could be because Saudi Arabia wants to show that it will not submit to international pressure,\" said Manea, who has been campaigning for Badawi's release. \"It could also be about an internal struggle and rivalry inside the ruling family.\" \"But I'd say the most likely possibility is that the ruling family needs the support of the religious establishment against the tides of Arab Spring and dissident voices inside the kingdom, so this is what they are offering in exchange for their support,\" said Manea. Both Manea and Haider are sceptical about the authorities responding to international pressure. \"I hope that our efforts to try to free Badawi will succeed but I cannot tell if Saudi Arabia will feel it needs to respond to international pressure now that it sees itself as vital ally in the fight against terrorism,\" Manea said.

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News A team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \"light enough to see across\" at night. However, they caution there is not enough evidence to advise people to buy thicker curtains or turn off lights. The study of 113,000 women was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. The women were asked to rate the amount of light in their bedrooms at night as: Their answers were compared to several measures of obesity. Body Mass Index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference were all higher in women with lighter rooms. Prof Anthony Swerdlow, from the Institute of Cancer Research, told the BBC: \"In this very large group of people there is an association between reported light exposure at night and overweight and obesity. \"But there is not sufficient evidence to know if making your room darker would make any difference to your weight. \"There might be other explanations for the association, but the findings are intriguing enough to warrant further scientific investigation.\" Body Clock One possible explanation is that the light is disrupting the body clock, which stems from our evolutionary past when we were active when it was light in the day and resting when it was dark at night. Light alters mood, physical strength and even the way we process food in a 24-hour cycle. Artificial light is known to disrupt the body clock by delaying the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, from the Surrey Sleep Centre, said there would be no harm in trying to make bedrooms darker. He told the BBC: \"People in general are not aware of the light present in their bedroom, I think people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker.\" Street lights, some alarm clocks and standby lights on electrical equipment such as televisions could light a room, he said. \"Overall this study points to the importance of darkness,\" he concluded. Cancer The study was funded by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and the findings emerged from a long-term study to understand the risk factors for breast cancer. Obesity is known to increase the odds of the disease. Dr Matthew Lam, from the charity, commented: \"It's too early to suggest that sleeping in the dark will help prevent obesity, a known risk factor for breast cancer, but the association is certainly interesting. \"Whilst we are learning more and more each day about the environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that affect breast cancer risk, it is not yet possible to predict who will get breast cancer, and for women who have been diagnosed with the disease, we can't yet say what caused it.\"",

    "text": "He is being investigated over his alleged role in the death of Anvay Naik, an architect who designed his studio. Mr Goswami and Republic TV network deny allegations that he owed money to Naik, who took his life in 2018. Mr Goswami approached the top court after a lower court denied him bail. A two-judge bench granted him interim bail after hearing his petition via video conference. \"We must send a message today to the high courts as well. Please exercise your jurisdiction to uphold personal liberty,\" Justice DY Chandrachud said. He was referring to Mr Goswami's allegation that he was being targeted over his journalism. Mr Goswami is a polarising figure whose contentious broadcasts have earned him loyal viewers as well as critics, many of whom accuse him of being sympathetic to right-wing politics in the country. His arrest has also divided opinion, with many alleging it was politically motivated. In recent months, he has been particularly critical of Mumbai police over their handling of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. He often accused them of being lenient in their investigation into the star's death. His criticism also often extended to the Maharashtra government, which is run by a coalition headed by the Shiv Sena party, a former regional ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But the speed with which Mr Goswami's case was listed - the lower court had denied him bail just two days before - also appeared to raise eyebrows, prompting one lawyer to write to the court. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave wrote that it was \"deeply disturbing\" how Mr Goswami's petition was listed \"instantly\" when \"thousands of citizens are languishing\" in jail, waiting for their cases to be heard for \"weeks and months\". What is the case against Mr Goswami? After Mr Naik killed himself, his wife accused Mr Goswami of not paying his fee. She said her husband had left a suicide note in which he blamed Mr Goswami for his death. She has been campaigning on social media for the case to be investigated thoroughly. Maharashtra state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh recently ordered a special team to look into the case. A police team arrested Mr Goswami from his home in Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, on 4 November. Images showed scuffles taking place between Mr Goswami and the police. Republic TV has accused the police of \"manhandling\" Mr Goswami's family members. But the police then accused Mr Goswami of misbehaving with them - they registered a police complaint against him for allegedly assaulting a female police officer. The Editors Guild of India urged the authorities to \"ensure that Goswami is treated fairly and state power is not used against critical reporting by the media\". A host of senior leaders and federal ministers belonging to the BJP have also criticised his arrest, saying it was \"an attack on the media's freedom of expression\". But the main opposition Congress party, which is a coalition partner of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, has accused the BJP of \"selective outrage\". The party said BJP ministers do not speak out when journalists are harassed and arrested by states where it's in power.",

    "text": "The proposed bans include cotton and tomato products which are two of China's major commodity exports. The Trump administration has been ratcheting up pressure on China for its treatment of Xinjiang's Uighur Muslims. In recent years China has massively increased security in Xinjiang, citing a threat of separatism and terrorism. By some estimates up to a million people have been detained without trial for minor infractions, in what China says are re-education camps. The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is currently preparing Withhold Release Orders which allows it to detain shipments based on suspicions of forced labour involvement. The law is aimed at combating human trafficking, child labour and other human rights abuses. Earlier this year US lawmakers proposed legislation that would assume that all goods produced in Xinjiang were made with forced labour and would require certification that they are not. Washington and Beijing have repeatedly clashed over the high-security detention camps, which China says are necessary to improve security. \"We have reasonable but not conclusive evidence that there is a risk of forced labour in supply chains related to cotton textiles and tomatoes coming out of Xinjiang,\" CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner Brenda Smith told Reuters in an interview. \"We will continue to work our investigations to fill in those gaps,\" she added. The proposed bans could have a far-reaching impact for US retailers, clothes makers and food producers. China produces about 20% of the world's cotton with most of it coming from Xinjiang. The region is also a major source of petrochemicals and other goods that feed into Chinese factories. This week, US entertainment giant Disney came under fire for shooting its new film Mulan in the Xinjiang province. The film was already the target of a boycott after its lead actress backed a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters.",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The social network had introduced a temporary ban in May following complaints that the clips could cause long-term psychological damage. The US firm confirmed it now believed its users should be free to watch and condemn such videos. It added it was, however, considering adding warnings. One suicide prevention charity condemned the move. \"It only takes seconds of exposure to such graphic material to leave a permanent trace - particularly in a young person's mind,\" said Dr Arthur Cassidy, a former psychologist who runs a branch of the Yellow Ribbon Program in Northern Ireland. \"The more graphic and colourful the material is, the more psychologically destructive it becomes.\" Two of the firm's official safety advisers have also criticised the decision. Facebook allows anyone aged 13 and above to be a member. Its terms and conditions now state that it will remove photos or videos that \"glorify violence\" in addition to other banned material, including a woman's \"fully exposed breast\". New rules The BBC was alerted to Facebook's change in policy by a reader who said the firm was refusing to remove a page showing a clip of a masked man killing a woman, which is believed to have been filmed in Mexico. It was posted last week under the title, Challenge: Anybody can watch this video? \"Remove this video too many young innocent minds out there shouldn't see this!!!\" wrote one user in the comments section below. \"This is absolutely horrible, distasteful and needs to be removed... there are too many young minds that can see this. I'm 23 and I'm very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it,\" wrote another. The social network later confirmed it was allowing such material to be posted again. \"Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events,\" said a spokeswoman. \"People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different. \"However, since some people object to graphic video of this nature, we are working to give people additional control over the content they see. This may include warning them in advance that the image they are about to see contains graphic content.\" The firm also disabled the adverts for third-party products that had been appearing alongside the video. Advisers concerned Facebook originally pulled decapitation videos after the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of its Safety Advisory Board - complained that they \"crossed a line\". The charity's leader Stephen Balkam told the BBC he was surprised by the latest development. \"I would have expected a heads-up on this,\" he said. \"I went to have a look at the video and there's no warning label nor is there any condemnatory context. It's just sort of up there and the first image you are presented with is a woman's head being held by a guy. \"I'm very unhappy that these have gone back up and that they have gone up without any warning. First thing tomorrow morning I intend to raise this with Facebook.\" Another of the board members, London-based Childnet International, said it also had concerns. \"Such content should be taken down,\" said its chief executive Will Gardner. \"There is a need to raise issues happening around the world, there is that argument, but some content is horrific. \"We would want to see steps to try and protect people from coming across such content. I'll tell Facebook what our view is, absolutely.\" 'Profoundly shocking' Decapitation videos are available elsewhere on the net but critics have raised concern that Facebook's news feeds and other sharing functions mean it is particularly adept at spreading such material. \"I have seen some of these videos - they are profoundly shocking,\" said John Carr, who sits on the executive board of the UK government's Council on Child Internet Safety. \"Facebook has taken leave of its senses. Those videos will fuel countless nightmares among the young and the sensitive.\" Google's rival Google+ social network has a more restrictive policy: \"Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence.\" The idea of Facebook issuing a similar blanket ban had, however, concerned some freedom-of-speech campaigners who had suggested it was the responsibility of parents - not the company - to protect children on the internet. However, the French digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said it was still concerned that Facebook was reserving the right to take down the videos if it took issue with the way they were presented. \"It shows how much Facebook is in power to decide whatever will or will not be expressed through its network,\" said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. \"It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision. Only a judicial authority should be able to restrict fundamental freedoms according to the rule of law.\"",

    "text": "Hashim, who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo, founded an Islamist group, the NTJ, which has now been banned. Police have raided the group's HQ in the eastern town of Kattankudy. The Sri Lankan president has announced a ban on face coverings, aimed at Muslim women following the attacks. The attacks targeted churches and hotels, killing at least 250 people. Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony's, which was badly damaged in the attacks. How did Hashim's relatives die? Security forces raided a house in Sainthamaruthu, near Hashim's hometown Kattankudy, on Friday. Gunmen opened fire as troops moved in, police say, and three men set off explosives, killing themselves, six children and three women. Three other people died in gunfire. A close family relative confirmed for BBC News that Hashim's father and two brothers died in the raid. Police sources who spoke to Reuters news agency named the three men as Mohamed Hashim, and his sons Zainee Hashim and Rilwan Hashim. All three had been seen in a video circulating on social media calling for all-out war against all non-believers, Reuters adds. In Kattankudy itself, police searched the headquarters of the NTJ (National Thawheed Jamath), which Zahran Hashim had led. 'Safe house' discovered by chance By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Sainthamaruthu When I entered the house where the Islamists and their families were killed on Friday evening, the smell of death was unbearable. A police officer at the site also said Zahran Hashim's mother was also believed to be among the victims. Security forces have been conducting raids across the country but this safe house was discovered by chance, when the suspicious house owner and local people alerted the police. Every day, police are making arrests, seizing weapons, explosives and jihadist material suggesting the radicalisation process, however small it may be, has been happening over a period of time. If the security agencies had missed this, then it is a colossal failure. The ongoing raids and discovery of weapons and material are gradually building up tensions among the communities. A hotel owner said she was worried because she was a Catholic. Muslims say they are nervous to visit Sinhala-majority areas. Some foreign governments have warned that there is a possibility of further attacks and if those happen, fragile ethnic relations could be further strained. Announcing the ban on face coverings, which will begin on Monday, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was taking the emergency measure on national security grounds. The announcement made no specific mention of the niqab and burka - worn by Muslim women - but instead said people's faces should be fully visible so they could be identified. What happened on Easter Sunday? Sri Lanka has been on high alert since a co-ordinated wave of bombings last Sunday, which also wounded more than 500 people. The bombings targeted churches that were packed full for the Easter holiday, as well as hotels popular with tourists. As well as St Anthony's Shrine, bombers struck churches in Negombo and the eastern city of Batticaloa, and hotels in the capital, Colombo. Most of those killed were Sri Lankan, but dozens of foreign citizens were also among the dead. While the authorities have blamed the NTJ for the attacks, they say they must have had help from a larger network. The Islamic State group, which carried out mass attacks on civilians in Paris and other locations in recent years, has said it was involved, but has not given details. How are the victims being remembered? Christians in Sri Lanka prayed at home while the Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, held a televised Mass, attended by the president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He called the attacks an \"insult to humanity\" in the service, broadcast from a chapel in his residence. \"Today during this Mass we are paying attention to last Sunday's tragedy and we try to understand it,\" he said. \"We pray that in this country there will be peace and co-existence and understanding each other without division.\" Scores of people gathered for the public service outside St Anthony's, where Buddhist monks joined Catholic priests in a show of solidarity with the Christian community. Crowds of people watched the heavily-guarded church from behind a barricade, with some singing hymns and passing rosary beads through their hands. Many lit candles and placed them in a makeshift memorial for the victims. The church's bells tolled at 08:45 (03:15 GMT) - the exact moment a bomber detonated his device one week ago. The hands of its damaged clock tower are still stuck at that time.",

    "text": "Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, a key figure in the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was accused of mass killing and torture and convicted of five of seven charges. Prosecutors say he led a militia accused of killing leaders and intellectuals supporting independence. The party's spiritual leader was jailed for 90 years on Monday. Hundreds killed Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday to protest against Ghulam Azam's sentence, which was handed down by the International Crimes Tribunal in Dhaka. At least two people were killed when police clashed with demonstrators. The tribunal was set up in 2010 by the current Awami League-led government to try alleged local collaborators of the Pakistani army during Bangladesh's war of independence. More than 100 people have been killed since January in violent protests prompted by verdicts handed down by the tribunal. Jamaat-e-Islami says the trials are politically motivated, and Human Rights Watch describes them as \"flawed\". AFP news agency reported that Justice Obaidul Hassan ordered that Mr Mujahid be \"hanged by the neck\" after the panel of three judges read out the verdict at Wednesday's hearing to the packed courtroom in Dhaka. Mr Mujahid was a student leader in 1971 and among those who supported a unified Pakistan. Like many other Jamaat leaders he went into hiding soon after independence, but resurfaced after Gen Ziaur Rahman came to power in a military coup in 1977. He later became social welfare minister in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government from 2001-2006. He is highly regarded for his oratory and organisational skills, but critics say he was a leader of the al-Badr group, which was an auxiliary force that helped the Pakistani army identify and kill pro-independence Bengali activists. There is a range of estimates for the exact number of people killed in the nine-month Bangladeshi war of secession. Government figures suggest as many as three million people died.",

    "text": "By Denise WintermanBBC News Magazine It was one incident in particular that drove home to Emily just how voracious her four-year-old daughter's appetite is. \"It was really early in the morning and I heard the freezer door alarm go off. I went down to the kitchen and found my daughter eating frozen potato cakes straight from the packet. We don't have them in the house anymore, we can't.\" Emily, not her real name, describes it as a \"low point\", but she has come to accept that whatever food is in the house her daughter has a big appetite for it. \"I remember the world's most enormous carrot poking out of her skirt pocket on the way to her first day at drama class. She told me it was in case she got hungry. It's curious and complicated being the parent of a child with a compulsion to eat.\" Children's eating habit are constantly in the news and for good reason. Just recently it was reported there has been a four-fold increase in the number of children and teenagers admitted to hospital for obesity-related conditions in the last decade. Appetite differs from person to person, say scientists. \"We are all designed to be variable,\" says Prof Stephen Bloom, an obesity expert from Imperial College London who studies the body's appetite control systems. \"You can tell from the outside each person is different, it's the same inside our bodies.\" At each end of the scale you get extremes, from children who pick at their food to those who want to eat almost constantly. Despite what people often suggest it's not always down to bad eating habits, says Michelle, not her real name. Her 11-year-old son is always hungry and she says managing his diet is complicated and exhausting. \"You often get frustrated and angry with your child for being so hungry and they get frustrated and angry with you, but in our case I don't think anyone or anything is to blame. \"There is nothing wrong with my son, no medical condition or issues with food. He is genuinely hungry, not greedy. I don't blame myself as I do all I can to feed him healthy food. \"It can be exhausting, you always have to be on top of things. You try not to make a big deal as you don't want your child to develop problems with food. \"He isn't overweight at the moment because I am controlling what he eats. I'm also trying teach him about food and to understand the consequences of making bad choices. But he won't always live at home with me and I do worry what will happen in the future.\" Weight often becomes an issue for parents in the same situation. It is a concern for Emily, but she says her daughter has always been bigger than her siblings, as well as hungrier. \"She fed well as a baby and was often off the upper end of the baby weight whereas her older brother is tiny,\" she says. \"It's not what she is eating, she will snack on sugar-snap peas as happily as another child would eat a biscuit. I am strict and at times she has screamed and wailed, but I have been firm and she has learned what she is allowed. She simply loves food.\" As children get older, their life extends beyond the home and the struggle gets even harder. \"On her first week at school she was going up for seconds at school dinners and being given them,\" says Emily. \"I've had to change to packed lunches as it is the only way I can control how much she eats and what she eats.\" Research is being done into how to control appetite. \"We actually know very little, appetite is such a complex thing,\" says Sadaf Farooqi, a professor of metabolism and medicine at the University of Cambridge. She also heads the Genetics of Obesity Study, a cohort of doctors, nurses, scientists and research staff working together to understand why some people put on weight more easily than others. \"What we do know is there is an inherited, genetic component to appetite but it is also regulated by environment and behaviour, among other things.\" Taste also comes into it, she says. Scientists know not all people experience taste in the same way and some foods can taste nice to one person and unpalatable to another. Health campaigners say they are contacted by parents worried about their child's large appetite but in a lot of cases it's the unconscious behaviour of parents that is the cause. This includes things like serving up adult-size portions to children and using adult-sized plates Some advocate leaving children to eat what they want as long as it is healthy, as clinical evidence suggests that children naturally eat to their appetite. \"Children don't typically eat more than they need,\" say Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum. \"If you leave them to make their own decisions they learn how to regulate food. If they are putting on weight you up the amount of exercise they do. It's about balancing energy in and energy out.\" But some parents dispute they are contributing to the problem and say such opinion leaves them feeling isolated. \"I've been told this by people before,\" says Michelle. \"When it comes to my son I just don't think it is the case, it's the way he was made.\" In the end parents come up with their own coping mechanisms. \"I talked to my husband, we came up with ground rules and explained them to our daughter,\" says Emily. \"We are managing at the moment but we know that as she gets older we will face different challenges.\" You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook",

The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town. The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. 'Rich pickings' During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase. It is not yet known who the owner was. If the value of the jewels is confirmed, it would reportedly be the second-largest heist in France. A Cannes police spokesman said: \"A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels. Thieves see Cannes as rich pickings.\" The Cannes film festival, which attracts celebrities from around the world, was hit by two jewellery thefts in May this year. A necklace by Swiss jeweller De Grisogono reportedly worth 1.9m euros ($2.5m; £1.6m) vanished after a celebrity party at a five-star hotel in the resort town of Cap d'Antibes. A week before, more than 777,000 euros ($1m; £650,000) worth of jewels were taken from the hotel room of an employee of exclusive Swiss jewellers Chopard. The Carlton Hotel itself saw also a huge robbery in August 1994, when gunmen burst into its jewellery store just as it was closing and made off with jewels then valued at £30m (now $77m; £50m; 58m euros). France's biggest ever robbery took place in 2008, when three men stole almost every piece on display at a jewellery exhibition in Paris with an estimated value of 85m euros ($113m; £73m).",

Bunte had quoted a source at the end of last year as saying that Schumacher could manage some steps with the help of therapists and could raise an arm.

    "text": "Images from a joint Homeland Security and FBI bulletin show the remains of a dark backpack, a detonation device and mangled pieces of metal. Three people were killed and more than 170 injured when two devices exploded near the finish line of Monday's race. Those who died were an eight-year-old boy, a woman aged 29 and a postgraduate student from China. The BBC's Paul Adams, in Boston, says vigils for the victims were held across the city on Tuesday night as Bostonians still wrestled with why anyone would want to attack their much-loved marathon. President Barack Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for a memorial. 'Someone knows' FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers told a news conference that pieces of nylon had been recovered from the scene, along with fragments of ball bearings and nails that were \"possibly contained in a pressure-cooker device\". He said they were being sent to the agency's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where experts would reconstruct the devices to determine their make-up and components. \"The investigation is in its infancy,\" he added. \"There are no claims of responsibility and the range of suspects and motives remains wide open.\" Mr DesLauriers urged people to report anyone they had seen acting suspiciously. \"Someone knows who did this,\" he said. The Associated Press quoted a source close to the investigation as saying that the bombs consisted of explosives placed in 1.6-gallon (6-litre) pressure cookers, one with shards of metal and ball bearings, the other with nails. The bombs were put into black bags and left on the ground, the source said. It has been reported that a circuit board and battery pack - parts of a triggering mechanism - were recovered. And the lid of a pressure cooker, apparently blown off during the explosion, was found on the roof of a nearby building, an official said on Wednesday. Doctors treating the wounded say their injuries indicate that the bombs contained metal shards and other shrapnel. A number of victims have had limbs amputated. Boston Medical Center trauma surgery chief Peter Burke said hospitals were saving \"large quantities\" of fragments extracted from victims for the police. They include metal, plastic, wood and concrete. At least 58 of the injured have been released from various hospitals around the city, according to AP. Of those that remain, 17 patients are listed as in a critical condition. President Obama will address an interfaith service in Boston for the victims on Thursday morning. The White House said Mr Obama had cancelled a planned trip to Kansas to speak. President Obama has condemned the bombings as a terrorist act. He said the attack was \"heinous and cowardly\" but stressed it was not yet known whether an organisation - either domestic or foreign - or a \"malevolent individual\" was responsible, nor what the motive might have been. \"Everything else at this point is speculation,\" he said. \"It will take time... but we will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice.\" One of those who died has been named as eight-year-old Martin Richard, from the Dorchester area of Boston. He was at the finishing line with his mother and sister, who were both seriously injured. \"They were looking in the crowd as the runners were coming to see if they could identify some of their friends when the bomb hit,\" Congressman Stephen Lynch, a friend of the Richard family, told Associated Press. Flowers and tributes were being placed outside the family's home on Tuesday. A second victim was named as Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Her mother, Patty, shaking with emotion, told reporters that \"you couldn't ask for a better daughter\". \"Everybody who knew her loved her... she had a heart of gold. This doesn't make any sense.\" Boston University said the third person who died was a graduate student. The Chinese consulate in New York confirmed that she was a Chinese national. \"At the request of her family, the victim's personal information will not be disclosed,\" said a statement from the consulate. She has been identified, however, by a Hong Kong TV channel which said she was from Shenyang in north-eastern China. The university said she was with two friends watching the race near the finish line. One of the friends, named as Zhou Danling by Chinese TV, was said to be in a stable condition in hospital. The consulate said it was providing \"all necessary assistance\" to the two families. The first explosion went off close to the finish line at about 14:50 local time (18:50 GMT) on Monday. Seconds later, as rescuers were rushing to help the injured, another explosion went off nearby. Police have asked the public to send in any videos or photographs they may have from the day. The London Marathon - the next major international marathon - is to go ahead on Sunday, with police saying they have well-rehearsed security plans. Organisers have said they will hold a 30-second silence at the start as a mark of respect.",

    "text": "They said rising cases meant domestic demand was expected to pick up in the coming weeks, and so the doses were needed for India's own rollout. The move - described as a \"temporary squeeze\" by officials - is expected to affect supplies until the end of April. Some 190 countries under the Covax scheme are likely to be affected. The scheme, which is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations. India's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII), has delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to several countries in recent days, including the UK and Brazil. India has exported more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries so far, with the majority of these being the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Why has India taken this step? The decision comes as India faces a surge in coronavirus cases. On Wednesday it recorded its sharpest daily rise this year, with more than 47,000 new cases and 275 deaths. It is opening up vaccinations for those over the age of 45 from 1 April, and officials expect demand for vaccinations to increase. \"[The export hold] is a temporary measure. Domestic demand will have to take precedence,\" one foreign ministry source told the BBC's Soutik Biswas. They said there was likely to be a squeeze on vaccine supplies until April, but the situation could ease come May when at least one additional vaccine is expected to be given emergency approval. There have been no exports from India since Thursday, according to the foreign ministry's website. \"Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,\" one source at the ministry told Reuters news agency. \"No exports, nothing [until] the India situation stabilises.\" There has been no official comment from the government or the SII on the decision. What's the background? The SII - the world's largest vaccine manufacturer - has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca jab to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Last week, the BBC reported that a delivery of five million doses had been held up by four weeks. \"We will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India,\" an SII spokesperson said at the time. The SII has said it will produce one billion doses this year for low- and middle-income countries. And in January, it said it could turn out between 60 and 70 million vaccine doses a month. This figure included the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the US-developed Novavax jab, which is not yet licensed for use in India. That month, the SII also told the BBC that it was aiming to boost its monthly production to 100 million doses from March. However, a recent check revealed production was still at 60 to 70 million doses and had not increased. The Indian government began its vaccination programme on 16 January, and so far has inoculated over 47 million people amid fears of a possible second wave. The authorities are hoping to administer 600 million doses within seven months - about 85 million doses a month.",

    "text": "The divorce papers were filed at the New York State Supreme Court. The couple, married in 1999 aboard a private yacht in New York, have two daughters together, Grace and Chloe. In 2011, Ms Deng famously leapt to her husband's defence to slap a protester who threw a pie at him as British MPs quizzed him over phone-hacking. Mr Murdoch, 82, met his Chinese-born third wife in 1997 at a cocktail party in Hong Kong. They were married two years later, weeks after his second divorce. Pre-nup Ms Deng, 44, is 38 years younger than the Australian-born media mogul, who is said by Forbes to be worth $9.4bn (£6bn). \"I can confirm for the record that Rupert filed in New York State Supreme Court this morning for divorce,\" Murdoch spokesman Steven Rubenstein told AFP news agency on Thursday. The BBC's Robert Peston says the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement and have held shares in trust for their children. So our business editor believes the divorce is not likely to lessen the magnate's grip on his media empire. Mr Murdoch, now a US citizen, reportedly paid $1.7bn in his divorce settlement from his last wife. Ms Deng, said to be the daughter of a factory director, was born in 1968 and grew up in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou before leaving for the US at 19 to study. She worked in a Chinese restaurant in California before going on to graduate from Yale University in 1996. Ms Deng was later employed by Star TV, News Corp's Asian satellite-television operation in Hong Kong, where she met Mr Murdoch during one of his visits. The divorce filing comes two days before News Corp is to be split into two companies, one for its entertainment assets and the other for its publishing business. Mr Murdoch is to be chairman of both firms. His global media portfolio includes the Wall Street Journal, television channels such as Fox News and Sky, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. Two years ago, his UK newspaper division became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal, which led Mr Murdoch to close one of the titles, the News of the World. In July 2011, Ms Deng jumped from her seat during a UK parliamentary hearing to slap a prankster who tried to shove a shaving-cream pie into Mr Murdoch's face.",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter, BBC News About 30 of the superpressure balloons are being launched from New Zealand from where they will drift around the world on a controlled path. Attached equipment will offer 3G-like speeds to 50 testers in the country. Access will be intermittent, but in time the firm hopes to build a big enough fleet to offer reliable links to people living in remote areas. It says that balloons could one day be diverted to disaster-hit areas to aid rescue efforts in situations where ground communication equipment has been damaged. But one expert warns that trying to simultaneously navigate thousands of the high-altitude balloons around the globe's wind patterns will prove a difficult task to get right. Airborne for months Google calls the effort Project Loon and acknowledges it is \"highly experimental\" at this stage. Each balloon is 15m (49.2ft) in diameter - the length of a small plane - and filled with lifting gases. Electronic equipment hangs underneath including radio antennas, a flight computer, an altitude control system and solar panels to power the gear. Google aims to fly the balloons in the stratosphere, 20km (12 miles) or more above the ground, which is about double the altitude used by commercial aircraft and above controlled airspace. Google says each should stay aloft for about 100 days and provide connectivity to an area stretching 40km in diameter below as they travel in a west-to-east direction. The firm says the concept could offer a way to connect the two-thirds of the world's population which does not have affordable net connections. \"It's pretty hard to get the internet to lots of parts of the world,\" Richard DeVaul, chief technical architect at Google[x] - the division behind the scheme - told the BBC. \"Just because in principle you could take a satellite phone to sub-Saharan Africa and get a connection there, it doesn't mean the people have a cost-effective way of getting online. \"The idea behind Loon was that it might be easier to tie the world together by using what it has in common - the skies - than the process of laying fibre and trying to put up cellphone infrastructure.\" 'Low risk' Previous proposals to provide connectivity from the upper atmosphere suggested floating high-altitude platforms that stayed in one place and were tethered to the ground. Google rejected this idea as it involved fighting the winds, meaning the equipment would have to be large, expensive and limited to a fixed area. But using free-floating balloons introduces another problem: how to ensure they are where they are supposed to be. \"We didn't want them to go just wherever the winds took them, we wanted them to go where the internet is needed on the ground,\" said Mr DeVaul. \"You have to cause them to move up or down just a little bit through the stratosphere to catch the appropriate wind - which is how we steer them. \"So we have to choreograph a whole ballet of this fleet, and that requires some impressive computing science and a whole lot of computing power.\" The balloons will communicate with Google's \"mission control\" where computer servers will carry out the calculations needed to keep them on track, monitored by a small number of engineers. The software makes adjustments to each balloon's altitude to take advantage of forecast wind conditions, and nudges the balloons up or down to find a more favourable stream when the predictions are not accurate. Since the equipment is dependent on solar power, the algorithms must also ensure there is enough charge left in the batteries to allow them to carry on working as they travel through the night. At the end of their working life, the software initiates a controlled descent so that the kit can be recovered by teams of locally-based employees. \"They have aviation transponders on them and we're in constant contact with civil aviation authorities while the balloons are going up and coming down,\" Mr DeVaul added. \"They have flashing lights and radar reflectors, so as far as aviation hazards go these Loon balloons present very low risk to aircraft. \"And they also pose low risk to anybody on the ground because even in the unlikely scenario that one suddenly and unexpectedly fails, they have parachutes that are automatically deployed.\" A group of about 50 testers based in Christchurch and Canterbury, New Zealand, have had special antennas fitted to their properties to receive the balloons' signals. Google now plans to partner with other organisations to fit similar equipment to other buildings in countries on a similar latitude, so that people in Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Australia can also take part in the trial. Tough challenge The search firm is not the first to pursue such an idea. An Arizona-based firm, Space Data, already provides blimp-based radio repeaters to the US Air Force to allow it to extend communications coverage. Another Orlando-based firm, World Surveillance Group, sells similar equipment to the US Army and other government agencies. However, they typically remain airborne for up to a few days at a time rather than for months, and are not as wide-ranging. One expert cautioned that Google might find it harder to control its fleet than it hoped. \"The practicalities of controlling lighter-than-air machines are well known because of the vagaries of the weather,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, visiting professor at the University of Surrey's department of computing. \"It's going to take a lot of effort to make these things wander in an autonomous way and I think it may take them a little longer to get right than they might believe.\"",

    "text": "By Steve RosenbergBBC News, Moscow Communist Russia reckoned that in five years, you could transform an economy. Vladimir Putin's Russia has updated the idea. Over the last five years it's not the economy the Kremlin has been expanding: it's Moscow's geo-political clout. Think back to 2014. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine, Moscow - slapped with Western sanctions - looked isolated, a pariah state. Western leaders queued up to criticise President Putin, confident that pressure on the Kremlin would change its behaviour. President Barack Obama dismissed Russia as a \"regional power\". For a former superpower, that hurt. Fast forward to 2019. Today, Russia is pushing for global influence. It interfered in America's presidential election on the side of Donald Trump, according to US intelligence; it's seeking to boost its role in Africa and Latin America; and it's also exploiting divisions within Europe. Mediator in the Middle East In the Middle East, the transformation is stark. Four years after Moscow launched its military operation in Syria, Russia is replacing America as the key player and power broker in the region. In the space of just a few days, Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to the Turkish president and invited him to Moscow; he had a phone call with the Israeli prime minister where they discussed \"security issues\"; he visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It is a sign of Russia's increasing active role in the Middle East. This is how popular Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets views the change: \"The current situation in the Middle East would have been unthinkable in the days of Henry Kissinger and his idea of 'global geopolitical chess'. The oversized giant by the name of America lost its way in broad daylight… while Russian diplomacy is ahead of the game. \"Russia plays the role of the universal mediator and political broker, and none of the regional powers can ignore it.\" In Moscow, Donald Trump's decision to pull US troops away from the Syrian-Turkish border took foreign policy experts by surprise. \"There is a deep belief here that Americans are smart,\" says Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign policy analyst close to the Kremlin. \"And that if Americans do something stupid, it's not because it's stupid, but because we don't completely understand their grand design. \"For many Russians it's difficult to believe Americans might do completely crazy things. But it turns out that they can.\" Syria: Why Russia wins There are several ways in which Moscow benefits from the current situation in north-eastern Syria: When Moscow launched its military operation in Syria in 2015, the Kremlin claimed its priority was defeating international terrorism. But rebuilding Russia's influence in the Middle East was a major consideration. From its naval base in Tartus, Russia can project military power across the Mediterranean. Recent reports suggest Moscow is expanding its air base near Latakia. Balance of power changing? Russia's increasing assertiveness on the world stage has coincided with a period of political introspection in the West. \"The US and European powers are much more inward-looking than a couple of years ago,\" Fyodor Lukyanov believes. \"What we see are Russian opponents, who tried to isolate Russia, in a state of considerable flux. In contrast, Russia demonstrated a high degree of resilience to outside pressure and skilful behaviour in the Middle East.\" Resilience and skill - certainly. Enhanced influence - for sure. But for a resurgent Russia, there are potential pitfalls. This country is no economic superpower. Russia's economy is fragile and further stagnation may limit Moscow's global ambitions. As for the Middle East, the region is complex, torn by division, mistrust and hatred. Russia may have emerged as the power broker. But it faces a daunting diplomatic balancing act if it to use its influence to restore peace.",

    "text": "Millions of people have been inspired to join the 16-year-old in raising awareness of environmental issues. But Svante Thunberg told the BBC he was \"not supportive\" of his daughter skipping school for the climate strike. Mr Thunberg said Greta was much happier since becoming an activist - but that he worries about the \"hate\" she faces. As part of the same broadcast, guest-edited by Greta for Radio 4's Today programme, Sir David Attenborough told her she had \"woken up the world\" to climate change. She called Sir David on Skype from Stockholm in Sweden, where she lives, and told him how he inspired her activism. The broadcaster and naturalist told Greta she had \"achieved things that many of us who have been working on the issue for 20 years have failed to do\". He added that the 16-year-old was the \"only reason\" that climate change became a key topic in the recent UK general election. Greta was nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, after spearheading a global movement demanding world leaders take action over climate change. It led to co-ordinated school strikes across the globe. She is among five high-profile people taking over the Today programme as guest editors during the festive period. The BBC flew presenter Mishal Husain to Sweden to interview the teenager and her father. On the decision to fly, Today editor Sarah Sands said: \"We just did not have time for other means of transport. But we met our cameraman there and the interview between Greta and David Attenborough was conducted by Skype, which felt the right way for the two of them to communicate.\" Struggle with depression Speaking to Husain as part of the show, Mr Thunberg said his daughter had struggled with depression for \"three or four years\" before she began her school strike. \"She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,\" he said. He added that it was the \"ultimate nightmare for a parent\" when Greta began refusing to eat. To help her get better, Mr Thunberg spent more time with Greta and her younger sister, Beata, at their home in Sweden. Greta's mother, opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant Malena Ernman, cancelled contracts so the whole family could be together. The family also sought help from doctors, Mr Thunberg said. Greta was diagnosed with Asperger's - a form of autism - aged 12, something she has said allows her to \"see things from outside the box\". Over the next few years they began discussing and researching climate change, with Greta becoming increasingly passionate about tackling the issue. As \"very active\" human rights advocates, Greta accused her parents of being \"huge hypocrites\", Mr Thunberg said. \"Greta said: 'Whose human rights are you standing up for?', since we were not taking this climate issue seriously,\" he explained. He said Greta got \"energy\" from her parents' changes in behaviour to become more environmentally friendly - such as her mother choosing not to travel by aeroplane and her father becoming vegan. Mr Thunberg has also accompanied his daughter on her sailing expeditions to UN climate summits in New York and Madrid. Greta refuses to travel by air because of its environmental impact. \"I did all these things, I knew they were the right thing to do... but I didn't do it to save the climate, I did it to save my child,\" Mr Thunberg said. \"I have two daughters and to be honest they are all that matter to me. I just want them to be happy,\" he added. Mr Thunberg said Greta has \"changed\" and become \"very happy\" as a result of her activism. \"You think she's not ordinary now because she's special, and she's very famous, and all these things. But to me she's now an ordinary child - she can do all the things like other people can,\" he said. \"She dances around, she laughs a lot, we have a lot of fun - and she's in a very good place.\" However, since Greta's school strike stunt went viral online, Mr Thunberg said she has faced abuse from people who \"don't want to change\" their lifestyles in order to save the environment. Greta has said previously that people abuse her for \"my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences\". Her father said he was particularly worried about \"the fake news, all the things that people try to fabricate her - the hate that that generates\". But he added that his daughter deals with the criticism \"incredibly well\". \"Quite frankly, I don't know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious.\" Mr Thunberg said he hoped things would become \"less intense\" for his family in the future and that he thinks Greta \"really wants to go back to school\". He added that as Greta turns 17 soon, she will no longer need to be accompanied on her travels. \"If she needs me there, I'll try to do it,\" he said. \"But I think she'll be, more and more, going to do it by herself which is great.\"",

Mr Geelani has been a central figure in political protests against Indian rule in Kashmir for decades. He was a legislator for over 15 years before resigning in 1989 to join anti-India protests. He played a prominent role in bringing several political and religious groups under the banner of All Parties Hurriyat Conference in 1993. He was later elected as the group's chairman. Mr Geelani is known for his strong opposition to holding any kind of dialogue with India.

    "text": "Researchers at Cambridge University used algorithms to predict religion, politics, race and sexual orientation. The research, published in the journal PNAS, forms surprisingly accurate personal portraits, researchers said. The findings should \"ring alarm bells\" for users, privacy campaigners said. The study used 58,000 volunteers who alongside their Facebook \"likes\" and demographic information also provided psychometric testing results - designed to highlight personality traits. The Facebook likes were fed into algorithms and matched with the information from the personality tests. The algorithms proved 88% accurate for determining male sexuality, 95% accurate in distinguishing African-American from Caucasian-American and 85% for differentiating Republican from Democrat. Christians and Muslims were correctly classified in 82% of cases and relationship status and substance abuse was predicted with an accuracy between 65% and 73%. The links clicked rarely explicitly revealed these attributes. Fewer than 5% of gay users clicked obvious likes such as gay marriage, for instance. Instead, the algorithms aggregated huge amounts of likes such as music and TV shows to create personal profiles. It also threw up some strange pairings. \"Curly fries correlated with high intelligence and people who liked the Dark Knight tended to have fewer Facebook friends,\" said research author David Stillwell. Data rethink The study will be music to the ears of social media firms keen to make more money from customers via personalised marketing. But the researchers warned that the digital profiles people are creating also threaten privacy. \"I appreciate automated book recommendations, or Facebook selecting the most relevant stories for my newsfeed. However, I can imagine situations in which the same data and technology is used to predict political views or sexual orientation, posing threats to freedom or even life,\" said Michael Kosinski, lead researcher on the project. There are simple things users can do, said Mr Stillwell. \"Facebook likes are public by default but it is not that Facebook is forcing you to make them public; you have a choice to change your privacy settings.\" He stressed that the results had implications beyond social media to all digital records - from browser histories to search queries. \"This research should ring alarm bells for anyone who thinks that privacy settings are the solution to protecting information online. We need to fundamentally re-think how much data we are voluntarily sharing,\" said Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch. \"Sharing individual likes or pages might not seem hugely intrusive, but it allows individuals to be categorised and behaviour predicted in areas that are far more personal and sensitive than people realise. \"Yet again, it is clear the lack of transparency about how users' data is being used will lead to entirely justified fears about our data being exploited for commercial gain.\"",

    "text": "The United States alleges that he conspired with Chelsea Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He could be jailed for up to five years. Since it launched in 2006, Wikileaks has become renowned for publishing thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and wars. The helicopter attack In 2010, Wikileaks published a video from a US military helicopter showing the killing of civilians in Baghdad, Iraq. A voice on the transmission urged the pilots to \"light 'em all up\" and the individuals on the street were fired at from the helicopter. When a van arrived on the scene to pick up the wounded, it too was fired at. Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen and his assistant Saeed Chmagh were both killed in the attack. US Army Intelligence Wikileaks has published hundreds of thousands of documents leaked by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Documents relating to the war in Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents. Further documents from the Iraq war revealed that 66,000 civilians had been killed - more than previously reported. The documents also showed that prisoners had been tortured by Iraqi forces. Among the leaks were more than 250,000 messages sent by US diplomats. They revealed that the US wanted to collect \"biographic and biometric\" information - including iris scans, DNA samples and fingerprints - of key officials at the UN. 9/11 pager messages About 573,000 intercepted pager messages sent during the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States were published by Wikileaks. The messages include families checking up on their loved ones and government departments reacting to the attacks. \"President has been rerouted won't be returning to Washington but not sure where he will go,\" one message said. Democrat emails Wikileaks published thousands of hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta, in the run-up to the US presidential election in 2016. In the emails, Mr Podesta called Mrs Clinton's election rival Bernie Sanders a \"doofus\" for criticising the Paris climate change agreement. The emails also suggested that a CNN contributor tipped off the Clinton campaign about a question that was going to be asked during a debate hosted by the broadcaster. The timing of the leaks led to accusations that Wikileaks was deliberately trying to discredit Mrs Clinton. The site also published leaked information from Republican Sarah Palin's Yahoo email accounts in 2008. British National Party members In 2008, Wikileaks published the names, addresses and contact information of more than 13,000 members of the British National Party. The political party's manifesto proposed banning immigration from Muslim countries and encouraging some UK residents to return to \"their lands of ethnic origin\". A former member was later fined £200 for the leak. The Sony Pictures hack A leak of more than 170,000 emails and 20,000 documents from movie studio Sony Pictures was published on Wikileaks in 2015. The entertainment company suffered a cyber-attack weeks before releasing The Interview, a film that poked fun at North Korea. The emails revealed that actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams received a lower fee than their male co-stars in American Hustle. There were also messages from producers and executives insulting celebrities such as Angelina Jolie. Leonardo DiCaprio was called \"despicable\" for turning down a role in a Sony Pictures film. Mr Assange said the emails were in the public interest because they showed the inner working of a multinational company and were \"at the centre of a geo-political conflict\".",

    "text": "In an interview ahead of his Asian tour, Mr Obama said the US would oppose any attempt to undermine Japan's control over the islands. US officials have made such comments in the past, but this is the first time Mr Obama has given such explicit support. He arrived in Japan on Wednesday ahead of stops in three other Asian nations. China's foreign ministry has said it opposes the islands being covered by the defence treaty. \"The so-called US-Japan alliance is a bilateral arrangement from the Cold War and ought not to harm China's territorial sovereignty and reasonable rights,\" spokesman Qin Gang said in Beijing during a regular press briefing. Mr Obama is not going to Beijing, but relations with China are expected to dominate his meetings with regional leaders. The trip was an opportunity to reinforce the importance the US placed on Asia, former US Assistant Secretary of State PJ Crowley told the BBC. \"Many traditional allies... [also] value a strong US presence in the region to balance against an assertive China,\" he said. The visit comes amid a \"period of very significant tension among American allies, and between American allies and China\", he added. 'Clear position' Mr Obama's trip - from 23-29 April - comes nearly seven months after he cancelled a visit to the region due to a government shutdown. He will have a private dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as well as bilateral meetings with the South Korean, Malaysian and Philippine leaders. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing were expected to be high on the agenda as Mr Obama touched down in Tokyo on Wednesday evening. Relations are severely strained over a raft of issues, including East China Sea islands - called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - that both claim. Japan controls the islands but Chinese ships have sailed repeatedly in and out of what Japan says are its territorial waters as Beijing presses its claim. Last year, China declared an air defence identification zone over the islands, drawing widespread criticism. Ahead of his visit, Mr Obama said in a written response to Japan's Yomiuri newspaper that the US opposed \"any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands\". \"The policy of the United States is clear - the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and therefore fall within the scope of Article 5 of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Co-operation and Security,\" he wrote. Japan depends on the US for its security, under a decades-old alliance that dates back to the end of World War Two. The US, however, is keen for Japan to take on greater responsibility for its own security - an area where Mr Obama and Mr Abe are likely to be in general agreement. The two leaders are also expected to discuss the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal which requires each country to strike an agreement with other prospective members. A rift between Japan and the US over agriculture product tariffs has proved a major sticking point. Nuclear test? Mr Obama is also expected to have to balance bolstering US ties with each Asian ally with improving communication among them, particularly between South Korea and Japan. The two Asian nations are at odds over a separate set of disputed islands, as well as historical issues linked to Japan's war history. The Japanese prime minister's views on World War Two have poisoned relations to the point where Tokyo and Seoul are now barely on speaking terms, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo. On Tuesday, Seoul accused Mr Abe of romanticising \"Japanese colonialism and its war of aggression\" after he sent an offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan's war dead - including convicted war criminals - are enshrined. But the US - which last month brokered a meeting of the Japanese and South Korean leaders - wants the two to co-operate on North Korea, amid long-term deadlock in moves to end Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. On Tuesday, South Korea's defence ministry said that it had detected \"a lot of activity\" at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea could be planning to hold a \"surprise nuclear test or just pretend to stage a nuclear test\", a spokesman said. Mr Obama arrives in Seoul on Friday. A state department spokeswoman said the US was \"closely monitoring the situation\". The test, if it went ahead, would be North Korea's fourth.",

    "text": "It said his human rights might be violated if he is sent to Sweden to be questioned over sex assault claims. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the UK would not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the country and the move was also criticised by Stockholm. Ecuador said it would seek to negotiate arrangements for Mr Assange to leave. \"We don't think it is reasonable that, after a sovereign government has made the decision of granting political asylum, a citizen is forced to live in an embassy for a long period,\" Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said. Mr Assange took refuge at the embassy in June to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning over assault and rape claims, which he denies. Mr Patino had accused the UK of making an \"open threat\" to enter its embassy to arrest Mr Assange, an Australian national. Mr Assange said being granted political asylum by Ecuador was a \"significant victory\" and thanked staff in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. However, as the Foreign Office insisted the decision would not affect the UK's legal obligation to extradite him to Sweden, Mr Assange warned: \"Things will get more stressful now.\" \"It was not Britain or my home country, Australia, that stood up to protect me from persecution, but a courageous, independent Latin American nation,\" said Mr Assange, who watched the announcement with embassy staff in a live link to a press conference in Quito. \"While today is a historic victory, our struggles have just begun. The unprecedented US investigation against Wikileaks must be stopped. \"While today much of the focus will be on the decision of the Ecuadorean government, it is just as important that we remember Bradley Manning has been detained without trial for over 800 days,\" he said, referring to the former US soldier accused of leaking government material to Wikileaks. Mr Assange is expected to make a statement in front of the embassy on Sunday at 14:00 BST, according to the Wikileaks Twitter feed. 'Legal obligation' Announcing Ecuador's decision, Mr Patino launched a strong attack on the UK for what he said was an \"explicit type of blackmail\". The UK Foreign Office had warned, in a note, that it could lift the embassy's diplomatic status to fulfil a \"legal obligation\" to extradite the 41-year-old by using the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987. That allows the UK to revoke the diplomatic status of an embassy on UK soil, which would potentially allow police to enter the building to arrest Mr Assange for breaching the terms of his bail. Mr Hague said it was a \"matter of regret\" that the Ecuadorean government decided to grant Mr Assange political asylum but warned that it \"does not change the fundamentals\" of the case. He also warned that it could drag on for some \"considerable\" time. \"We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom, nor is there any legal basis for us to do so,\" he said. Mr Hague said there was \"no threat\" to storm the embassy. \"We are talking about an Act of Parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law,\" he said. Mr Patino said Ecuador believed Mr Assange's fears of political persecution were \"legitimate\" and said his country was being loyal to its tradition of protecting those who were vulnerable. He later told BBC Mundo that conditions were attached to the asylum. \"We placed the same type of conditions that are the norm in international relations, such as him [Mr Assange] not making political statements that could affect our relations with friendly countries.\" The Foreign Office said it was \"disappointed\" by the Ecuador statement and said it remained committed to reaching a \"negotiated solution\" that would allow it to carry out its \"obligations under the Extradition Act\". This means Mr Assange's arrest would still be sought if he left the embassy. Sweden summons ambassador The Swedish government reacted angrily to Mr Patino's suggestion that Mr Assange would not be treated fairly by its justice system, summoning Ecuador's ambassador to explain. \"The accusations... are serious, and it is unacceptable that Ecuador would want to halt the Swedish judicial process and European judicial co-operation,\" said Anders Joerle, spokesman for the Swedish foreign ministry. The Organisation of American States called a special meeting at its Washington headquarters on Thursday to discuss the Ecuador-UK relationship, specifically Ecuador's diplomatic premises in the UK. The Union of South American Nations, meanwhile, has convened an \"extraordinary meeting\" in Ecuador on Sunday to consider \"the situation raised at the embassy\". Mr Assange entered the embassy after the UK's Supreme Court dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition and gave him a two-week grace period before extradition proceedings could start. It was during that fortnight, while on bail, that he sought refuge. A subsequent offer by Ecuador to allow Swedish investigators to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy was rejected. The Wikileaks website Mr Assange founded published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments, particularly that of the US, in 2010. Mr Assange says he fears that if extradited to Sweden, he will then be passed on to the American authorities. In 2010, two female Wikileaks supporters accused Mr Assange of committing sexual offences against them while he was in Stockholm to give a lecture. Mr Assange claims the sex was consensual and the allegations are politically motivated.",

    "text": "By Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi He didn't get tested for coronavirus. Instead he took anti-fever medication for five days. But the fever persisted, and soon he had difficulty breathing. His family asked him to get tested, but he refused. His rationale was that there was no way he could have contracted Covid-19 because he had hardly stepped out of his house in Delhi, and he had not met anybody who had the virus or was even suspected of having it. Eight days after the symptoms first appeared, his condition deteriorated. He was rushed to hospital, where he tested positive. \"I survived, but doctors told me that any more delay in hospitalisation could have cost me my life,\" he says. Mr Kumar hasn't been able to track the source of his infection and is still unsure how he caught it. Experts say there are many such cases - proof that \"full-blown\" community transmission is happening in India. But the government refuses to accept that community transmission has begun, saying there is no clear definition of the term, and each country can define it based on local conditions. So far, Kerala and West Bengal are the only two states to accept that they have entered this stage. But global understanding on the subject is simple: when the source of infection can't be traced in a large number of cases, it's safe to define it as community transmission. The WHO's guidelines say the same: \"community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases\". This is certainly happening in India, according to Dr Arvind Kumar, chairman of the Centre for Chest Surgery at Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital. He says that more and more patients are turning up at hospitals whose source of infection cannot be traced. And, he adds, the rising case numbers support this. India has recorded more than 1.2 million cases and nearly 29,000 deaths. \"These stats don't lie,\" Dr Kumar says. \"You have state after state where infection rates are going up rapidly. There is no point in denying what is right in front of you.\" But the government disagrees. A top doctor from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) recently acknowledged that India was in the community transmission phase, but the IMA retracted the statement two days later, saying it was the doctor's \"personal opinion\". The turnaround baffled many. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says the government needs to listen to doctors and experts, and acknowledge the evidence. There is no denying that the virus is more widespread now than a month ago. More states - such as Andhra Pradesh and Bihar - and more districts beyond dense urban areas are now reporting a surge in cases. Many of them were not prepared because they largely relied on quarantining and testing people coming from other states to halt the spread. But they did not take enough steps to curb the spread locally. Even the former strategy had gaps, because it's not possible to completely man porous borders between states. And many states also lack the means to track and test each person entering their territory. Dr Jameel adds that there was a sense that the virus could be contained within big cities and certain hotspot states, preventing it from reaching other parts of the country. \"That hasn't happened and now Covid-19 is spreading unchecked,\" he says. The virus is travelling fast, often leaving no trace to establish the chain of transmission. Dr Jameel points out that the government's own survey showed that 40% of the respondents who had respiratory illnesses did not know how they got sick. \"We have enough evidence to accept there is community transmission,\" he says. But experts say this didn't happen overnight. Rather, it happened over several weeks as the government continued to deny it. \"We had localised community transmission in early stages of the pandemic. But now it's spread across the country, it's there for everybody to see,\" Dr Kumar says. So why is the government so reluctant to accept the obvious? Experts say they \"can only guess\" since the government hasn't said much on the matter, and has not released an official definition of the term to support its stance. One reason could be that the government sees accepting the existence of community transmission as a failure of its policies. The government can't be blamed for community transmission, argues Dr Jameel, adding that it needs to be more forthright with data and accept what science proves. He adds that community transmission is often a possibility with such a highly infectious virus in densely populated countries like India. Denials only add more pressure, say experts, and spark an unnecessary debate around the topic. And the argument is pointless now, according to leading epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant, who has worked with the government. He says \"we have to keep improving our strategy\", whether we call it community transmission or not. \"India is a large country - you may control the virus in one state and then another state will flare up. So, we really don't need a definition to understand the ground reality,\" he says. \"It's getting worse, and that is the harsh truth.\" But accepting community transmission may require significant policy changes. The WHO says \"individual case identification, contact tracing, and quarantining are no longer necessary\" in a \"large-scale community transmission scenario\". Instead it advises countries to focus on tracking the geographical spread of the virus through data and deploy healthcare facilities accordingly. Dr Kant says it's possible that the government may not want to announce a shift in policy at the moment. Possibly because it's taken months for governments - both federal and state - to ramp up testing, and to implement test and trace protocols. The other challenge is that the pandemic is in different stages in different parts of India, which makes it difficult to overhaul the policy altogether. \"But it still doesn't justify their constant denials. They need to say what their long-term approach is or what their definitions are about community transmission,\" he adds.

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Among the residents are Bengali- and Assamese-speaking Hindus, and a medley of tribespeople. A third of its 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh has been a concern for decades now. A six-year indigenous protest - during which hundreds of people were murdered - led to a 1985 pact between the federal government and protesters. It was agreed that anyone who entered Assam without proper documentation after 24 March 1971 would be declared a foreigner. Now, the publication of the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC) reveals, according to officials, that some four million of Assam's residents are illegal foreigners. Separate specially-formed courts in the last few years had already declared as foreigners some 1,000 residents - mostly Bengali-speaking Muslims - and interned them in half-a-dozen detention camps. In an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. Stripped of their Indian citizenship, the affected people in Assam, many of whom have lived there for decades, will be suddenly unable to vote, access welfare or own property. Those who already own property could easily become targets of envious neighbours. At a time when the UN refugee agency is vowing to end statelessness - there are some 10 million stateless people in the world - this will be a major embarrassment for India. Mr Modi's government has already shown nervousness. A senior minister said people not listed on the NRC would not be kept in detention camps and would be given a last chance to prove their citizenship by the end of the year. At the same time, there are plans to build a vast, new detention camp for people who are unable to prove their citizenship. Also, according to lawyers, people whose names are not on the list can appeal to the special courts. It could take years, if not decades, to decide on the fate of tens of thousands of people. \"In short, this is a complete mess of affairs,\" says Subir Bhaumik, author of Troubled Periphery, a study of India's troubled north-east. \"The potential for chaos is huge. There will be panic among the minorities. Bangladesh will fear an influx of new refugees. Detention camps packed with stateless people will invite international attention, and bleed the exchequer.\" There's little doubt that illegal migration is a serious issue for Assam. Its population has grown at a much higher rate than in the rest of India, raising suspicions of substantial informal migration across the porous borders it shares with Bangladesh. Thousands fled to Assam during the 1971 war with Pakistan. This has hurt the state in more ways than one: land ownership has declined, plot sizes have shrunk and landlessness has risen. Estimates of illegal foreigners range from four million to 10 million. Most of them are engaged in farm work. According to one estimate, they have a sizeable presence in 15 of Assam's 33 districts. Some 100 special courts have already declared more than 85,000 people foreigners since 1985. But many argue that Mr Modi's BJP has whipped up religious tension over the crisis for electoral gain - the party says illegal Muslims should be deported while illegal Hindus can remain. \"Rightly or wrongly the citizenship issue has become a crucial talking point and an issue in Assam politics. Unless it is settled, you cannot go forward,\" says Hiren Gohain, a leading Assamese author and social scientist. \"Who are the genuine citizens in the state and who are the aliens needs to be ascertained.\" A hastily executed citizenship test which has cost India $180m (£137m) so far and has ended up fanning xenophobia and distrust surely cannot be the answer.",

Mehsud was killed when missiles struck his vehicle in the North Waziristan region on 1 November. The government had been trying to set up peace talks, but the new leader has already rejected the initiative. The BBC's Richard Galpin in Islamabad says the Taliban have indicated that Mullah Fazlullah wants revenge for the killing of Mehsud. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC the militants would target the military and the governing party. The Mehsud killing had angered the Pakistani government. Interior Minister Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan said that the drone strike was \"not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts\". Mehsud clan The announcement of the new leader was made by the Taliban's caretaker leader Asmatullah Shaheen at a news conference at an undisclosed location. When the news was announced, there was reportedly heavy celebratory gunfire in the area around Miranshah, the main town in the tribal area of North Waziristan. Mullah Fazlullah led a brutal campaign in Swat between 2008 and 2009, enforcing hardline Islamic law, that included burning schools, and public floggings and beheadings. A military operation was launched to retake the area. Mullah Fazlullah fled over the border into Afghanistan but Islamabad says he has continued to orchestrate attacks in Pakistan. He was accused of being behind a roadside bomb in September that killed Maj Gen Sanaullah Niazi, the top commander in Swat, along with two other military personnel. Mullah Fazlullah was known for his radio broadcasts calling for strict Islamic laws and earning him the nickname \"Mullah Radio\". The shooting of Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 sparked outrage in Pakistan and across the globe. The teenager had spoken out against the Taliban's restrictions on girls' education. She was airlifted to the UK for hospital treatment and now lives in Birmingham with her family. This year Malala, now 16, addressed the UN General Assembly and won the European Union's Sakharov human rights prize. Prior to the latest Taliban announcement, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad said that Mullah Fazlullah was not a member of the Mehsud clan and, if appointed, would face a challenge to control the Mehsud fighters, who make up the bulk of the Taliban's manpower. The Taliban's ruling council took seven days to reach a decision. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come to power in May pledging a negotiated settlement to the insurgency, but militant attacks continued. The government said a delegation had been due to fly to North Waziristan to discuss peace talks with Hakimullah Mehsud but he was killed in the drone strike the day before. There had been some hope a new leader of the Taliban would be more open to the peace initiative. Regional Taliban commander Khan Said Sajna, said to favour such a move, had been touted as a favourite before the latest announcement.",

Her lawyer, Robert Offer, said the decision had been made \"for the health of the family\". It is understood Jolie is seeking physical custody of the couple's six children and asking the judge to give Pitt visitation rights. Speculation is mounting over the causes behind the split, with one newspaper claiming Jolie was \"upset with Pitt's parenting skills\". Ms Jolie's long-time manager Geyser Kosinski told E! Online: \"Angelina will always do what's in the best interest of taking care of her family.\" Madame Tussauds in London marked the split by announcing on Twitter that its mannequins of the pair have been separated. Twlight actor Robert Pattinson appears to have been placed between them. Pitt and Jolie - nicknamed \"Brangelina\" by fans - married in 2014, 10 years after meeting on the set of 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith. It was Pitt's second marriage, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. Singer Adele is among those to comment on the split, dedicating a concert in New York on Tuesday to the Hollywood couple. The 28-year-old told an audience at Madison Square Garden she had been \"shocked\" by the news and that it felt \"like the end of an era\". Jon Voight, Jolie's actor father, also expressed sadness, saying whatever caused the split \"must have been pretty severe\". George Clooney, who worked with Pitt on Ocean's Eleven and its sequels, expressed surprise when asked about the matter. \"I feel very sorry to hear that,\" he told reporters at a United Nations event. \"It's an unfortunate story about a family.\" Billy Bob Thornton, however, made no comment at a Hollywood event honouring actress Kathy Bates on Tuesday. The actor, who was married to Jolie from 2000 to 2003, left quickly afterwards, avoiding questions from waiting reporters. Pitt and Jolie most recently worked together on 2015 film By the Sea, a relationship drama about a couple trying to repair their marriage.

Andreas Kruppert, mayor of the municipality of Arzfeld, said zookeepers lost track of the big cats during the storm but later located them, still in their enclosures, with the help of a drone. \"We are very happy that the scenario we had initially feared didn't turn out to be the case,\" he told a news conference. Mr Kruppert said the decision to shoot the bear was made to protect the public. \"As a result of serious flooding the high water pressure on the gate [of the bear enclosure] meant that it gave way,\" he said. \"As a result, and also in an effort to save itself from the rising water, the bear fled the enclosure on to the path.

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent It runs a massive immunisation programme, makes 60% of the world's vaccines and is home to half a dozen major manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India - the largest in the world. Not surprisingly, there's no lack of ambition when it comes to vaccinating a billion people against Covid-19. India plans to receive and utilise some 500 million doses of vaccines against the disease and immunise up to 250 million people by July next year. This confidence is bolstered by its track record of immunising large numbers of people every year. India's 42-year-old immunisation programme, one of the world's largest health programmes, targets 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year. The country also has a well-oiled electronic system to stock and track these vaccines. Yet vaccinating a billion people, including hundreds of millions of adults for the first time, against Covid-19 is going to be a daunting and unprecedented challenge, say experts. Five of the 30 vaccine candidates being developed in India are in clinical trials. They include the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which is being tested by Serum and a home-grown one being developed by Bharat BioTech. \"Having a home-grown vaccine is a top priority,\" Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology, told me. From choosing a bouquet of vaccines to grappling with distribution to identifying groups for the early jabs, \"everything is a challenge\", says Dr Gagandeep Kang, a microbiologist and the first Indian woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. \"We are underestimating the complexity of the exercise. It will take at least a couple of years to get half of Indians vaccinated.\" Here are some of the main challenges: Supply chain and logistics India has some 27,000 \"cold chain\" stores from where stocked vaccines can reach more than eight million locations. (Nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain.) Will that be enough? India will also need enough auto-disabled syringes that will prevent reuse and possible reinfection. The country's biggest syringe maker says it will be making a billion such syringes by next year to meet rising demand. Then there are questions about smooth supplies of medical glass vials. And what about the disposal of the huge amount of medical waste that will be generated by this mass vaccination drive? Nearly four million doctors and nurses power India's immunisation programme, but India will need more to carry out Covid vaccinations. \"I worry about how we can [extend all the resources] to rural India,\" Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, founder of Biocon, the country's leading biotechnology enterprise, told me. Who's going to get the early jabs? Vaccine supplies will be tight next year, and deciding who will get the jabs first is going to be tricky. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan says private and government health care workers and frontline workers \"of other departments\" will receive the early doses. Experts believe it's not going to be easy. \"We will never have sufficient supply of vaccines. The prioritisation of recipients is going to be a considerable challenge,\" says epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Consider this. In a country where the majority of healthcare is private, will a private health worker get priority over a public one? Will permanent workers get priority over people working on contracts? If elderly people with underlying conditions are eligible for early shots, how will different co-morbidities be prioritised? India, for example, has more than 70 million diabetics, the second highest in the world. Will all of them be given a blanket preference? Rolling out the vaccine in all the 30 states will not be possible. So will early supplies go to states worst-hit by the pandemic? Questions about equity and non-partisanship are inevitable. Tracking millions of doses Stitching up manufacturing contracts with vaccine makers with a \"reasonably good portfolio\" of vaccines should help India give sufficient doses to people relatively quickly, according to Prashant Yadav, who studies health care supply chains at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development. But the success at routine immunisation doesn't guarantee success with Covid-19 vaccines, he says. \"The routine immunisation infrastructure has a huge footprint, but is mostly for government-run clinics. There is no large-scale adult vaccination programme and adults don't routinely seek primary care in government public health care centres,\" says Dr Yadav. A well-regulated public-private partnership is the only way out this time, he adds. People like Ms Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of Infosys, one of India's biggest information technology services companies, suggest that India should use Aadhaar, the unique 12-digit identification number that over a billion Indians use to access welfare and pay taxes, to record and track each dose. \"We need to design a system than can do 10 million vaccinations a day across the length and breadth of the country but all unified by a digital backbone,\" Mr Nilekani told a newspaper. Fraud over access Some of the concerns are about corruption over access to vaccines. How do authorities prevent fraud such as people getting fake papers to include themselves in lists of people who are selected for early shots? And how do you prevent fake vaccines being sold in remote markets? Read more stories by Soutik Biswas Monitoring for 'adverse events' Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \"adverse events\" following immunisation. But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak and the number of serious adverse events are still far less than the expected numbers. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines. Who will pay for it? This is possibly the biggest question. Will the government acquire all the doses and roll out a state-run free or subsidised vaccination programme? Or will the affluent pay for their doses at market prices through private distribution and sale? Experts like Dr Lahariya believe that the government should be footing the bill for vaccinating every Indian until the pandemic is over. Others like Dr Shaw say that private firms could pay to vaccinate their employees. Mr Nilekani reckons that with vaccines costing between $3 and $5 (£2.24 and £3.74) in the beginning, a dual dose vaccine could cost up to $10 for each Indian and $13bn for India. That would be very expensive. That's why, says Gagandeep Kang, a good vaccine for India should cost below 50 cents a shot, be plentifully available and delivered as a single dose.

    "text": "By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website The analysis reveals that dog domestication can be traced back 11,000 years, to the end of the last Ice Age. This confirms that dogs were domesticated before any other known species. Our canine companions were widespread across the northern hemisphere at this time, and had already split into five different types. Despite the expansion of European dogs during the colonial era, traces of these ancient indigenous breeds survive today in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The research fills in some of the gaps in the natural history of our close animal companions. Dr Pontus Skoglund, co-author of the study and group leader of the Ancient Genomics laboratory at London's Crick Institute, told BBC News: \"Dogs are really unique in being this quite strange thing if you think about it, when all people were still hunter gatherers, they domesticate what is really a wild carnivore - wolves are pretty frightening in many parts of the world. \"The question of why did people do that? How did that come about? That's what we're ultimately interested in.\" To some extent, dog genetic patterns mirror human ones, because people took their animal companions with them when they moved. But there were also important differences. For example, early European dogs were initially diverse, appearing to originate from two very distinct populations, one related to Near Eastern dogs and another to Siberian dogs. But at some point, perhaps after the onset of the Bronze Age, a single dog lineage spread widely and replaced all other dog populations on the continent. This pattern has no counterpart in the genetic patterns of people from Europe. Anders Bergström, lead author and post-doctoral researcher at the Crick, said: \"If we look back more than four or five thousand years ago, we can see that Europe was a very diverse place when it came to dogs. Although the European dogs we see today come in such an extraordinary array of shapes and forms, genetically they derive from only a very narrow subset of the diversity that used to exist.\" An international team analysed the whole genomes (the full complement of DNA in the nuclei of biological cells) of 27 ancient dog remains associated with a variety of archaeological cultures. They compared these to each other and to modern dogs. The results reveal that breeds like the Rhodesian Ridgeback in southern Africa and the Chihuahua and Xoloitzcuintli in Mexico retain genetic traces of ancient indigenous dogs from the region. The ancestry of dogs in East Asia is complex. Chinese breeds seem to derive some of their ancestry from animals like the Australian dingo and New Guinea singing dog, with the rest coming from Europe and dogs from the Russian steppe. The New Guinea singing dog is so named because of its melodious howl, characterised by a sharp increase in pitch at the start. Greger Larson, a co-author from the University of Oxford, said: \"Dogs are our oldest and closest animal partner. Using DNA from ancient dogs is showing us just how far back our shared history goes and will ultimately help us understand when and where this deep relationship began.\" Dogs are thought to have evolved from wolves that ventured into human camps, perhaps sniffing around for food. As they were tamed, they could then have served humans as hunting companions or guards. The results suggest all dogs derive from a single extinct wolf population - or perhaps a few very closely related ones. If there were multiple domestication events around the world, these other lineages did not contribute much DNA to later dogs. Dr Skoglund said it was unclear when or where the initial domestication occurred. \"Dog history has been so dynamic that you can't really count on it still being there to readily read in their DNA. We really don't know - that's the fascinating thing about it.\" Many animals, such as cats, probably became our pets when humans settled down to farm a little over 6,000 years ago. Cats were probably useful for controlling pests such as mice, that were attracted by the waste generated by dense settlements. This places their domestication in cradles of agriculture such as the Near East. \"For dogs, it could almost have been anywhere: cold Siberia, the warm Near East, South-East Asia. All of these are possibilities in my mind,\" Pontus Skoglund explained. The findings have been published in the journal Science. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

    "text": "By Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News As it rose, during this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite turned a striking shade of red or ruddy brown. The \"totality\" period, where light from the Moon was totally obscured, lasted for one hour, 43 minutes. At least part of the eclipse was visible from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, most of Asia and South America. In the UK, where the weather allowed, the Moon could be seen to turn red - fully eclipsed by Earth - from when it rose at 21:00 until 22:15 BST. Over the coming days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 - visible as a \"bright red star\" where skies are clear. Why did the eclipse last so long? The Moon passed right through the centre of the Earth's shadow, at the shadow's widest point. \"This is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be,\" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist at University of Manchester, explained. It coincided not only with Mars's close approach, but with what he described as a \"procession of planets\" - a line-up of our celestial neighbours that gave skywatchers a particularly good view of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. Eclipse terms Umbra: The darker, central part of the Earth's shadow Penumbra: The lighter, outer part of the shadow cast by our planet Because the Moon is far away from Earth relatively speaking - its orbit is an ellipse, so it moves closer and further and looks larger and smaller from Earth. Mars could also be seen as a bright red star just below the Moon. \"Every couple of years or so, the Earth overtakes Mars on the inside as it orbits the Sun, so Mars is closest to us,\" said Prof O'Brien. \"And because of the elliptical shape of the orbit, it's even closer than normal.\" Where was the eclipse visible? Where skies were free of cloud, the spectacle was visible almost everywhere around the world, with the exception of North America. The eclipse had already started by the time the Moon rose over the UK and Western Europe. People in the UK needed a clear south-eastern horizon as the Moon came up in order to see it. The best views - where the weather permitted - were across Eastern Europe, Central and East Africa and South East Asia, from where the entire eclipse was visible. So, from the UK and Europe, the south-east was the place to look for the rising, eclipsing Moon with a bright red Mars below. Jupiter could also be seen in the southern sky and Venus in the west. Dr Emily Brunsden, director of the University of York's Astrocampus, added that this eclipse was a \"micro blood moon\". \"This is a total eclipse at a time in its orbit when it is close to being the farthest from Earth, or at apogee,\" she said. \"Hence the Moon was fractionally smaller than usual.\" Stages of a total lunar eclipse Source: timeanddate.com Did you see the \"blood moon\"?

    "text": "Two women - journalist Kavitha Jagdal and social activist Rehana Fathima - managed to reach the main temple premises on Thursday. More than 100 policemen protected them from stone-throwing protesters as they walked the last 5km (3-mile) stretch to the temple. But they had to return after a stand-off with devotees metres from Sabarimala's sanctum. The protesters have also included many women - they have participated in rallies, blocked roads and checked vehicles heading towards the temple to see if any women of a \"menstruating age\" - deemed to be those aged between 10 and 50 years - were trying to enter. The temple attracts millions of devotees from across the country every year. Why are protesters so angry? Part of the violent opposition to the Supreme Court order to reverse the temple's historical ban on women is because protesters feel the ruling goes against the wishes of the deity, Lord Ayappa, himself. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. But while most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it was one of the few that did not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. Hindu devotees say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. Every year, millions of male devotees trek up a steep hill, often barefoot, to visit the shrine. They also undertake a rigorous 41-day fast, abstaining from smoking, alcohol, meat, sex and contact with menstruating women before they begin the journey. What is the legend of Lord Ayappa? Every god in the vast Hindu pantheon has his or her own personality, complete with a unique legend, and Lord Ayappa is no different. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy. There are several stories about why this is the case. According to one legend, Ayappa was born out of a union between two male gods which gave him the ability to defeat a she-demon who had been unstoppable until then. Upon defeating her, it was revealed that she was really a young woman who had been cursed to live the life of a demon. She fell in love with him and asked him to marry her, but he refused, saying he was destined to go into the forest and answer the prayers of his devotees. She persisted, so he said he would marry her the day new devotees stopped coming to seek his blessings. That never happened. The legend says that she waits for him at a second temple, which lies on the way to the main Sabarimala shrine. Women do not visit either temple - the belief is that to do so would insult both the deity and the sacrifice of the woman who loved him. According to another legend, Lord Ayappa was a prince who saved his kingdom from an Arab invader named Vavar. Following the battle, Vavar became a devout follower of the prince - there is also a shrine dedicated to him near Sabarimala. He is said to protect the pilgrims who come to Sabarimala to seek blessings. In this version of the story, Lord Ayappa eventually took a vow to answer the prayers of every devotee who came to him, and shunned all worldly desires including contact with women, which is why women are not permitted inside his temple. There could also be other legends associated with the deity and why women are not allowed inside. What are protesters saying? \"There is no jubilation among Hindu women devotees; on the contrary, they are distressed,\" author Vineetha Menon wrote in the Organiser - a publication run by the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has been at the forefront of protests. Ms Menon argues that women do not enter the temple \"owing to the Lord's bhava [wish]\". Some male devotees have said that they will not return to the temple if the court ruling is enforced. \"We have been coming to temple for the last 30 years. But we may not come back because women entering the temple will spoil our belief system and sacred rituals,\" Murugan, a devotee, told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi. The issue also divided the five-judge bench that gave the verdict. Indu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, disagreed with the majority verdict. \"Issues of deep religious sentiments should not be ordinarily interfered by the court... Notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion,\" she said in her dissenting opinion. Women have been demanding entry into the temple for decades. But in 2016, a controversial statement by the temple's chief gave fresh impetus to the protest. Prayar Gopalakrishnan said that he would allow women to enter only after a machine was invented to detect if they were \"pure\" - meaning that they weren't menstruating. Petitioners who appealed before the Supreme Court to lift the ban cited his statement, saying the temple's rituals violated equality guaranteed under India's constitution. They added that it was prejudiced against women and their right to worship. Correspondents say that clashes between protesters and police may escalate in the coming days as more women are likely to attempt to enter the temple.",

    "text": "A document, inviting expressions of interest, was released on Monday. It says that any bidder would have to take on around $3.2bn (£2.4bn) of debt along with other liabilities. The announcement comes more than a year after a bid to sell a controlling stake in the airline did not attract buyers. The divestment of Air India has been a key agenda of the Indian government, which has been trying to offload loss-making companies and improve its balance sheet in the face of the slowest economic growth in a decade. Air India sale fails to attract buyers For years, Air India has blamed high aviation fuel prices, high airport usage charges, competition from low-cost carriers, weakening of the rupee, as well as a high interest burden for its poor financial performance. What is the government offering? Most significantly, it is offering a 100% stake in the airline. In 2018, it only offered potential buyers a 76% stake in the business. This was seen as a factor that put off potential buyers at the time. \"This is a very welcome change from last time to entice private players to bid for the carrier,\" Jitendra Bhargava, former Executive Director of Air India and author of the book, The Descent of Air India, told the BBC's Nikhil Inamdar. Air India has 146 aircraft and owns 56% of its total fleet. It is also known to have lucrative international and domestic landing and parking slots. But the carrier has continuously lost market share over the last decade as it saw growing competition from low-cost rivals. The airline has a large debt overhang, with liabilities exceeding over $8bn. But bidders will be expected to take on debt only to the tune of $3.26 billion according to the new terms. It is not yet clear what the government will do with the remaining debt. \"This could be a challenge because it is a very large portion of the debt to be taken care of when you consider that they have repayment schedules over eight to 10 years on around 70 aircraft,\" said Mahantesh Sabarad, head of Retail Research at SBICAP Securities. \"Buyers will also need to infuse substantial funds into the airline, so we expect the start-up costs for anyone getting into this to be high.\" Experts are also concerned that restructuring Air India's employee base of 14,000 plus people could be a challenge. \"I am concerned that the government hasn't reached out substantively to its critics, which includes employee unions and politicians,\" Mr Bhargava said. The Economic Times newspaper has already reported that some of the employee unions are holding a meeting in Delhi later today to discuss the move.

    "text": "The work, in the European Heart Journal, is further evidence against the idea people can be \"fat but fit\". The researchers studied health data on more than half a million people in 10 European countries, including the UK. Normal blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels were no assurance of good heart health among obese people. After a follow-up period of more than 12 years, 7,637 of the people in the study had developed heart disease. Weight appeared to be a risk factor. In the study, people who were overweight or obese but had healthy blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol readings were about 28% more likely to develop heart disease than individuals with similar readings and a healthy bodyweight. Being fat and \"metabolically unhealthy\" - having high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar - was riskier still. Are you a healthy weight for your height? The researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge say the findings are a reminder that carrying too much fat can store up health problems for the future. Dr Ioanna Tzoulaki, from Imperial's School of Public Health, said: \"I think there is no longer this concept of healthy obese. \"If anything, our study shows that people with excess weight who might be classed as 'healthy' haven't yet developed an unhealthy metabolic profile. \"That comes later in the timeline, then they have an event, such as a heart attack.\" According to the researchers, the excess weight itself may not be increasing the risk of heart disease directly, but rather over time through mechanisms such as increased blood pressure and high glucose. Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research, said: \"The take-home message here is that maintaining a healthy body weight is a key step towards maintaining a healthy heart.\"",

    "text": "The warship was discovered 18,000 feet (5.5km) beneath the surface. The Indianapolis was destroyed returning from its secret mission to deliver parts for the atomic bomb which was later used on Hiroshima. Of the 1,196 men on board, just 316 were rescued - the largest loss of life at sea in the history of the US Navy. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who led the civilian search team, said the discovery was \"truly humbling\". The USS Indianapolis was destroyed on 30 July 1945 when, somewhere in the Philippine sea between Guam and Leyte, it was hit by a torpedo from a Japanese submarine. Between 800-900 escaped the sinking ship. But no distress call was ever received, and by the time the survivors were found by chance four days later, just 316 were left alive in the shark-infested waters. The ship's rapid sinking - in just 12 minutes - and the lack of a distress call meant the ship's location had long been a mystery. Mr Allen's crew discovered the vessel on 18 August, after new research from a naval historian pointed them to a specific region of the ocean where the warship had been sighted the night before its destruction. The ship is well-known for its final, secret mission, carrying parts for the atomic bomb nicknamed \"Little Boy\" as well as enriched uranium fuel for its nuclear reaction. Those supplies were delivered to Tinian island, an American base in the final year of the war which launched the world's first nuclear bombing. Four days later, the Indianapolis sank - less than a week before the nuclear bomb it helped to make destroyed Hiroshima in the final days of World War Two. \"To be able to honour the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role during World War Two is truly humbling,\" Mr Allen said. \"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances.\" The USS Indianapolis remains the property of the US Navy, the search team's statement said. It will now be considered a protected war memorial. A spokesman for the survivors, 22 of whom are still alive, said each of them had \"longed for the day when their ship would be found\". Mr Allen's specially-outfitted research vessel, the Petrel, has been designed for exploration and research with a crew of 16. It previously discovered the wreckage of both a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the World War Two era.",

    "text": "It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. The Taliban said it would stop all offensive operations during the holiday, except against foreign forces. Earlier, Taliban fighters killed dozens of Afghan security force members. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the Taliban move was an opportunity for the militants to realise \"their violent campaign\" was \"not winning them hearts and minds but further alienating the Afghan people from their cause\". Government forces will not stop fighting other militants operating in Afghanistan, like the Islamic State (IS) group, during the ceasefire. Previous offers of peace talks and ceasefires with the Taliban have come to nothing. Why now? The Afghan government's unconditional truce followed a meeting of clerics, who earlier this week issued a fatwa condemning militant violence as un-Islamic. The clerics were themselves targeted in a suicide attack claimed by IS, which killed 14 people outside their peace tent in Kabul this week. The Taliban did not specify why they made the surprise decision to agree to the truce in their statement, but they said they would consider releasing prisoners of war as long they did not return to fighting against them. However, the group warned that it would \"strongly defend\" itself if it came under attack. Afghan officials hailed the Taliban's move to join the ceasefire. The UN special representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, said he hoped it would \"serve as as stepping stone\" towards peace talks. When will it actually happen? No exact date has been given. It is timed to coincide with Eid-al-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Afghan calendars mark the end of Ramadan as 15 June. What about foreign forces? In Washington, the state department said US forces and coalition partners in Afghanistan would \"honour the ceasefire\". Foreign troop levels in the country have dropped to about 15,000. Last August, US President Donald Trump unveiled a more hawkish strategy in Afghanistan, including a surge of air strikes and committing more troops. Their presence has been a major sticking point for the Taliban, who have long demanded they completely withdraw from the country as a pre-condition for peace talks to begin. The Nato combat mission, which at one point numbered more than 130,000 troops, withdrew from Afghanistan in 2014. What's the latest on the ground? News of the forthcoming truce has not prevented further violent incidents across Afghanistan. On Saturday alone, more than 60 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in separate Taliban attacks: Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001. How much territory do the Taliban control? The militants have made substantial territorial gains across the country since the withdrawal of thousands of troops in 2014, with security incidents at their highest level in more than 10 years. A BBC study from January found the Taliban are openly active in 70% of Afghanistan and now control or threaten more territory than before the foreign troops left. The same research found that IS was also more active, but is not as powerful as the Taliban. Who are the Taliban? The hardline Islamic Taliban movement swept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and was ousted by the US-led invasion five years later In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life. Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted. Since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today. In 2016, Afghan civilian casualties hit a new high - a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban.",

    "text": "But he said his treatment by the press over the photographs was not \"acceptable\", as he was at a party where he had expected privacy. The images of the prince were published on the web and by the Sun last August. The 28-year-old was speaking just before he completed a four-month deployment to Afghanistan in his role as an Apache helicopter pilot. The pictures of Prince Harry and a young woman naked appeared on US website TMZ - which reported that he had been playing \"strip billiards\" after inviting friends back to his hotel room for a private party. The Sun printed the photos, despite warnings from the Royal Family's lawyers that it would be an invasion of the prince's privacy. However, a complaint was later dropped by St James' Palace on the grounds that it would be a distraction for Harry as he began his second deployment to Afghanistan. It is the first time Harry, who was speaking from Camp Bastion, the main British military base in Afghanistan, has talked in public about the Las Vegas incident. He said: \"At the end of the day I probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down. \"But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.\" He added: \"It was probably a classic example of me probably being too much Army and not enough prince. It's a simple case of that.\" He said some people considered it a chance for \"letting off steam\" ahead of his Afghanistan deployment. \"Well, the papers knew I was going out to [Afghanistan] anyway, so the way I was treated from them, I don't think is acceptable.\" In 2008 the prince's first tour was cut short after a news blackout about the deployment collapsed, raising fears he would be targeted by the Taliban. News teams were allowed to interview him during this tour, while agreeing to delay broadcast until he had left the country. 'Country comes first' The prince described himself as having three parts to his life: \"One in the army, one socially - my own private time - and one sort of with the family and stuff like that. So, you know, there is a switch and I flick it when necessary. \"And I like to think it's measured and balanced... Army comes first - it is my work at the end of the day. \"Whenever anybody sees me they presume that I'm off... gallivanting around. I don't want to sound as if I'm whingeing but there are times when doing all the army stuff and doing public engagements and stuff like that... is exhausting, and people criticise me.\" He said his brother, Prince William, an RAF pilot, shared his view that \"our service towards our country in the military - whichever shape or form it takes - will always come first\". Captain Wales, as the prince is known in the military, arrived for his second tour as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps in September. During his UK absence, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge announced they are expecting their first child - although Catherine's medical condition prompted them to do so very early in her pregnancy. Prince Harry said: \"Obviously I'm thrilled for both of them. It's about time. I can't wait to be an uncle. \"I think it's very unfair that they were forced to publicise it when they were, but that's just the media for you. \"And I literally am very, very happy for them, but I just only hope that she and him, but mainly Catherine... gets the necessary protection to allow her as a mother-to-be to enjoy the privacy that that comes with.\" The full interview will be broadcast on BBC News Channel at 22:30 GMT, 21 January 2013.",

    "text": "Mr Meng was first reported missing in late September after travelling from Interpol HQ in France to China. His wife has revealed that he sent her a text message with a knife emoji on the day he went missing. Mr Meng is the latest high-profile target to be ensnared in China's sweeping anti-corruption campaign. He is also a vice-minister for public security in the country. In its announcement of the investigation, China's Public Security Ministry said the probe was \"correct, wise and shows the determination of [President Xi]'s administration to continue its anti-corruption drive\". Interpol is the global policing agency that co-ordinates between police forces around the world, including searches for missing and wanted persons. Interpol's general secretariat oversees the day-to-day work of the 192-member organisation, with the role of the president largely ceremonial. After Mr Meng's disappearance was made public on Friday, speculation had mounted that he had been taken into custody. A number of top Chinese government officials, billionaires and even an A-list celebrity have vanished in recent months. Last week, actress Fan Bingbing, who disappeared in July, emerged with a public apology and a fine of 883 million yuan ($129m; £98.9m) for tax evasion and other offences. But correspondents say that Mr Meng's high-profile position at Interpol was once seen as a prize for Beijing, raising questions about whom he might have angered or what he might have done to be targeted as part of President Xi's anti-corruption blitz. What has Interpol said about the matter? In a statement on Twitter on Sunday, it said it had received Mr Meng's resignation with immediate effect. Under its terms it has appointed senior vice-president Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as acting president. A new president will be elected for the remaining two years of Mr Meng's mandate at the general assembly in Dubai next month. On Saturday, the international police agency urged China to clarify Mr Meng's status, saying it was concerned about the well-being of its president. There has been no word from him on the charges he faces. What did his wife say? French authorities have opened an investigation and have placed Mr Meng's wife under police protection after she received threats. Grace Meng, speaking shortly before China's confirmation of the detention, had told journalists she thought he was in danger. She issued an emotional plea for international help to find her husband. On the day he went missing, she said he had sent her a social media message telling her to \"wait for my call\", before sending a knife emoji, signifying danger. With her back to the cameras to avoid being identified out of fear for her safety, she held back sobs to read out a statement in Chinese and English. \"We are always connected by [our] hearts. He would support me in doing this. The matter belongs to fairness and justice. The matter belongs to the international community. The matter belongs to the people of my motherland.\" The reach of the Communist Party Analysis by Robin Brant, in Beijing When Meng Hongwei was appointed two years ago, one newspaper here wrote that it would \"promote understanding abroad of China's justice system\". This is probably not what was envisaged back then. His \"resignation\" and apparent detention makes it clear that it's the laws of China - and the rules of its governing Communist Party - that trump all else for any government official. Even if they're appointed to a job in France. China's new National Supervision Commission - an anti-corruption agency - said Mr Meng was being investigated for \"violation of laws\". Importantly it didn't mention - as is often the case with high-profile detentions like this - the charge of \"violating party rules\". The anti-corruption body has targeted thousands of people in a relentless drive led by President Xi Jinping. There are also rumours that Mr Meng may have been purged because of his links to another senior party figure out of favour with the leadership. Will this affect China's image? The investigation into Mr Meng has raised some concern that international institutions will be reluctant to appoint Chinese officials to high positions - something Beijing has pushed for in recent years. Chinese nationals hold top positions at several global institutions including the UN, IMF, World Bank and Unesco. But Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing said while he believes the current case is not likely to affect future appointments, it does have an impact on China's image on the international stage. \"There's obviously going to be some bad publicity around this and it's not like China doesn't care about this,\" he said. \"But whatever they want Mr Meng for has in this case trumped their concern for international public opinion.\" Who is Meng Hongwei? He was elected Interpol president in November 2016, the first Chinese person to take up the post, and was scheduled to serve until 2020. He headed the organisation's Executive Committee, which provides overall guidance and direction. Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control. After his election, human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country.",

    "text": "It said this would \"not significantly alter\" the spread of the virus, which is linked to serious birth defects. In an open letter to the WHO, more than 100 leading scientists had said new findings about Zika made it \"unethical\" for the Games to go ahead. They also said the global health body should revisit its Zika guidance. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it sees no reason to delay or move the Games because of the mosquito-borne disease. The outbreak began in Brazil a year ago, but now more than 60 countries and territories have continuing transmission. Between February and April 2016, Brazil's health ministry registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus. The number of babies born with Zika-linked defects stood at 4,908 in April. While Zika's symptoms are mild, in the letter the experts say it causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and may also cause a rare and sometimes fatal neurological syndrome in adults. The letter is signed by 150 international scientists, doctors and medical ethicists from such institutions as Oxford University and Harvard and Yale universities in the United States. They cite the failure of a mosquito-eradication programme in Brazil, and the country's \"weakened\" health system as reasons to postpone or move the Olympics in \"the name of public health\". More on the Zika crisis: Microcephaly: Why it is not the end of the world What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do The mosquito behind Zika What we know about the insect Abortion dilemma Laws and practices in Catholic Latin America \"An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,\" the letter says. The biggest risk, it adds, is if athletes contract the virus and returned home to poor countries that have not yet suffered a Zika outbreak. They also express concern the WHO has a conflict of interest because of its partnership with the IOC. The Rio Olympics are due to take place between 5 and 21 August. In a statement, the WHO, which has declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency, said: \"Brazil is one of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. \"People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice.\" Several public health experts had previously warned that hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Rio would speed up Zika's spread and lead to the births of brain-damaged babies. But on Thursday, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose advice is quoted approvingly in the letter, said the threat did not warrant halting the Games. \"There is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics,\" Dr Tom Frieden said. However, he urged the US to act more quickly to prevent pregnant women contracting Zika, amid congressional deadlock over the release of $1.9bn (£1.3bn) in funding. And virology researcher Oliver Brady, from Oxford University, said the risk was comparatively low because the Olympics would take place during Brazil's winter. \"We really think August is about 20 to 40 times lower risk than we see around now or in January where we see these large numbers of cases reported from Rio,\" he told the BBC. The Olympics have never been moved for public health reasons but Fifa relocated its 2003 Women's World Cup from China to the US because of the Sars epidemic.",

    "text": "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said its board \"voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority\" to expel him. Its members include Hollywood figures such as Tom Hanks and Whoopi Goldberg. Weinstein's films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and won 81. In a statement, the Academy said governors voted to expel Weinstein \"not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of wilful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over\". They added: \"What's at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society.\" The emergency board meeting followed an avalanche of accusations against the producer by more than two dozen women, including actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan, who alleges that he raped her in a hotel room. Police forces in the US and the UK are investigating the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has apologised for some aspects of his behaviour but insisted that any sexual contacts he had were consensual, and he denies accusations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault. The expulsion comes after Bob Weinstein told the Hollywood Reporter that his \"sick and depraved\" brother should be \"kicked out\" of the Academy. Filmmaker Woody Allen told the BBC the scandal was \"very sad for everybody involved\". \"Tragic for all women involved and sad for Harvey. The whole situation is very sad. There are no winners in that,\" he said in New York. Weinstein's expulsion means he will no longer be able to vote for nominees or winners in the Oscars. Hollywood figures were quick to praise the move but some have called for the Academy to take similar action against other members. Where does the Academy go from here? By the BBC's Laura Bicker in Los Angeles The Academy is trying to send a message that the casting couch culture that has been talked about in this industry for so long is over. This is a key moment for an industry which stands accused of developing a culture that makes women feel that exploitation is a price to pay to get a job. But in voting to expel Harvey Weinstein, the Academy has a problem. If Weinstein is indeed the tip of the iceberg, as many industry insiders have said, what do they do about other members who have been accused of sexual assault, such as Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski? As many people who have spoken to me here have said, the Academy condemnation cannot stop here. It is only the second time a member has been expelled. Actor Carmine Caridi had his membership revoked in 2004 after he allegedly sent confidential film preview videos to a friend which ended up online. As the co-founder of Miramax Pictures and the Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein produced some of cinema's most celebrated films, including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, and Shakespeare in Love. He has been thanked dozens of times in Oscar acceptance speeches, and in 2012 the actress Meryl Streep jokingly referred to him as \"God\" onstage. But as accusations against Weinstein began to mount in recent days, film industry heavyweights came out to publicly condemn him and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) suspended his membership. The French government is reportedly considering revoking his Legion of Honour, France's highest civilian distinction, and there have been calls from some British politicians for his honorary CBE title to be revoked. 'Sick and depraved' Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Bob Weinstein called his brother \"sick and depraved\" and said he had no idea of \"the type of predator that he was\". He refused to comment on reports that he and the board of Weinstein Company were aware of Weinstein's settlements with women during recent contract negotiations, saying only that the board \"did not know the extent of my brother's actions\". He went on to call his brother's apology statement \"utter insanity\" and a \"lame excuse\". \"I'll tell you what I did know,\" he said. \"Harvey was a bully, Harvey was arrogant...that I knew\". Earlier, Bob Weinstein denied media reports that the Weinstein Company - which has placed Harvey Weinstein on indefinite leave - could now be closed or sold. But several large film projects have been pulled from the company already, and reports in the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal said that financers had begun to pressure the board to sell. Weinstein has denied allegations of rape detailed in The New Yorker magazine, saying that there were no acts of non-consensual sex. His wife Georgina Chapman said on Tuesday that she was leaving him.

    "text": "He said he did not want his illness to get in the way of decision making, and apologised to the Japanese people for failing to complete his term in office. The 65-year-old has suffered for many years from ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, but he said his condition had worsened recently. Last year, he became Japan's longest serving prime minister. His current period in office began in 2012. He will remain in his post until a successor is chosen. In 2007 he resigned abruptly from an earlier term as prime minister because of his struggles with ulcerative colitis, a chronic condition that he has lived with since he was a teenager. Mr Abe has a reputation as a staunch conservative and nationalist, and for stimulating growth with his aggressive economic policy known as \"Abenomics\". He has strengthened Japan's defences and boosted military spending, but has been unable to revise the constitution's pacifist Article 9, which bans a standing army for anything other than self-defence. What did Mr Abe say? The prime minister said his health started to decline as his ulcerative colitis made a resurgence around the middle of July. He was now receiving a new treatment for the condition which had to be administered on a regular basis and would not give him enough time to carry out his prime ministerial functions, he added. He said he could not make any mistakes in terms of important decision making, and therefore had decided to step down. \"I made a judgement I should not continue my job as a prime minister,\" he said. \"I would like to sincerely apologise to the people of Japan for leaving my post with one year left in my term of office, and amid the coronavirus woes, while various policies are still in the process of being implemented,\" he added, making a bow. He also expressed regret at not fulfilling his core pledges - forcing North Korea to return Japanese citizens abducted decades ago; sorting out a territorial dispute with Russia; and overhauling the constitution to give more power to the military. Abe's emotional farewell By Mariko Oi, BBC News, Tokyo Announcing his resignation at a news conference, Mr Abe spoke without the use of a teleprompter, which is unusual for him. Rather than addressing prepared questions, the prime minister mostly took questions. He seemed drained and was at times emotional as he faced the reporters. Asked about his attempts to control his public image - for instance by pre-selecting questions for news briefings - he avoided answering by saying that his administration wasn't the first to do so. He was also repeatedly asked who he thought should replace him, or when, to which he said it wasn't his place to weigh in. But the Liberal Democratic Party which has almost continuously been in power since 1955 has many different factions so the race is on between them to get the top job. Those close to Mr Abe, like Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga or Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso, are not necessarily the most popular among voters as his administration has faced criticism for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. What happens now? Mr Abe said he would \"firmly execute my duty to the end\" until a replacement was chosen. His announcement will have automatically triggered a vote within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as leader. The party will decide next Tuesday how to hold an election, Kyodo news agency reports. This election will be followed by a parliamentary vote to elect a new prime minister. Potential successors have already emerged, including Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and LDP policy chief Fumio Kishida, who is rumoured to be Mr Abe's choice. None are expected to deviate significantly from the government's current policies. The winner would hold the post until the end of Mr Abe's term in September 2021.",

    "text": "South Korea confirmed it had received a call from the North at 15:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Wednesday. The North Korean leader had earlier said he was open to dialogue with Seoul and to sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South next month. The two nations have not held high-level talks since December 2015. North Korea cut off the communications channel shortly afterwards, refusing to answer calls, according to officials in the South. A North Korean official announced the hotline's reopening in a televised statement. Instead of a senior newscaster, the chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Son-gwon, made the statement, saying he was speaking \"upon authorisation of Kim Jong-un\". The initial call was brief as checks are still being carried out on the line, according to South Korean officials. North Korea said the aim would be for the two nations to discuss the practical issues around sending a North Korean delegation to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. How has the South responded? The press secretary for South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the restoration of this communications channel was \"very significant\". \"It creates an environment where communication will be possible at all times,\" he said. In the press, there was scepticism. \"Kim's New Year's address is a highly calculated move to fuel internal division in South Korea,\" said daily newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. \"Pyongyang may have decided on its peace offensive to buy time until the completion of its nuclear weapons programme.\" Hankyoreh newspaper also voiced caution: \"Kim has not budged an inch from his previous reckless and hard-line stance on the development of nuclear weapons and missiles.\" But the \"surprising New Year's address could open the door to peace\", it added. Where is the physical line? According to the South Korean Unification Ministry, there are a total of 33 direct lines that North and South Korea once used to communicate with each other. This particular phone line, established in 1971, is based in Panmunjom. The border village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the Koreas have historically held talks. Why have the Olympics become so important? In a New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim spoke of lowering tensions and of melting \"frozen North-South relations\". He said attending the Games would be \"a good opportunity to show unity of the people\" in North Korea. South Korea had already indicated that the North's participation in the Games would be welcomed. Seoul offered high-level talks in response, with President Moon Jae-in calling it a \"groundbreaking chance\" to improve relations. It is not yet clear whether North Korea will accept that offer, but the opening of the hotline will allow for preliminary discussions to be held. When did the line stop being used? North Korea cut off communications on the hotline in 2016, following a row over the Kaesong industrial complex. The complex was a joint economic venture between the two Koreas, but the South suspended the project in response to a nuclear weapons test by the North. Have the two already held secret meetings? In China in late December, according to North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden. A North Korean vice-minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions, he says, adding that this might ease the higher-level talks. Will nuclear testing be discussed? North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme. President Moon said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. What role might the US play? At the same time as offering an apparent olive branch to the South, Mr Kim used his speech to repeat threats against the US, saying a nuclear launch button was always on his table. US state department spokesman Heather Nauert said that Mr Kim's latest move \"may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations - between our nation and the Republic of Korea [South Korea]\". Washington has encouraged all countries to isolate North Korea. The South says it has discussed its latest steps with the US. Meanwhile, Mr Trump remains outspoken in his tweets. On Tuesday night, the US president boasted that his nuclear button was \"much bigger\" and \"more powerful\" than the North Korean leader's. What does China say? Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the North and South should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to ease their relationship. \"All relevant sides should grab hold of this positive trend in the Korean peninsula and move in the same direction,\" Mr Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing, according to Reuters news agency.",

    "text": "By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter However, he expressed sadness at what he described as the \"extraordinary and untenable circumstances\" surrounding Mr Trump's permanent suspension. He also said the ban was in part a failure of Twitter's, which hadn't done enough to foster \"healthy conversation\" across its platforms. Twitter has been praised and criticised for freezing Mr Trump's account. German leader Angela Merkel and Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador - neither an ally of the outgoing US president - spoke out against the tech titan's move. In a long Twitter thread, Twitter's chief said he did not celebrate or feel pride in the ban - which came after the Capitol riot last week. He reiterated that removing the president from Twitter was made after \"a clear warning\" to Mr Trump. \"We made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter,\" Mr Dorsey said. He also accepted that the move would have consequences for an open and free internet. \"Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us….And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous.\" He also addressed criticism that just a handful of tech bosses can make decisions on who does and doesn't have a voice on the internet - and on accusations of censorship. \"A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same,\" said Mr Dorsey. The decision to remove users, posts and tweets has been criticised by some for violating First Amendment - free speech - rights. However, big tech firms generally argue that as they are private companies, and not state actors, this law does not apply when they moderate their platforms. Facebook and YouTube have taken steps to silence the president, while Amazon shut down Parler, an app widely used by his supporters. Now Snapchat has also announced that Mr Trump will be permanently banned from its platform too. It had already announced an indefinite suspension, but has now decided that \"in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence\" to permanently terminate his account. On Monday, the German chancellor's spokesperson said she found the social media ban \"problematic\". And the Mexican president said: \"I don't like anybody being censored.\" Incoming US President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants companies like Facebook and Twitter to do more to take down hate speech and fake news. He has previously said he wants to repeal Section 230, a law protecting social media companies from being sued for the things people post. It's not clear how Mr Biden intends to regulate Big Tech, though it's likely to be a legislative focus of his.",

Russia has declared him \"persona non grata\" and ordered his expulsion, the foreign ministry said on its website. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, had been summoned, it added. Mr Fogle is said to have worked as third political secretary at the US embassy in Moscow, which has issued no comment on the matter so far. Photos have emerged of his alleged detention. The agent was reportedly arrested with a large sum of money, technical devices and written instructions for the agent he had tried to recruit. While it is a sensitive time for US-Russian relations because of the crisis in Syria, the FSB's claims to have unearthed a CIA agent are unlikely to have any long-term political consequences, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow. Both countries recently said they wished to step up security co-operation after the Boston Marathon bombing. 'Dear friend' FSB photos purporting to show Mr Fogle during and after his detention appeared on Russian online media, such as these published by broadcaster RT. Wearing a blue checked shirt and a plain baseball cap, he is shown being held on the ground with his hands bound, then being escorted away. Another photo shows him sitting at desk, his hat removed. Possessions said to be Mr Fogle's are laid out on a table. They include a sum of money in 500-euro banknotes and two wigs, one of which he was apparently wearing at the time of his detention. Also on the table are a compass, map, knife, dark glasses and small mobile phone. \"FSB counter-intelligence agents detained a CIA staff member who had been working under the cover of third political secretary of the US embassy in Moscow,\" the FSB said. \"At the moment of detention, special technical equipment was discovered, written instructions for the Russian citizen being recruited, as well as a large sum of money and means for altering appearance.\" Russian state TV has displayed a piece of paper, which it said was Mr Fogle's letter to the Russian officer. Addressing the recipient as \"Dear friend\", the letter offers $100,000 (£65,400) \"to discuss your experience, expertise and co-operation\". It goes on to say: \"We can offer up to $1m a year for long-term co-operation, with extra bonuses if we receive some helpful information. \"This is a down-payment from someone who is very impressed with your professionalism and who would greatly appreciate your co-operation in the future.\" The letter is simply signed \"Your friends\".",

    "text": "By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing The government denies that it is attempting to alter the demographics of its far-western region and says the job transfers are designed to raise incomes and alleviate chronic rural unemployment and poverty. But our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking. The study, which was meant for the eyes of senior officials but accidentally placed online, forms part of a BBC investigation based on propaganda reports, interviews, and visits to factories across China. And we ask questions about the possible connections between transferred Uighur labour and two major western brands, as international concern mounts over the extent to which it is already ingrained in global supply chains. In a village in southern Xinjiang, hay is being gathered in the fields and families are placing fruit and flatbreads on their supas, the low platforms around which Uighur family life has traditionally revolved. But the warm wind blowing across the Taklamakan desert is bringing with it worry and change. The video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away. After two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house. What follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes. Although it was broadcast in 2017, around the time the policy began to be intensified, the video has not featured in international news reporting until now. The officials speak to one father who is clearly reluctant to send his daughter, Buzaynap, so far away. \"There must be someone else who'd like to go,\" he tries to plead. \"We can make our living here, let us live a life like this.\" They speak directly to 19-year old Buzaynap, telling her that, if she stays she will be married soon and never able to leave. \"Have a think, will you go?\" they ask. Under the intense scrutiny of the government officials and state-TV journalists she shakes her head and replies, \"I won't go.\" Still, the pressure continues until eventually, weeping, she concedes. \"I'll go if others go,\" she says. The film ends with tearful goodbyes between mothers and daughters as Buzaynap and other similarly \"mobilised\" recruits leave their family and culture behind. Professor Laura Murphy is an expert in human rights and contemporary slavery at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University who lived in Xinjiang between 2004 and 2005 and has visited since. \"This video is remarkable,\" she told the BBC. \"The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist.\" \"The other thing it shows is this ulterior motive,\" she said, \"that although the narrative is one of lifting people out of poverty, there's a drive to entirely change people's lives, to separate families, disperse the population, change their language, their culture, their family structures, which is more likely to increase poverty than to decrease it.\" A marked shift in China's approach to its governance of Xinjiang can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters - in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - which it blamed on Uighur Islamists and separatists. At the heart of its response - in both the camps and the work transfer schemes - has been a drive to replace \"old\" Uighur loyalties to culture and the Islamic faith with a \"modern\" materialist identity and an enforced allegiance to the Communist Party. This overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC. Based on field work conducted in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture in May 2018, the report was inadvertently made publicly available online in December 2019 and then subsequently taken down a few months later. Written by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are \"an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities\" and bring about a \"transformation of their thinking.\" Uprooting them and relocating them elsewhere in the region or in other Chinese provinces, it says, \"reduces Uighur population density.\" The report was discovered online by an overseas-based Uighur who passed it to Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington. Before the university realized its error, Dr Zenz saved the report (in Chinese) on a web-archive site and has now written his own analysis of it, which includes an English translation of the full document. \"This is an unprecedented, authoritative source written by leading academics and former government officials with high-level access to Xinjiang itself,\" Dr Zenz told the BBC. \"The excess surplus population that somehow has to be dealt with, and labour transfers as a means to reduce the concentration of those workers in their own heartlands is, in my opinion, the most stunning admission of this report.\" His analysis includes a legal opinion from Erin Farrell Rosenberg, a former senior advisor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, that the Nankai Report provides \"credible grounds\" for the crimes against humanity of forcible transfer and persecution. In a written statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said, \"The report reflects only the author's personal view and much of its contents are not in line with the facts.\" \"We hope that journalists will use the authoritative information released by the Chinese government as the basis for reporting on Xinjiang.\" The Nankai report authors write glowingly of an effort to combat poverty underwritten by a \"guarantee of voluntariness\" in the work placements, and with the factories allowing the workers to \"leave and return freely.\" But those claims are somewhat at odds with the level of detail they provide about the way the policy works in practice. There are \"targets\" to be reached, with Hotan Prefecture alone - at the time the study was undertaken - having already exported 250,000 workers, one fifth of its total working age population. There is pressure to meet the targets, with recruiting stations set up \"in every village\" and officials tasked to \"mobilize collectively\" and \"visit households,\" just as in 19-year-old Buzaynap's case. And there are signs of control at every stage, with all recruits put through \"political thought education,\" then transported to the factories in groups - sometimes as many as hundreds at a time - and \"led and accompanied by political cadres in order to implement security and management.\" Farmers unwilling to leave their lands or herds behind are encouraged to transfer them to a centralized government scheme that manages them in their absence. And once they arrive in their new factory jobs, workers themselves are put under the \"centralized management\" of officials who \"eat and live\" with them. But the report also notes that the profound discrimination at the heart of the system is getting in the way of its effective functioning, with local police forces in eastern China so alarmed by the arrival of trainloads of Uighurs, that they are sometimes turned back. In places, it even warns that China's policies in Xinjiang may have been too extreme, for example, stating that the number of people placed in the re-education camps \"far exceeds\" those with suspected connections to extremism. \"The entire Uighur population should not be assumed to be rioters,\" it says. The Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui. It was to this factory that Buzaynap, featured in the state-TV report, was sent. When the BBC visited, the separate, five-story Uighur dormitory showed few signs of habitation apart from a pair of shoes placed by an open window. At the gate, the security guard said that the Uighur workers \"have gone back home,\" adding that it was because of the country's Covid controls, and in a statement Huafu told us that, \"the company does not currently employ Xinjiang workers.\" The BBC was able to find pillowcases made with Huafu yarn on sale on Amazon's UK website, although it is not possible to confirm if the product is linked to the particular factory we visited, or one of the company's other facilities. Amazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale. The BBC worked with a group of international journalists based in China, visiting a total of six factories between us. At the Dongguan Luzhou Shoes factory in Guangdong Province, one worker said the Uighur employees used separate dormitories and their own canteen, and another local told reporters that the company makes shoes for Skechers. The factory has previously been linked to the US company, with unverified social media videos purportedly showing Uighur workers making Skechers product lines, and references to a relationship in online Chinese business directories. In a statement, Skechers said it had \"zero tolerance for forced labour,\" but did not answer questions about whether it used Dongguan Luzhou as a supplier. Dongguan Luzhou did not respond to a request for comment. Interviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed. In at least two cases, reporters were told of some restrictions, and at one facility in the city of Wuhan a Han Chinese employee told the BBC that his 200 or so Uighur colleagues were not allowed out at all. Three months after Buzaynap was shown leaving her village to begin her political education training, the Chinese state-TV crew meet her again, this time in the Huafu Textile Company in Anhui. The theme of assimilation is, once again, central to the news report. In one scene, Buzaynap is close to tears as she is scolded for her mistakes, but eventually, a transformation is said to be taking place. \"The timid girl who didn't speak and kept her head down,\" we are told, \"is gaining authority at work.\" \"Lifestyles are changing and thoughts are changing.\" Producer: Kathy Long",

    "text": "By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News What is the scale of the attack? Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is \"unprecedented\", according to EU police body Europol. It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend. There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life. In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took. The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments - $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up. Is my computer at risk? WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk. However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain. You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages. Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre website contains advice on how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't. How did the attack spread so fast? The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised. It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus. Why weren't people protected? In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency. When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction. It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small. Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly. Who was behind the attack? It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The \"kill switch\" that stopped it spreading - accidentally discovered by a security researcher - may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly. Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace. However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace.",

    "text": "The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades - also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal \"chronic losses and years of tax avoidance\", it says. Mr Trump called the report \"fake news\". \"Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,\" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. \"The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me well… they treat me very badly,\" he said. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was \"provided by sources with legal access to it\". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. What are the key claims? The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, \"largely because he reported losing much more money than he made\". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS \"portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes\". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics, the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\". \"Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,\" he said. By using the term \"personal taxes\", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. What else does the report say? The newspaper also claims that \"most\" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - \"report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year\". \"That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,\" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from \"lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour\" from the president. The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money \"from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics\". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to \"carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years\". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story \"goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman\". \"You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,\" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: \"That makes me smart.\" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. What has the reaction been? Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken \"extraordinary measures\" to \"game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes\". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. Unwanted distraction for Trump or more? So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The 25-year-old needed hospital treatment after his lungs could not get enough oxygen into his body. Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. \"Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection,\" said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. \"The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity.\" He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was \"very concerning\" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. \"Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. \"It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection.\" Follow James on Twitter",

    "text": "In his first public address, Mahn Win Khaing Than said \"this is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close\". From hiding, he leads a group of legislators who have refused to accept last month's coup. Protests continued on Sunday with at least five people killed. Local media and a doctor quoted by AFP news agency reported a young man shot dead by security forces in the northern jade-producing city of Hpakant. Another young man was killed in Bago, near the main city of Yangon, according to local reporters and witnesses. Local media also reported three protesters killed in clashes in Yangon itself. The latest casualties follow the deaths of 12 protesters on Saturday, according to BBC Burmese and eyewitnesses. Myanmar (also known as Burma) has been gripped by street protests since the military seized control on 1 February and detained Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party. The NLD won a landslide victory in last year's election, but the military said the poll was fraudulent. NLD MPs who managed to escape arrest formed a new group, the CRPH, or Committee for Representing the Union Parliament. Mahn Win Khaing Than was appointed acting head. The CRPH is seeking international recognition as Myanmar's rightful government. What did Mahn Win Khaing Than say? In a speech on Facebook, Mahn Win Khaing Than said: \"This is the time for our citizens to test their resistance against the dark moments. \"In order to form a federal democracy, which all ethnic brothers, who have been suffering various kinds of oppressions from the dictatorship for decades, really desired, this revolution is the chance for us to put our efforts together. \"Despite our differences in the past, this is the time we must grip our hands together to end the dictatorship for good. \" The military considers the CRPH to be an illegal group, warning that anyone co-operating with them will face treason charges. What's the background? Independent international observers have disputed the military's claim of the fraudulent election held in November 2020, saying no irregularities were observed. Last week, the military accused Ms Suu Kyi of illegally accepting $600,000 (£430,000) and 11kg of gold. No evidence was provided and an NLD lawmaker denied the allegation. Ms Suu Kyi has been held for the past five weeks at an undisclosed location and faces several other charges including causing \"fear and alarm\", illegally possessing radio equipment, and breaking Covid-19 restrictions. Since the coup the military has used violent force to try to quell protests, leaving dozens dead and prompting widespread international condemnation. The US has announced sanctions on coup leaders, while steps are also being taken to block access by the military to $1bn of government funds held in the US. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions, instead blaming Ms Suu Kyi for the violence. Myanmar profile",

    "text": "IS said the men were soldiers captured in the city of Homs. They were shot dead inside Palmyra's amphitheatre. Stills from the video showed the killers to be young males, possibly even as young as 13 or 14. IS captured Palmyra and the neighbouring modern city, locally known as Tadmur, in late May. The video was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. It is not clear when it was filmed. The killings took place on a stage in the amphitheatre in front of a large black IS flag. Several hundred men in civilian clothes are filmed sitting on steps watching the shootings. Among them was a young boy. In close-up shots of the men waiting to be killed, they appear to have been beaten on the face. Days after IS claimed Palmyra, it executed 20 men in the same amphitheatre. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says shootings took place in the amphitheatre on 27 May, but it is not clear if those killings are the ones in the video. The video goes on to show the destruction of Tadmur prison, which occurred in late May. In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria's head of antiquities, said: \"Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.\" Mr Abdulkarim said most of the museum's antiquities had been transferred to Damascus before IS approached the city. Since then, there have been reports that mines have been planted among some of Palmyra's ruins, and there were claims this week that militants destroyed an ancient sculpture outside Palmyra's museum. Since capturing the city, IS has also taken control of a military airbase and a notorious prison nearby. The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. Fighters with IS started claiming vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, aided in part by the insecurity generated by Syria's civil war. More than 230,000 Syrians have died in the war, which began after President Bashar al-Assad's forces tried to put down anti-government protests in March 2011.",

    "text": "He is currently facing criminal charges on five counts of sexual abuse, including rape, relating to two accusers - charges he denies. He also faces a number of civil cases, including one brought by the actress Ashley Judd, one of his earliest accusers. Mr Weinstein has admitted in the past that his behaviour has \"caused a lot of pain\", but denies any non-consensual sex and has described many allegations against him as \"patently false\". So what's going on with his legal cases? What about the criminal charges? Mr Weinstein is due to go on trial in New York later this year on five charges of sexually assaulting two women. He is accused of forcibly performing oral sex on one of the women in July 2006, and of raping the other woman in March 2013. If found guilty, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. The 66-year-old was arrested and charged in May 2018 in what New York City Police Department said had been a \"joint investigation between the NYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney\". He formally pleaded not guilty to the charges in June 2018 in New York's Supreme Court. He has been released on $1m (£751,000) bail, and has agreed to surrender his passport and wear a GPS tracker. Over the last few months, at the various pre-trial hearings, Mr Weinstein's lawyers have raised doubts about the police investigation, portraying it as chaotic and poorly managed. In August, they released dozens of \"warm\" emails they say Mr Weinstein received from one of his accusers after an alleged rape. One sex assault charge, brought by actress Lucia Evans, was thrown out in October after a police officer allegedly interfered with a witness. But an attempt by the defence team to have all the charges thrown out was rejected by a judge in December. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, is no stranger to high-profile cases involving sexual allegations against powerful men. He successfully defended the former head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, by attacking the credibility of the accuser - a not uncommon strategy in so-called \"he said-she said\" cases, where it boils down to one person's word against another's. What about Ashley Judd's legal action? Ashley Judd was one of the first women in Hollywood to accuse Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct in a series of articles which appeared in the New York Times and The New Yorker magazine in October 2017. She launched a civil lawsuit in April 2018 after Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said he had been considering Ms Judd for a part in the hit 2002 film when he was warned by Mr Weinstein that she was a \"nightmare\" to work with. Mr Weinstein has insisted he played no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. But she alleges in her lawsuit that he \"cornered her in a hotel room in 1997 under the guise of discussing business\", and when she rejected his advances he retaliated by making \"baseless smears\" to Mr Jackson that meant she lost the part. A Los Angeles judge in January 2019 dismissed her claim for sexual harassment, saying it fell outside the scope of the law under which she brought it, but that she could continue with her claim of defamation. Could Weinstein face further charges? It is possible he could face further criminal charges. At the time of his arrest, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said its inquiry was ongoing. Police in California and the UK are investigating allegations of sexual misconduct, which could produce fresh charges. London's Metropolitan Police said Mr Weinstein had been accused of assaulting three women in separate incidents in the late 1980s, 1992, 2010, 2011 and 2015. But many of the allegations made against him are too old under the law to be the basis for a criminal charge. However, as in the case of Ashley Judd, he is facing a number of civil complaints. In November, legal documents produced as part of a class-action lawsuit brought by nine women included an allegation that he sexually assaulted a 16-year-old Polish model in 2002. Mr Brafman called the allegations in the lawsuit \"preposterous\".",

    "text": "Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, travelled to Turkey on Tuesday. It is feared they may be planning to join Islamic State extremists in Syria. Shamima's family said they understood she wanted to help those suffering but said Syria was \"a dangerous place\". Kadiza's family said they were \"feeling completely distressed\". Meanwhile the family of a Glasgow woman who travelled to Syria in 2013, who reportedly contacted at least one of the girls on social media, said they were \"full of horror and anger\" that their daughter may have helped recruit the girls. In a statement released through their lawyer, the family of Aqsa Mahmood told her: \"You are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam.\" 'Complete nightmare' The three London girls, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets, flew from Gatwick to Turkey on Tuesday after telling their parents they were going out for the day. Police said the girls had been interviewed by officers after another girl from their school went to Syria in December, but nothing had indicated they were at risk and their disappearance had come as a great surprise. In a statement, Shamima's family said: \"We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you. \"Syria is a dangerous place and we don't want you to go there. Get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home. Police have issued a description of the three girls: \"We understand that you have strong feelings and want to help those you believe are suffering in Syria. \"You can help from home, you don't have to put yourself in danger. Please don't cross the border.\" Kadiza's family said: \"In your absence, we, as a family, are feeling completely distressed and cannot make sense of why you left home. \"Due to the speculation that you may be travelling towards Syria, we are extremely worried about your safety.\" The family said they were praying the girls would make contact. \"We all love you dearly and the last four days have been a complete nightmare not knowing where you are and how you are keeping,\" they added. \"We would like to emphasise that we are not angry with you and you have not done anything wrong. We just want you all to return home, safe and sound.\" Amira's family issued a statement pleading with her to come home \"as soon as possible\". \"You are strong, smart, beautiful and we are hoping you will make the right decision,\" they said. \"We miss you more that you can imagine. We are worried and we want you to think about what you have left behind. \"You had a bright future, so please return home.\" 'More robust' A friend who went to the same school as the girls, Atlanta Broadbent, told ITV News the girls had been \"determined in what they want to do\". The 16-year-old said: \"You couldn't argue with what they were saying. \"They were that smart they could just make something up on the spot. They were just really hard working, I wouldn't think something like this would happen.\" Earlier, David Cameron said the fight against Islamist extremist terror was \"not just one that we can wage by the police and border control\". \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognise they have a role to play. \"We all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult.\" Commons Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said exit checks must be \"more robust in the future\" and there needed to be \"much closer co-operation\" with Turkey in tackling the problem of people travelling through the country to Syria and Iraq. Aqsa Mahmood travelled from her home in Glasgow to Syria in November 2013 to marry an IS fighter. In a statement her family also said the UK's security services had \"serious questions to answer\". It said: \"Aqsa's social media has been monitored since she disappeared over a year ago, yet despite alleged contact between the girls and Aqsa, they failed to stop them from leaving the UK to Turkey, a staging post for Syria. \"Sadly, despite all the government's rhetoric on Isis, if they can't even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join Isis, what is the point of any new laws?\" The family also sent a message directly to Aqsa in which they said: \"You are killing your family every day with your actions, they are begging you stop if you ever loved them.\"",

    "text": "By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing At night, while travelling for hours along Xinjiang's desert highways, the unmarked cars that had been following us from the moment we arrived would tailgate us at speed, driving dangerously close with their headlights on full beam. Their occupants - who never identified themselves - forced us to leave one city by chasing us out of restaurants and shops, ordering the owners not to serve us. The report we produced, despite these difficulties, contained new evidence - much of it based on China's own policy documents - that thousands of Uighurs and other minorities are being forced to pick cotton in a region responsible for a fifth of the world's crop. But now China's Communist Party-run media have produced their own report about our reporting, accusing the BBC of exaggerating these efforts by the authorities to obstruct our team and calling it \"fake news\". The video, made by the China Daily - an English-language newspaper - has been posted on both Chinese social media sites, as well as international platforms banned in China. Hannah Bailey, who specialises in China's use of state-sponsored digital disinformation at the Oxford Internet Institute, suggests that such a fiercely critical attack in English, but with Chinese subtitles, makes it unusual. \"It has clearly been produced with both international and domestic users in mind,\" she told me, \"which is somewhat of a departure from previous strategies. \"Previous content produced for mainland audiences has been more critical of Western countries, and more vocally nationalistic, whereas content produced for international audiences has struck a more conciliatory tone.\" The China Daily report focuses on an altercation outside the front gate of a textile factory in the city of Kuqa, where the BBC team was surrounded by a group of managers and local officials. The allegations it contains, based on body camera recordings provided by the police who arrived at the scene, are easily dismissed. A polite exchange between our team and a police officer is used to suggest that the BBC exaggerated the role of the authorities in preventing us from reporting. But the China Daily chooses not to mention that some of our footage was forcibly deleted and we were made to accompany the same police officer to another location so she could review the remaining pictures. And it provides no explanation of the wider context, nor gives the BBC any right of reply. Over a period of less than 72 hours in Xinjiang we were followed constantly and, on five separate occasions, approached by people who attempted to stop us from filming in public, sometimes violently. In at least two instances, we were accused of breaching the privacy of these individuals on the basis that their attempts to stop us had led them to walk in front of our camera. The uniformed police officers attending these \"incidents\" twice deleted our footage and, on another occasion, we were briefly held by local officials who claimed we'd infringed a farmer's rights by filming a field. China's propaganda efforts may be a sign of just how damaging it believes the coverage of Xinjiang has been to its international reputation. But attempting to attack the - usually censored - Western media at home carries some risk, in that it can reveal glimpses of stories that would otherwise remain out of the public domain. A satellite photo, dated May 2019, shows a large group of people being moved between the Kuqa textile factory and a re-education camp located next door, complete with a watchtower and internal security walls. The China Daily, which refers to the camp by the official terminology as a \"Vocational Training Centre\" suggests our attempt to film was pointless because, they say, it closed in October 2019. If true, this simply proves that the camp was operational when the image was taken - and confirms it to be compelling grounds for further investigation. Now Chinese and Western audiences alike can ponder who the people in the photograph were, why they were being moved between the camp and the factory and whether any work they did there was likely to be fully voluntary. More coverage of China's hidden camps In an interview with one of the uniformed police officers who provided the body camera recordings, the China Daily video inadvertently provides corroboration of just how well-planned and multi-layered the control of journalists in Xinjiang really is. The officer confirms that, shortly after our arrival in Kuqa, she summoned us to a meeting in our hotel lobby to issue a warning about \"our rights and restrictions\". In fact, hotel staff told us we were forbidden to leave the hotel until after this meeting had taken place. It was also attended by two propaganda officials who were assigned to accompany us for the rest of our time in Kuqa - adding one more car to the long line that followed us wherever we went. Far from being fake news, our evidence, along with the post-publication propaganda designed to undermine it, is proof of a co-ordinated effort to control the narrative, extending from the shadowy minders in unmarked cars, all the way up to the national government. Upon our return to Beijing we were summoned to a meeting with officials who insisted that we should have sought permission from the owners of the factory before filming it. We pointed out that China's own media regulations do not prohibit the filming of a building from a public road. China is increasingly using the accreditation process for foreign journalists as a tool of control, issuing shortened visas and threats of non-renewal for those whose coverage it disapproves of. Following publication, I was given another shortened visa with the authorities making clear that it was as a result of my reporting on Xinjiang. The China Daily also accuses the BBC of using a hidden camera - we didn't. And it misrepresents the recording from the police body cameras by suggesting a comment made by BBC producer Kathy Long outside the factory, that we wouldn't use images of one man, were instead made in regard to someone else. Presuming they're in possession of the full recording it is hard to understand how this mistake could be made. Hannah Bailey from the Oxford Internet Institute says, like China's domestic propaganda, its international push-back may be becoming \"increasingly critical and defensive\". \"China has previously demonstrated its use of a variety of tools to manipulate international and domestic discourse, from Twitter bots to state-controlled international media outlets to the vocal so-called \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomats,\" she told me. \"Attempts to discredit foreign media are also a part of this toolkit.\" We offered the China Daily the opportunity to comment on the errors in its reporting. In a reply, which failed to address our specific questions, it said that having visited Xinjiang and conducted interviews it has concluded that \"there is no forced labour in Xinjiang\". Its propaganda video ends with a worker in the Kuqa textile factory being asked why she's there - a question that comes, she will know full well, from reporters under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party. \"I chose to work here,\" she tells them.

    "text": "Motiur Rahman Nizami, 71, faced 16 charges including genocide, murder, torture and rape. A state prosecutor said the sentence reflected the \"gravity of the crimes\". The defence said that the charges were not proven beyond reasonable doubt and that it would appeal. There are different estimates for the number of people killed in the nine-month Bangladeshi war of secession. Government figures suggest as many as three million people died, while some say that figure is too high and unverifiable. A war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh with a three-judge panel announced the verdict to a packed courtroom in Dhaka. Nizami, who was head of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was accused of acting as supreme commander of a militia, al-Badr, an auxiliary force which helped the Pakistani army identify and kill pro-independence activists in Bangladesh. The prosecution said the group carried out systematic torture and executions during the war, including of teachers, engineers and journalists. Nizami served as a minister in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government from 2001-2006. He was also given a death sentence in January after being convicted in an arms smuggling case. Nationwide strike \"Considering the gravity of the crimes, the tribunal punished him with the death sentence,\" state prosecutor Mohammad Ali told Reuters news agency. Prosecutor Tureen Afroz told the BBC: \"The prosecution team is very happy with the verdict that we could prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\" However, defence lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict. \"The tribunal went beyond its jurisdiction,\" defence counsel Tajul Islam told the BBC. \"The other charges just were not proven at all beyond any reasonable doubt and that is why we're very unhappy and we'll file an appeal.\" The Jamaat-e-Islami party called for a three-day nationwide strike to protest the decision. Analysis: Sabir Mustafa, BBC Bengali Service editor The trial of Motiur Rahman Nizami was one of the most eagerly awaited events in Bangladesh's recent history. Among several other crimes, Nizami was found guilty of responsibility in the targeted killing of dozens of Bengali intellectuals in the last days of the war. The killing of the intellectuals has been one of the most emotive issues in Bangladesh for the past 43 years, and Nizami's conviction is likely to go a long way to bring a sense of justice and closure to families of the victims. His conviction deals a severe blow to Jamaat-e-Islami's standing in the country. Jamaat has long refused to apologise for its role during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971, when the party collaborated closely with the Pakistan army fighting Bengali nationalists. With the party leader found guilty of genocide and murder, it increases pressure on Jamaat to come to terms with this especially dark chapter in its history. But Jamaat's decision to call three days of general strikes shows the party is still reluctant to acknowledge its alleged role in carrying out atrocities. Without making a break from its 1971 legacy, Jamaat is likely to remain the most controversial political party in Bangladesh. Controversial tribunal Higher security measures were in place across Dhaka ahead of the sentencing. After the sentence was announced, street protests erupted in several towns, and Jamaat supporters clashed with police. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesters. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set up the war crimes tribunal in 2010 to look into abuses during the independence war. Correspondents say Nizami is one of the most important figures to be found guilty by this controversial court. Critics have said the government is using the tribunal to target political opponents. Human Rights Watch has previously said the court's procedures are not up to international standards. The Awami League, which leads the current government, says it's necessary to help the country come to terms with its past. Bangladesh independence war, 1971",

Mr Gevers shared what he said were screenshots of the inside of Mr Trump's account on 22 October, during the final stages of the US presidential election. But at the time, the White House denied it had been hacked and Twitter said it had no evidence of it. In reference to the latest development, Twitter said: \"We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim, including from the article published in the Netherlands today. We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government.\" The White House has not responded to a request for further comment. Mr Gevers said he was very happy with the outcome. \"This is not just about my work but all volunteers who look for vulnerabilities in the internet,\" he said. The well respected cyber-security researcher said he had been conducting a semi-regular sweep of the Twitter accounts of high-profile US election candidates, on 16 October, when he had guessed President Trump's password.

Mr Gevers had told officers he had substantially more evidence of the \"hack\". In theory, he would have been able to see all the president's data, including: The president's account, which has 89 million followers, is now secure. But Twitter has refused to answer direct questions from BBC News, including whether the account had extra security or logs that would have shown an unknown login.

It has inspired hundreds of parody clips, from members of the British army, Thai navy and Minecraft gamers, among others. YouTube's owner, Google, said the video had been watched seven million to 10 million times a day on average. It overtook the previous record holder - Justin Bieber's music video Baby - on 24 November. \"Psy's success is a great testament to the universal appeal of catchy music - and er, great equine dance moves,\" wrote Kevin Allocca, YouTube trends manager, on the service's blog. Globalised Gangnam One industry watcher said the fact so many people continued to post their own versions of Gangnam Style had played a huge part in the clip's success. \"I've seen a statistic which reckons the one song will have generated something like $8m [£5m] by the end of the year from money that comes directly from YouTube through advertising plus download sales, its uses in adverts and TV programmes,\" Chris Cooke, business editor of the CMU music news site, told the BBC. \"It shows that YouTube - which is a free-to-use as a promotional platform for the music labels - can lead to substantial income. \"Should every artist be trying to think of a funny video that will go viral and be mimicked? I don't know whether it's a template that can be copied, but it certainly shows how quickly an eye-catching clip can spread thanks to social networks and YouTube.\" Sir Martin Sorrell - chief executive of advertising giant WPP - paid tribute to the achievement by making a link between Psy and one of the west's most influential economists. \"Another great example of Theodore Levitt's 'globalisation' and the power of K-pop,\" he told the BBC. Scott Mills, the BBC Radio 1 DJ who championed the song on his show, said he was amazed by the phenomenon that the song had become. \"The thing that interests you in the video is the fact that you don't understand the lyrics. \"The first time I saw it was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in America and I just thought it was a bit of fun, but I didn't expect it to be as big as it was. \"Psy came into my Radio 1 show and The Guinness World Records presented him with a plaque for the most 'liked' YouTube video of all time and the amazing thing is he is just a guy, he hasn't tried to do any of this.\" D C Han, a South Korean hair stylist who worked in Gangnam before starting a business in London, added that he was proud to see the song become such a massive hit. \"I was amazed\" he told the BBC. \"K-Pop is getting stronger and stronger, everywhere in Asia they are listening to it - China, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

'Born gay' Mr Rudd was questioned about the issue by Christian pastor Matt Prater during a live Q&A session. Mr Prater asked Mr Rudd how he could support gay marriage as a Christian. \"If you call yourself a Christian, why don't you believe the words of Jesus in the Bible?\" he said. Mr Rudd responded: \"Well mate, if I was going to have that view, the Bible also says that slavery is a natural condition.\" \"Because St Paul said in the New Testament, slaves be obedient to your masters. And therefore we should have all fought for the Confederacy in the US Civil War.\" The fundamental principle of the New Testament was universal love, Mr Rudd added. \"If we get obsessed with a particular definition of that through a form of sexuality, then I think we are missing the centrality of what the Gospel... is all about.\" Mr Rudd, who was previously opposed to gay marriage, changed his position in May.

In comparison, sales on Cyber Monday, which is the biggest online shopping day in the US, hit $1.35bn, according to data analytics firm ComScore. Singles Day is held every year on 11 November. The day is also referred to as Double Eleven because of its date. James Bond, bragging and 'eating dirt' - China celebrates Singles Day Analysis: Celia Hatton, BBC News, Beijing Singles Day- Alibaba 80% share of China's total online shopping market 120,000 estimated orders each minute on 2015 Singles Day 73% of purchases in first hour made via mobile phone 12 hours time taken to beat 2014 whole-day record of $9.3bn The reaction to China's Singles Day shopping bonanza reflects the drama and excitement of China's capitalist holiday. \"I wanted two different coats, but they both sold out in the first three minutes of the sale!\", complained one young woman online. \"I spent 2,000RMB last night ($315; £207)\" exclaimed another. \"Now I'm going to have to eat dirt if I'm hungry because I'm broke!\" But don't mistake the rush to spend as a sign the Chinese economy is turning around. Many shoppers are well aware the economy is slowing. It is common for people to wait to spend on Singles Day to save money. New data supports nagging concerns about the economy. Inflation is down: non-food prices dropped 0.3% in October, indicating that consumption continues to fall in China - a long-term trend that Singles Day won't fix. Why China's big brands are cashing in on singles 'Power of Chinese consumption' Singles Day has grown tremendously since Alibaba began promoting it as a shopping day in 2009, and now includes many retailers such as rivals JD.com that stage sales promotions. This year, Alibaba said there would be more than 40,000 merchants and 30,000 brands from 25 countries selling goods on its platforms. More than 130 million users have already visited its marketplace app, Taobao, which exceeds the peak from last year. In the lead up to the event, the firm hosted a four-hour TV variety show featuring Chinese celebrities and Western entertainers such as British actor Daniel Craig of James Bond fame. American actor Kevin Spacey appeared as his character President Frank Underwood from the Netflix series House of Cards to wish shoppers a \"happy Singles' Day\" in a two minute video. Alibaba chief Executive Daniel Zhang had said in a statement that the event would mean \"the whole world will witness the power of Chinese consumption\". He promised consumers \"a new surprise every hour\" over the 24-hour marathon, especially mobile users. The firm said more than 27 million purchases came via mobile devices in the first hour. Although its competitors offered attractive discounts, Fangting Sun, China-based analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International said that consumers' attention was still focused on Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall.com. \"[It's] not only due to the wide choices and competitive prices, but also the heavy marketing campaigns especially the successful gala evening which invited lots of famous entertainment stars,\" she said. Kitty Fok, China manager for market research firm IDC said online shopping had become a comfortable channel for most consumers. \"China is a big market with close to one billion smart connected device users - it is a good news for both Alibaba and their competitors,\" she said. Massive scale Alibaba accounts for more than 80% of China's internet sales market. It predicts that 1.7 million couriers, 400,000 vehicles and 200 planes will be making deliveries of products that range from electronics goods to cosmetics despite slowing growth in China. Economists will be looking for clues about domestic consumption in Wednesday's sales as the world's second-biggest economy heads for its slowest growth in nearly a quarter of a century. Ms Sun of Euromonitor said the shopping event would not only stimulate domestic demand but also trade. \"Alibaba aims to both attract more international players selling products to China and the domestic players to expand to the overseas markets,\" she added.",

    "text": "By Rebecca MorelleScience reporter, BBC World Service Research has revealed that the marine mammals use a unique whistle to identify each other. A team from the University of St Andrews in Scotland found that when the animals hear their own call played back to them, they respond. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Vincent Janik, from the university's Sea Mammal Research Unit, said: \"(Dolphins) live in this three-dimensional environment, offshore without any kind of landmarks and they need to stay together as a group. \"These animals live in an environment where they need a very efficient system to stay in touch.\" Signature whistles It had been-long suspected that dolphins use distinctive whistles in much the same way that humans use names. Previous research found that these calls were used frequently, and dolphins in the same groups were able to learn and copy the unusual sounds. But this is the first time that the animals response to being addressed by their \"name\" has been studied. To investigate, researchers recorded a group of wild bottlenose dolphins, capturing each animal's signature sound. They then played these calls back using underwater speakers. \"We played signature whistles of animals in the group, we also played other whistles in their repertoire and then signature whistles of different populations - animals they had never seen in their lives,\" explained Dr Janik. The researchers found that individuals only responded to their own calls, by sounding their whistle back. The team believes the dolphins are acting like humans: when they hear their name, they answer. Dr Janik said this skill probably came about to help the animals to stick together in a group in their vast underwater habitat. He said: \"Most of the time they can't see each other, they can't use smell underwater, which is a very important sense in mammals for recognition, and they also don't tend to hang out in one spot, so they don't have nests or burrows that they return to.\" The researchers believe this is the first time this has been seen in an animal, although other studies have suggested some species of parrot may use sounds to label others in their group. Dr Janik said that understanding how this skill evolved in parallel in very different groups of animals could tell us more about how communication developed in humans.",

    "text": "Ms Zia, a former prime minister, denies misusing international funds donated to a charitable children's trust. The jail sentence may mean the 72-year-old is barred from parliamentary polls due later this year. The case is one of dozens pending against Ms Zia, a long-time rival of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Ms Zia has described the charges against her as politically motivated. As she went into court, she told weeping relatives: \"I will be back. Do not worry and be strong\", according to the Daily Star. The verdict was read out in a court in Dhaka after police used tear gas to disperse thousands of her supporters. Several police officers were injured in the violence, reports said. Ms Zia was led away to jail minutes after the verdict, bdnews24 reported. Her son Tarique Rahman was given 10 years in jail in absentia as he is in London. The same jail term was handed down to four of her aides. The trial against Ms Zia centred around $252,000 (£182,000) intended for an orphanage trust set up when she was prime minister. She was found guilty of embezzling the funds. Who is Khaleda Zia? By BBC Monitoring The charges against her had already led to her boycotting elections in 2014, which triggered widespread protests at the time. For Thursday's verdict there was heightened security across the capital and other cities. Many shops and schools were shut, reports said. According to Ms Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), hundreds of its supporters were arrested in the run-up to the verdict.",

    "text": "A warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. And US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said. The US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense. Tehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country. Iran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities. Why is the US sending additional forces? The Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats. The latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran. There are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq. The Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. Officials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities. The USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said. Iran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\". What's the state of US-Iran relations? Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Last month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass. Earlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed. It also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days. European powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse. Pressure or more? The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. In the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain. But Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran. The pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments. A difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

    "text": "By Sarah RainsfordBBC News, Moscow In his first detailed interview since his arrest, Mr Whelan has described life locked up alongside murderers and thieves as a \"very, very grim existence\" and called on his four governments to do more to get him out. The former US Marine has always insisted he is innocent, describing himself as a hostage of \"slimy\" Russian politics and a \"sham\" trial. A high-profile prisoner, who also holds British, Canadian and Irish passports thanks to family ties, he had been banking on some kind of prisoner swap soon after sentencing. That was more than six months ago. \"I get up in the morning and try to be as positive as I can,\" Mr Whelan told me from IK-17, his high-security prison eight hours drive south east of Moscow. But part of the camp has just been quarantined for a suspected Covid outbreak and he's being woken at night every two hours by prison guards who tear off his blanket and take his photograph, supposedly checking he hasn't tried to escape. The American says he's taking \"one day at a time\", not focusing on his daunting 16-year sentence. We had spoken before: snatched exchanges through the bars of his cage during custody hearings that the guards would quickly close down. But since his conviction Mr Whelan has called me from prison to relate his side of this spy story - a tale of deception and betrayal. \"I was getting ready and this person turned up, unexpected,\" Mr Whelan recalls his arrest in a Moscow hotel room two years ago. The \"person\" was one of many friends he had made in Russia since his first visit in 2006. He knew this man's family, he'd stayed at their house - even introduced him to his own parents. This friend enjoyed \"running around with a foreigner\", Mr Whelan remembers, showing him the sights. But he worked for Russia's FSB security service and, moments after he showed up at the hotel that day, his colleagues burst in and bundled the American to the floor. \"They grabbed me and pinned me down,\" Whelan tells me in one call. \"I thought at first it was some sort of joke or trick but it became real quite quickly.\" Paul Whelan says the entire \"ludicrous\" case against him was based on the testimony of this same friend. \"The story was that the DIA [US military intelligence] sent me to Moscow to pick up a flash drive with the names and photos of students from the border guard school,\" Mr Whelan says, arguing that such a low-tech mission was \"illogical\" in the internet age. He had supposedly paid for the secret data by wire transfer four months earlier, though Mr Whelan says that cash was a loan so his friend could buy his wife a new phone. \"The FSB just came up with a random story that doesn't make any sense,\" he says, and no concrete evidence was ever presented. \"It was really a farce. You hear about these things during the Soviet era, when people would then be taken out and shot. It's the same thing.\" It's not possible to verify Mr Whelan's account as even defence lawyers here have to sign a non-disclosure agreement in spy trials and the court hearings themselves were closed and top-secret. But Paul Whelan was led to believe that Russia wanted to trade him from the start. He says two names were always mentioned: arms dealer Victor Bout and Konstantin Yaroshenko, convicted on a drug smuggling charge - Russians in prison in the United States. Trading those two for a man who denies he's a spy seems a stretch. Even so, the US administration is engaging \"senior members\" of the Russian government in talks, according to the US ambassador to Moscow, although he won't give away any specifics. \"I'd like nothing more than to… pick up Paul, give him a hug and send him home to Michigan,\" John Sullivan told me last week. He's condemned the whole spy case as \"outrageous\" from the start and even drove to visit Mr Whelan in his prison camp, the first US ambassador through its gates. \"I have no higher priority in what's left of the Trump administration than to advocate for Paul and to do all we possibly can to get him released,\" Ambassador Sullivan said. \"But we haven't been able to come to terms that would be reasonable for any US administration to agree on.\" \"I love my brother, but you don't just swap a tourist for a bunch of bad guys. That's ridiculous!\" Paul Whelan's elder sister admits. \"People just love the idea of a swap: it speaks to novels from the 1940s, the foggy bridge.\" Elizabeth Whelan suggests the politicians will have to be more creative in this case, and preferably before Donald Trump leaves the White House on 20 January. \"We have to hope that the Russian Federation realises they have an opportunity right now to get something accomplished,\" she argues, given all Joe Biden's talk of \"getting tougher\" on Moscow. She's been trying to nudge things along, posting flash drives to the Russian foreign ministry stamped with the hashtag #freepaulwhelan. They were posted back. Once a globe-trotting security adviser, Paul Whelan now spends his days sewing prison uniforms in the camp \"workhouse\", his fate deeply entangled in the dire relationship between Moscow and the West. Nothing about that is getting any easier. \"I'm being patient and waiting. I'm not the only pebble on the beach, I know. But I also don't want to be here too long,\" he tells me, down the phone line. \"They've abducted a tourist. And I want to come home, see my family and live my life.\"",

    "text": "By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent Sheikh Mohammed, 69, who is a billionaire racehorse owner and has often been seen conversing with the Queen at Ascot, has posted a furious poem on Instagram accusing an unidentified woman of \"treachery and betrayal\". The Jordanian-born and British-educated Princess Haya, 45, married Sheikh Mohammed - owner of Godolphin horse racing stables - in 2004, becoming his sixth and \"junior wife\". Sheikh Mohammed reportedly has 23 children by different wives. Princess Haya fled initially this year to Germany to seek asylum. She is now said to be living in a £85m ($107m) town house in Kensington Palace Gardens, in central London, and preparing for a legal battle in the High Court. So what prompted her to flee her luxurious life in Dubai and why is she said to be \"afraid for her life\"? Sources close to her have said that Princess Haya had recently discovered disturbing facts behind the mysterious return to Dubai last year of Sheikha Latifa, one of the ruler's daughters. She fled the UAE by sea with the help of a Frenchman but was intercepted by armed men off the coast of India and returned to Dubai. Princess Haya then, along with the former Irish president Mary Robinson, defended Dubai's reputation over the incident. The Dubai authorities said the runaway Sheikha Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe in Dubai\". But human rights advocates said she was forcibly abducted against her will. Since then, it is alleged, Princess Haya has learnt new facts about the case and consequently came under increasing hostility and pressure from members of her husband's extended family until she no longer felt safe there. A source close to her said she fears she may now be abducted herself and \"rendered\" back to Dubai. The UAE embassy in London has declined to comment on what it says is a personal matter between two individuals. There is, however, a wider, international element to this story. Princess Haya, who was educated at Bryanston School in Dorset then University of Oxford, is thought likely to want to stay in the UK. If her estranged husband demands her return then this poses a diplomatic headache for Britain, which has close ties to the UAE. The case is also awkward for Jordan since Princess Haya is the half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah. Nearly a quarter of a million Jordanians work in the UAE, sending back remittances, and Jordan cannot afford a rift with Dubai. The BBC documentary Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Missing Princess will be re-broadcast on BBC Two at 23:15 BST on Thursday.",

Mr Assange, who arrived at the Ecuadorean embassy in the Knightsbridge area of London a year ago on 19 June, will be arrested if he leaves the building. Mr Patino said Mr Assange was prepared to stay inside the embassy for five years. 'Personal integrity' The Foreign Office said the two ministers talked for 45 minutes and while there had been no breakthrough, they had \"agreed to keep channels of communication open\". \"Ministers agreed that officials should establish a working group to find a diplomatic solution to the issue of Julian Assange, but no substantive progress was made,\" it said. \"The foreign secretary was clear once again that any resolution would need to be within the laws of the United Kingdom.\" Speaking via a translator, Mr Patino said: \"The Ecuadorean government will continue to ensure that he continues with the protection we have given him under asylum in our country, protecting his life, his personal integrity, and particularly his freedom of expression. \"The Ecuadorean government maintains that the reasons for which Ecuador granted asylum are still relevant, and therefore there is going to be no change in his circumstances.\" The UK government has previously said that it has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden. Mr Patino said Britain and Ecuador were using different legal justifications to support their positions. He said he had given a document to the British government setting out the basis on which Mr Assange should be allowed safe conduct to Ecuador. Mr Patino met Mr Assange on Sunday and said he was \"in good spirits\" despite the \"limitations of his accommodations\". The WikiLeaks founder sought asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy after the UK Supreme Court refused to reopen his appeal against extradition. He fears that if he is sent to Sweden, he may be extradited to the US, where he could face the death penalty for disclosing confidential government information.

    "text": "By Rebecca ThomasEntertainment reporter Her subsequent fight for survival and renewed vigour on recovery have proved an inspiration to millions around the world. Her courage has won her the Nobel Peace Prize and led to her becoming one of those rare individuals who can go by their first name alone. But behind her international profile is one of a normal teenager - and a daughter of a loving, united and inspirational family. It's this story, seemingly mundane yet so fundamental to who Malala is, that fascinated director Davis Guggenheim - maker of the Oscar-winning portrayal of US Democratic politician Al Gore in An Inconvenient Truth - and led to his latest documentary He Named Me Malala. Guggenheim uses one-to-one interviews, news footage and animation to paint an intimate portrait of the Yousafzais's past and present - and in particular the influence of Malala's father Ziauddin on her life. The director explains: \"People in the Swat Valley were being killed for standing up to the Taliban but there was this young girl who decided she was going to stand up to them. \"People don't fully understand this vital element of her story or where that determination comes from. \"My first instinct in making this movie was that it is very much about a family, about a father's love and about a girl who feels empowered to do amazing things. \"If you cover that story, it speaks to girls all over the world.\" Guggenheim filmed the Yousafzai family - Malala, her parents and two younger brothers - over 18 months. Much of the film takes place at the family's home in Birmingham, where they stayed following Malala's treatment at the city's hospital. But Guggenheim also shows Malala on trips to the Middle East and Africa as part of her work for the Malala Fund - an education charity she established with her father - visiting schools, refugee camps and addressing world leaders. Guggenheim is himself passionate about the importance of education and has made documentaries on the US school system. And as a father to two girls, he seems the perfect candidate to enter Malala's world - but it didn't prevent the nerves that preceded their first encounter. \"I was walking on eggshells,\" he says. \"But they were just hilarious and joyful. They tease each other and I found them remarkably enlightened and infinitely curious. I would leave their house invigorated. \"They have a certain freedom from having risked their lives and Malala lives her life even more fearlessly - the little things in life just disappear.\" Malala's brothers Khushal, 15, and Atal, 11, are lively boys, dreaming of glorious futures and tirelessly jibing and arguing with their sister. \"Look Malala, one day I will be an astronaut and a great sportsman and you will be known as my sister,\" says Atal. Her mother Toor Pekai is barely visible on camera due to her Pashtun sense of modesty but, says Guggenheim, she is \"100% in control. When a big decision is being made all eyes turn to her\". And Malala emerges as a just a normal teenager, struggling to get the best grades at school and bashfully doe-eyed over Roger Federer. It's an endearing picture but what truly stands out in this family story is Malala's bond with her father, who very visibly supports her in everything she wants to do. It's an attachment that began even before Malala was born. In Pakistan, Ziauddin belied his slight physique and the difficulties of a stammer to become a passionate social activist and a teacher, even establishing his own school. In a patriarchal society in which \"women are not known in public and their names are only known to family members\", he was adamant his daughter would be different and named her after a legendary 19th Century Pashtun warrior heroine, Malalai of Maiwund. \"Malalai had had a voice and I wanted my Malala to have the same - that she would have freedom and be brave and be known by her name,\" says Ziauddin. And it was immediately apparent she was special, he says. \"I hesitate to romanticise or make it something superstitious by saying she was born a saint or prophet but I felt an immediate attachment to her. I saw a light in her eyes. \"She was very mature and sensible and mindful of others and was loved by the whole community.\" Ziauddin put himself at considerable risk through his activism and received threats from the Taliban as a result. It caused Malala extreme anxiety yet she continued with her own activism and famously wrote a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, about life in the Swat Valley. Though acknowledging he was a role model for his daughter, Ziauddin says he feels no guilt for what ultimately happened to her. \"Guilt comes from when you do something sinful. When your basic human rights are violated and you don't stand up, that's a sin,\" he says. \"I didn't push my daughter; if I had she would have stopped. She would have said: 'Father you put me in a very bad situation, I got hit by a bullet, I am not going to do it anymore for you'. \"But she became more resilient, more committed and I've never heard her utter a single sigh or a single word which implies complaint or regret.\" And Malala - who has been left with some paralysis in her face and impaired hearing - vehemently backs her father. \"My father only gave me the name Malalai. He didn't make me Malalai. I chose this life,\" she says. As for the future, Ziauddin shows characteristic defiance. He is sure the family will go back to Pakistan for good, he says, despite the welcome and freedom they are all grateful to have received in the UK. And he has faith that his daughter will know the right path for herself to tread. Guggenheim fully agrees. \"When you do the DNA of Malala, she is a potent mix of both her parents. She gets her sense of mission from her father but her moral fibre, her religious clarity and forgiveness from her mother,\" he says. \"Anything is possible for Malala. She is wholly equipped to be a leader and she is completely unique in that, when the big decisions are being made about girls education, she is the only young person at the table. \"She's a voice for all those girls who don't have a voice. She'll be that for a very long time.\" He Named Me Malala opens in the UK on 6 November.",

Air India has relied on taxpayer-funded bailouts to stay operational - and the new buyer would take on about $5bn (£3.6bn) of debt. If privatisation goes ahead, it will be a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claims to be a reformist leader. But it is not a done deal. Such plans have been abandoned before, and unions have threatened wide-ranging protests if ministers push ahead this time. Once the country's only airline, Air India has lost market share to new entrants and suffered from a reputation for poor service and cancelled flights. It has not turned a profit since 2007 - but with India seeing passenger growth of around 20% per year and analysts saying the Indian market is vastly underserved - it could still be a tempting prospect for would-be buyers.

Bidders are allowed to make separate offers for the four divisions - or for a combination of them. Who'll buy it? International routes are the most lucrative part of the Air India business, with slots at major international airports including London Heathrow and New York JFK. IndiGo, India's biggest airline, has said that it would like to carve out Air India's international passenger airline operations - to add to the seven international destinations it already flies to. But that is not an option currently on the table - and Indigo said it would also \"evaluate\" the option of taking on all of the airline business and see if it was \"economically feasible for us to go down that path\". \"At the end of the day, this exercise is not about becoming bigger for the sake of being bigger - it is all about profitable growth,\" co-founder Rahul Bhatia said. But he was clear IndiGo was not looking at buying all of Air India's businesses and subsidiaries. \"In our view, that would be a herculean task which would at best be a very challenging proposition and at worst an impossible task, unless an organisation is willing to fund large losses for a very long time,\" Mr Bhatia said. Another potential buyer is Vistara - the joint venture airline run between India's Tata Group and Singapore Airlines. Earlier this month, Singapore Airlines general manager David Lim told the BBC that it was \"open\" to an Air India bid. \"We haven't closed the doors and when that happens we will look at it\", he said Indian rules state that majority ownership of any national airline needs to be with an Indian national. So while international carriers can make a bid - the biggest stake they can hold is 49%. Jet Airways, another Indian carrier, is also likely to take a serious look at an offer - perhaps in partnership with an international carrier. Media reports suggest Air France and Delta may be interested. The government has waived some of the criteria for existing Indian airline operators to make bids - relating to net worth and recent profitability - so long as they bid as part of a consortium. Qatar Airways was another international airline linked with buying a stake in Air India, but it has since denied any interest. Any caveats? The eventual buyer of Air India may eventually have to list the airline on the stock exchange - which would be a clear incentive to make it profitable within a fixed time frame. It is likely that at this point, the government would then sell its remaining 24% in the business. The buyer will be taking on about $5bn of debt. However, this is only about half of what the airline owes. So in effect the buyer is getting a smaller proportion of the debt than it might expect for a 76% stake - which might make things more appealing. What's the time line? Would-be bidders have until 14 May to make initial proposals. Shortlisted bidders will be informed by 28 May.",

    "text": "Fighting raged for several hours after the jails - Abu Ghraib to the west of the capital and Taji to the north - came under attack. Mortar fire and suicide bombs were used to gain access to the jails, whose inmates include al-Qaeda prisoners. At least 20 members of the security forces were killed as they struggled to regain control. A senior Iraqi MP, Hakim Al-Zamili, said that about 500 prisoners had escaped from the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. Most of them were senior members of al-Qaeda who had been sentenced to death, he told Reuters news agency. \"It's obviously a terrorist attack carried out by al-Qaeda to free convicted terrorists with al-Qaeda,\" the agency quoted an unnamed security official as saying. Abu Ghraib was used to torture opponents of the regime during Saddam Hussein's rule, and its infamy increased in 2004 when photographs were published showing detainees being abused by US guards. Mortar rounds The prison attacks were launched at about 21:30 (18:30 GMT) on Sunday night. Gunmen fired mortar rounds at the prisons, and then used car bombs at the entrances. The situation was eventually brought back under control on Monday morning, with the use of military helicopters. Iraqi authorities initially denied any prisoners had escaped in the attacks, but now acknowledge \"some\" prisoners escaped. Interior Minister Wissam al-Firaiji said the attackers, whom he called \"terrorists,\" had been well-armed. \"The attack against Taji jail alone was carried out by nine suicide bombers and three car bombs driven by suicide bombers,\" he told reporters. \"The attackers also lobbed more than 100 mortar shells,\" he added. \"The inmates are now under control.\" Northern flashpoint Elsewhere in Iraq, two attacks on security forces in the northern city of Mosul killed 33 people, officials said. A man drove a vehicle packed with explosives up to a military convoy. \"A suicide bomber was following the convoy and when it stopped in the middle of road he detonated his vehicle right behind it,\" a policeman told Reuters news agency. A group of soldiers and at least two passers-by were among the dead, officials said. A second attack was launched on a group of policemen, several of whom were killed when gunmen stormed their checkpoint. Mosul, 360km (220 miles) north-west of Baghdad, is one of Iraq's major flashpoints. Insurgent groups such as al-Qaeda have found the city a fertile recruiting ground. It is the capital of the Sunni-dominated Nineveh province. There were further deadly attacks in the city of Kirkuk and in Anbar province, according to Agence France Press. Violence up It is unclear who was behind the incidents, but there has been a recent escalation in violence across Iraq. United Nations figures released earlier in July showed that more than 2,500 Iraqis were killed in violent attacks in the three months from April to June. The current spate of attacks makes this the most dangerous time in Iraq since the peak of the anti-US insurgency in 2006-7, and certainly since the US withdrawal in 2011. Some of the country's minority Sunni population feel increasingly marginalised by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's Shia-led government. Shia forces have targeted Sunni protesters, and insurgents linked to al-Qaeda and its \"Islamic State in Iraq\" have been carrying out bomb attacks on government institutions and Shia population centres. The spark in violence has raised fears of a return to the levels of sectarian killing seen following the US invasion ten years ago, and has led commentators to discuss once again the prospect of partition along community lines. The conflict in neighbouring Syria, itself increasingly taking the form of a Sunni-Shia sectarian conflict, is further straining community relations in Iraq. Militants have previously targeted Iraqi prisons in similar operations, though Sunday night's breakout appears to be far larger in scale than previous incidents. Prisons themselves have been a focus for Sunni grievances, with protesters saying inmates have been unfairly detained and in some cases tortured. Al-Qaeda's affiliated group in Iraq has previously said it would target the justice system, AFP reports.",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being \"irresponsible\". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. \"First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence,\" it said. \"Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. \"Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it.\" At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. 'Community standard' The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the \"world in which we live\". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. \"We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content,\" it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. \"The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask,\" the user wrote. \"She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply.\" An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video \"did not violate our community standard on graphic violence\". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: \"It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents.\" Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was \"unhappy\" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's \"fully exposed breast\". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: \"Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting.\" But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: \"This content is currently unavailable.\" In response Mr Cameron tweeted: \"I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children.\" Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. \"The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material,\" he said in a statement. \"In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate.\" London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. \"If they've taken it down I welcome that,\" said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. \"But I want to find out more and look into this further.\" Age limits Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: \"Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence,\" it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. \"While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value,\" a spokesman added. \"In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site.\"",

    "text": "Fergus WalshMedical correspondent Both treatments, for advanced melanoma, are designed to enable the immune system to recognise and target tumours. The findings were released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago. The experimental drugs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, block the biological pathway cancers use to disguise themselves from the immune system. Advanced melanoma - skin cancer which has spread to other organs - has proved very hard to treat. Until a few years ago average survival was around six months. Improved survival In a trial of 411 patients evaluating pembrolizumab - 69% of patients survived at least a year. The drug, which used to be known as MK-3475, is also being tested against other tumour types which use the same mechanism to block attack from the immune system. Dr David Chao, consultant oncologist at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, is conducting trials in both melanoma and lung cancer patients. He said: \"Pembrolizumab looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy.\" One of his patients, Warwick Steele, aged 64, has been receiving infusions of pembrolizumab every three weeks since October. Before the treatment started he could barely walk because the melanoma had spread to one of his lungs and he found it hard to breathe. \"I got tired simply standing up and was literally too exhausted to shave. But now I feel back to normal and can do gardening and go shopping\". Scans of his lungs - shown above - reveal that after just three infusions, the drug appears to have completely cleared the cancer from his lung. Combination therapy The other drug, nivolumab, was tested in combination with an existing licensed immunotherapy, ipilimumab. In a trial of 53 patients, survival was 85% after one year, and 79% after two years. John Wagstaff, Prof of medical oncology at Swansea College of Medicine is part of a larger trial of these two drugs. He said: \"I am convinced that this is a breakthrough in treating melanoma. \"The trial is still \"blinded\" so we don't know what treatments the patients are getting, but we have seen some spectacular responses.\" Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: \"It's exciting to see the range of new treatments that are emerging for people with advanced melanoma.\" But doctors are urging caution. The results which have been published are of Phase I, early stage trials. Much larger Phase III trials are underway involving many UK hospitals. Only when they report, in about a year's time, can clinicians be sure what the likely benefits will be. Like all drugs, the experimental treatments have side effects. Warwick Steele said he experienced night sweats and even had two brief blackouts when on the new drug. But he said it was well worth it, and doctors were now treating these symptoms.",

    "text": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced criticism for failing to help citizens trapped in the Covid-ravaged nation. The ban sparked further anger after the government said Australians seeking to fly home could face jail or fines. Mr Morrison later played down this threat. On Friday, he said they would begin by bringing back \"vulnerable\" citizens. About 900 Australians are registered with the government in this group. More than 9,000 Australians are in India in total. Mr Morrison said he expects the travel ban to end on 15 May. However, his government will wait until next week to make a decision on whether to restart commercial flights from India, which is how most stranded Australians will be able to get home. Even then, many fear they may find it difficult to secure a seat on a flight, or afford the costly fares. The India restrictions, which began on 27 April, led to the cancellation of two official evacuation flights that week. The ban's wider impact has also been heavily criticised. The tough measures were introduced due to India's escalating Covid crisis. The country is seeing more than 300,000 cases reported each day and hospitals continue to run out of oxygen. Meanwhile Australia's Trade Minister, Dan Tehan, has said the country's borders may not fully reopen until the middle or second half of 2022. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Tehan said he was hopeful that more travel corridors would be opened, like the one between Australia and New Zealand. Who will get to fly back first from India? Mr Morrison said the government was planning three repatriation flights in the second half of May, which would bring back Australians who have registered as \"vulnerable\". That group may grow. As the situation in India worsened in the week since the travel ban was announced, the number of vulnerable Australians jumped from 600 people to 900. Evacuees will be taken to the Howard Springs quarantine facility in the Northern Territory, which will be expanded to provide 2,000 beds by next week. Australia initially justified the ban by arguing the high rate of infections seen in arrivals from India was putting the quarantine system under stress. But on Friday, Mr Morrison said the ban had worked to reduce the number of cases in quarantine \"back to more manageable levels\". \"[We] will be at a level by 15 May to ensure, that as planned, we will be able to return to having those repatriation flights from India.\" How has the public reacted? While Australians have been largely supportive of the government's strict border policies over the past year, the India travel ban sparked significant outcry. Public anger fixated on the idea that the government had left its citizens in danger, and would punish them if they attempted to return. Critics - including legal and medical experts - accused the government of abandoning its people. Many Indian-Australians, among others, also argued the government had enacted a \"racist\" policy given similarly harsh restrictions weren't applied to arrivals from other high-risk nations. One prominent voice, cricketer-turned-commentator Michael Slater, wrote a popular tweet accusing the prime minister of having \"blood on your hands\". \"Take your private jet and come and witness dead bodies on the street,\" Slater wrote in another tweet. He was one of about 40 Australians in India for the Indian Premier League cricket competition which was suspended this week. Cricket Australia announced on Wednesday that the remaining cricketers had been moved out of the country, and would get a chartered flight home after the ban is lifted. Australia has enjoyed near-zero infection rates due to strict border and quarantine controls, and contact-tracing measures. Sydney recorded two new local cases this week, prompting authorities to reimpose mask-wearing rules and limits on group gatherings.",

In recent months, hardline Buddhist groups have mounted a campaign against Muslim and Christian targets. Several houses were also damaged in Saturday's clashes. Two of the injured were policemen guarding the mosque. A Muslim resident of the area said that a mob threw stones at the mosque when worshippers were performing evening prayers, the BBC's Azzam Ameen reports from Colombo. The police and special task force commandos were dispatched to the area and have been able to bring the situation under control, a police spokesman told the BBC. Buddhists monks had reportedly protested against the presence of the mosque but had agreed to allow Muslims to continue praying there until the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. But area Muslims says Sri Lanka's religious affairs ministry had given them permission to continue using the site and had also provided special police security due to the threat of possible attacks. Fears of persecution The past year has seen mounting religious tension in the country as hardline Buddhist groups have attacked mosques and Muslim-owned businesses, as well as churches and clergy. In February, one group also called for the abolition of the Muslim halal system of certifying foods and other goods. Buddhist hardliners accuse Muslims and Christians of promoting extremism and trying to convert Buddhists to their own faiths. Both Muslims and Christians have denied the accusations, correspondents report. The Buddhist Sinhalese community makes up three-quarters of Sri Lanka's population of 20 million. During Sri Lanka's bitter civil war, the Muslims - a small Tamil-speaking minority, about 9% of the population - kept a low profile, but many now fear that ethnic majority hardliners are trying to target them.",

    "text": "By Juliana LiuHong Kong correspondent, BBC News When I was three years old, after months of begging, my parents finally gave in to my pleas for a puppy. The day that my uncle, a lorry driver, brought me a fuzzy yellow mongrel from my grandmother's mountainous, faraway home was the happiest of my young life. I named him \"Doggie\", and we immediately became inseparable. As an only child born in 1979 at the beginning of China's one-child policy, I had always been alone, and Doggie became my best friend. He loved running around outside our one-room flat, gobbling up left-over rice and snuggling near the coal fire. But these halcyon days did not last. After just one winter, my parents told me Doggie had to go. In Chinese cities in the early 1980s owning a pet was considered highly undesirable, bourgeois behaviour. None of my neighbours had one. It was also not entirely legal. There was no access to animal vaccines or vets, so pets could pose a public health risk. One day, my mother announced we were going shopping - and when we returned a few hours later Doggie was no more. He had been strung up by the legs in our communal yard, and was soon turned into a stew, complete with herbs and hard-boiled eggs. No-one paid any attention to my tears. I heard the neighbours say I would soon forget the whole thing. They, on the other hand, were in a celebratory mood. In the years before China's economic boom, when some food was still rationed, it was rare to have the chance to feast on a whole animal. I refused to eat the stew - and I have never eaten dog in my life. In China, the tradition of dog-eating goes back far beyond written history. Along with pigs, oxen, goats, horses and fowl, dogs are one of the six animals domesticated during the Stone Age. On the other hand, it is not the kind of thing that is eaten every day. It is a speciality meat, commonly believed to confer strength, vigour and virility on the eater. How dog is eaten Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop writes: Judging by the sporadic waves of outrage about dog-eating in China, you might think it was one of the pillars of the Chinese diet. Actually, however, the consumption of dog meat is extremely marginal: it's seldom seen in markets and on restaurant menus, and most Chinese people eat it rarely, if at all. Dogs, like pigs, have been reared for their meat in China since the Neolithic age, but in modern times their flesh is regarded as a delicacy in just a few areas, such as Hunan and Guizhou. Even in these places, it tends to be eaten only occasionally, and in certain seasons. According to traditional Chinese medicine, dog is a \"heating\" meat which can offer a useful energy boost in midwinter, but is best avoided after the lunar new year. In culinary terms, dog meat is normally blanched or soaked before cooking to dispel the earthier, heavier aspects of its flavour. It is then, typically, made into slow-cooked soups and stews seasoned with ginger, spring onion, rice wine and spices, although it may also be roasted, or served cold as an appetiser. The tender meat of puppies is favoured over that of older dogs. In the course of many years of studying Chinese cuisine, I've only eaten dog meat on a handful of occasions. The first time, it reminded me of pork; the second, in a fiendishly spicy Hunanese stew, it recalled the taste of lamb. About 716 million pigs are slaughtered in the country every year, and 48 million cattle. The number of dogs slaughtered is far lower - one animal rights group puts the figure at about 10 million. But where do these dogs come from? According to some researchers, many are pets - like Doggie, except they have been stolen from their owners. As dogs were arriving for the dog-meat festival at Yulin in Guangxi province this week, Peter Li of Humane Society International saw no animals with quarantine inspection certificates to indicate they had been farmed. \"All of them can be suspected to be stolen urban pets, rural guard dogs and stray dogs and cats,\" he says. A four-year inquiry into the dog-meat industry by Animals Asia also concluded that most dogs eaten in China are stolen. \"During the entire investigation, we found no evidence of any large-scale breeding facilities, where 100-plus dogs were bred and raised,\" says the report published earlier this month. \"The difficulty of large-scale breeding of dogs for food and the greed for profit give rise to stealing, snatching from the streets and even poisoning of dogs.\" But Li says there is mounting pressure on Chinese authorities to take action against the eating of pets - and that society is turning against the idea of eating dog altogether. There were far fewer stalls selling dog and cat meat at the Yulin festival this year than in 2014, he says. \"The overall attitude is against dog eating. China has 130 million dogs, of which 27 million are urban pets. That's a big number of pet owners. \"The younger generation, born in the 1990s, is not tolerant of animal cruelty.\" In 2014, animal rights activists intercepted 18 lorries carrying dogs intended for eating, resulting in the rescue of some 8,000 animals, he says. The Chinese media often carries stories of such rescues, in which activists force vehicles to stop and pool money to purchase the animals. He dates the rise of animal protection activism in China to 2011, the same year when, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than the countryside. City dwellers, he says, view dogs and cats more as pets, rather than as working animals - guard dogs, for example - or sources of meat. In May, on a visit to Shanghai, I saw a sight that delighted me. While strolling on the Bund, I stopped a young tourist named Yang Yang who was carrying her tiny, fox-like dog in a sling on her chest, the way I normally carry my human baby. \"Oh, this way I can take him into restaurants and on airplanes,\" she explained. \"Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed in with me. Where I go, he goes.\" All three of us posed for a photo in front of Shanghai's iconic skyline. How I wish more people had taken this attitude three decades ago. My parents, now utterly embarrassed about having allowed my pet to be cooked, generally avoid the topic entirely. But when I was five years old, my father left China to study abroad and the very first gift he sent me was a fuzzy, yellowish stuffed puppy. I named him Doggie. To this day, wherever I go, he is with me. Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",

    "text": "Speaking after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it was not increasing emergency funding to Greek banks, Mr Tsipras said Greek deposits were safe. Greece is due to make a €1.6bn (£1.1bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday - the same day that its current bailout expires. Greece risks default and moving closer to a possible exit from the eurozone. Greeks have been queuing to withdraw money from cash machines over the weekend, and the Bank of Greece said it was making \"huge efforts\" to keep the machines stocked. Greek banks are expected to stay shut until 7 July, two days after Greece's planned referendum on the terms it had been offered by international creditors for receiving fresh bailout money. The Athens stock exchange will also be closed on Monday. Greece's capital controls Capital controls - how do they work? Eurozone finance ministers blamed Greece for breaking off the talks, and the European Commission took the unusual step on Sunday of publishing proposals by European creditors that it said were on the table at the time. But Greece described creditors' terms as \"not viable\", and asked for an extension of its current deal until after the vote was completed. \"[Rejection] of the Greek government's request for a short extension of the programme was an unprecedented act by European standards, questioning the right of a sovereign people to decide,\" Mr Tsipras on Sunday said in a televised address. \"This decision led the ECB today to limit the liquidity available to Greek banks and forced the Greek central bank to suggest a bank holiday and restrictions on bank withdrawals.\" The Greek prime minister said that wages and pensions, as well as bank deposits, were guaranteed. He also said he had sent a new request for an extension to the bailout. \"I am awaiting their immediate response to a fundamental request of democracy,\" added. Analysis: Robert Peston, BBC economics editor The temporary closure of banks in Greece, and the introduction of capital controls, is very bad news for Greece. Greek people will have less money to spend and business less to invest; so an already weak economy will probably return to deep recession. As for the impact on the rest of the eurozone, corporate treasurers and wealthy individuals will wake up on Monday wondering if their money is safe in the banks of other weaker eurozone economies. Greece's bank holiday from hell The German and British governments advised tourists to take plenty of euros to Greece in case they had trouble withdrawing money. Following the news from Greece the euro fell by nearly two US cents against the dollar in early Asia Pacific trade, Reuters reported. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Barack Obama spoke about the crisis by phone, agreeing that it was \"critically important\" to help Greece remain in the eurozone, the White House said. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told French TV: \"We must do everything so that Greece stays in the eurozone. \"Doing everything, that means respecting Greece and democracy, but it's also about respecting European rules. So Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table.'' Sunday's developments come after several days of particular turbulence in Greece's debt crisis. Weekend of turmoil The current ceiling for the ECB's emergency funding - Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) - is €89bn (£63bn). It is thought that virtually all that money has been disbursed. The ECB was prepared to risk restricting ELA because the failure of the bailout talks cast new doubt on the viability of Greek banks - some of their assets depend on the government being able to meet its financial commitments, the BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker reports. He adds that it is a fundamental principle of central banking that while you do lend to banks that are temporary difficulty, you only do so if they are solvent.",

    "text": "By Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi He didn't get tested for coronavirus. Instead he took anti-fever medication for five days. But the fever persisted, and soon he had difficulty breathing. His family asked him to get tested, but he refused. His rationale was that there was no way he could have contracted Covid-19 because he had hardly stepped out of his house in Delhi, and he had not met anybody who had the virus or was even suspected of having it. Eight days after the symptoms first appeared, his condition deteriorated. He was rushed to hospital, where he tested positive. \"I survived, but doctors told me that any more delay in hospitalisation could have cost me my life,\" he says. Mr Kumar hasn't been able to track the source of his infection and is still unsure how he caught it. Experts say there are many such cases - proof that \"full-blown\" community transmission is happening in India. But the government refuses to accept that community transmission has begun, saying there is no clear definition of the term, and each country can define it based on local conditions. So far, Kerala and West Bengal are the only two states to accept that they have entered this stage. But global understanding on the subject is simple: when the source of infection can't be traced in a large number of cases, it's safe to define it as community transmission. The WHO's guidelines say the same: \"community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases\". This is certainly happening in India, according to Dr Arvind Kumar, chairman of the Centre for Chest Surgery at Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital. He says that more and more patients are turning up at hospitals whose source of infection cannot be traced. And, he adds, the rising case numbers support this. India has recorded more than 1.2 million cases and nearly 29,000 deaths. \"These stats don't lie,\" Dr Kumar says. \"You have state after state where infection rates are going up rapidly. There is no point in denying what is right in front of you.\" But the government disagrees. A top doctor from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) recently acknowledged that India was in the community transmission phase, but the IMA retracted the statement two days later, saying it was the doctor's \"personal opinion\". The turnaround baffled many. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says the government needs to listen to doctors and experts, and acknowledge the evidence. There is no denying that the virus is more widespread now than a month ago. More states - such as Andhra Pradesh and Bihar - and more districts beyond dense urban areas are now reporting a surge in cases. Many of them were not prepared because they largely relied on quarantining and testing people coming from other states to halt the spread. But they did not take enough steps to curb the spread locally. Even the former strategy had gaps, because it's not possible to completely man porous borders between states. And many states also lack the means to track and test each person entering their territory. Dr Jameel adds that there was a sense that the virus could be contained within big cities and certain hotspot states, preventing it from reaching other parts of the country. \"That hasn't happened and now Covid-19 is spreading unchecked,\" he says. The virus is travelling fast, often leaving no trace to establish the chain of transmission. Dr Jameel points out that the government's own survey showed that 40% of the respondents who had respiratory illnesses did not know how they got sick. \"We have enough evidence to accept there is community transmission,\" he says. But experts say this didn't happen overnight. Rather, it happened over several weeks as the government continued to deny it. \"We had localised community transmission in early stages of the pandemic. But now it's spread across the country, it's there for everybody to see,\" Dr Kumar says. So why is the government so reluctant to accept the obvious? Experts say they \"can only guess\" since the government hasn't said much on the matter, and has not released an official definition of the term to support its stance. One reason could be that the government sees accepting the existence of community transmission as a failure of its policies. The government can't be blamed for community transmission, argues Dr Jameel, adding that it needs to be more forthright with data and accept what science proves. He adds that community transmission is often a possibility with such a highly infectious virus in densely populated countries like India. Denials only add more pressure, say experts, and spark an unnecessary debate around the topic. And the argument is pointless now, according to leading epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant, who has worked with the government. He says \"we have to keep improving our strategy\", whether we call it community transmission or not. \"India is a large country - you may control the virus in one state and then another state will flare up. So, we really don't need a definition to understand the ground reality,\" he says. \"It's getting worse, and that is the harsh truth.\" But accepting community transmission may require significant policy changes. The WHO says \"individual case identification, contact tracing, and quarantining are no longer necessary\" in a \"large-scale community transmission scenario\". Instead it advises countries to focus on tracking the geographical spread of the virus through data and deploy healthcare facilities accordingly. Dr Kant says it's possible that the government may not want to announce a shift in policy at the moment. Possibly because it's taken months for governments - both federal and state - to ramp up testing, and to implement test and trace protocols. The other challenge is that the pandemic is in different stages in different parts of India, which makes it difficult to overhaul the policy altogether. \"But it still doesn't justify their constant denials. They need to say what their long-term approach is or what their definitions are about community transmission,\" he adds. The public has a right to know, Dr Kant says, and the government should be transparent.",

    "text": "By James Landale & Vinnie O'DowdBBC News Aid workers said the men would trade food and lifts for sexual favours. Despite warnings about the abuse three years ago, a new report shows it is continuing in the south of the country. UN agencies and charities said they had zero tolerance of exploitation and were not aware of any cases of abuse by partner organisations in the region. Aid workers told the BBC that the exploitation is so widespread that some Syrian women are refusing to go to distribution centres because people would assume they had offered their bodies for the aid they brought home. One worker claimed that some humanitarian agencies were turning a blind eye to the exploitation because using third parties and local officials was the only way of getting aid into dangerous parts of Syria that international staff could not access. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) conducted an assessment of gender based violence in the region last year and concluded that humanitarian assistance was being exchanged for sex in various governorates in Syria. The report, entitled \"Voices from Syria 2018\", said: \"Examples were given of women or girls marrying officials for a short period of time for 'sexual services' in order to receive meals; distributors asking for telephone numbers of women and girls; giving them lifts to their houses 'to take something in return' or obtaining distributions 'in exchange for a visit to her home' or 'in exchange for services, such as spending a night with them'.\" It added: \"Women and girls 'without male protectors', such as widows and divorcees as well as female IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons), were regarded as particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\" Yet this exploitation was first reported three years ago. Danielle Spencer, a humanitarian adviser working for a charity, heard about the allegations from a group of Syrian women in a refugee camp in Jordan in March 2015. She conducted a focus group with some of these women who told her how men from local councils in areas such as Dara'a and Quneitra had offered them aid for sex. \"They were withholding aid that had been delivered and then using these women for sex,\" Ms Spencer said. \"Some had experienced it themselves, some were very distraught. \"I remember one woman crying in the room and she was very upset about what she had experienced. Women and girls need to be protected when they are trying to receive food and soap and basic items to live. The last thing you need is a man who you're supposed to trust and supposed to be receiving aid from, then asking you to have sex with him and withholding aid from you.\" She continued: \"It was so endemic that they couldn't actually go without being stigmatised. It was assumed that if you go to these distributions, that you will have performed some kind of sexual act in return for aid.\" A few months later, in June 2015, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) surveyed 190 women and girls in Dara'a and Quneitra. Its report suggested about 40% had said sexual violence took place when they were accessing services, including humanitarian aid. An IRC spokesman said: \"The assessment concluded that sexual violence was a widespread concern, including when seeking access to various types of services across southern Syria. These services included the distribution of humanitarian aid.\" The reports - both of which have been seen by the BBC - were presented at a meeting of UN agencies and international charities hosted by the UNPFA in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 15 July 2015. As a result of this meeting, some aid agencies tightened up their procedures. The IRC said: \"Within our own operations, we launched new programmes and systems to better protect women and girls in southern Syria. Those programmes continue to be funded by a range of donors, including DfID (the UK's Department for International Development).\" Abuse 'ignored for years' The charity Care expanded its monitoring team in Syria, set up a complaints mechanism and no longer hands over aid to local councils. It also asked various UN agencies, including the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to investigate further and set up new reporting mechanisms. But Care was refused permission to carry out studies in Jordanian refugee camps. Ms Spencer claims the aid sector turned a blind eye to ensure that aid still got into southern Syria. \"Sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls has been ignored, it's been known about and ignored for seven years,\" she said. \"The UN and the system as it currently stands have chosen for women's bodies to be sacrificed. \"Somewhere there has been a decision made that it is OK for women's bodies to continue to be used, abused, violated in order for aid to be delivered for a larger group of people.\" Another source who attended the July 2015 meeting on behalf of one of the UN agencies told the BBC: \"There were credible reports of sexual exploitation and abuse going on during the cross-border aid delivery and the UN didn't make any serious moves to address it or end it.\" A spokesman for UNFPA said it had heard of possible cases of exploitation and abuse of Syrian women in southern Syria from Care. It said it had not received any allegations of abuse or exploitation from the two NGOs it works with in southern Syria. The spokesman also made clear that UNFPA does not work with local councils as implementing partners. A spokesman for the children's charity Unicef confirmed it was present at the July 2015 meeting. The charity said it carried out a review of its local partners and contractors in southern Syria and is not aware of any allegations against them at this point. But it accepted that sexual exploitation was a serious risk in Syria and said it was introducing a community-based complaints mechanism and more training for its partners. A DfID spokesman said it was not aware of any cases like this involving UK aid. \"There are mechanisms already in place to raise issues of abuse and exploitation,\" the department said. \"DfID partners in Syria use third party monitors to verify UK aid distributed in Syria.\" Zero tolerance The spokesman added that any systematic abuse should be picked up by those monitors and reported to DfID. An Oxfam spokeswoman said it had not been working with local councils delivering aid in the south of Syria in the run up to 2015 and was not doing so today. \"Our work inside Syria has been largely focused on providing large-scale hardware for supplying water to Syrian communities rather than targeting aid at individuals or specific households,\" she said. \"We did not receive reports about sexual exploitation around aid delivery in 2015, but have a zero tolerance policy on such abuse.\" A spokesman for the UNHCR, Andrej Mahecic, said it was \"important to understand that in any aid emergency there is a risk of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, and to abuse somebody who is in need of assistance is despicable\". He added that while the allegations relating to 2015 were \"incomplete, fragmented and unsubstantiated\" the UN nevertheless had taken some action when they first surfaced. He said the UN refugee agency had no access to the area of southern Syria where the abuse was alleged to have taken place, but that the agency did seek to bring local partners to Jordan for training. He continued: \"The mere suggestion that the UN can somehow control the situation in a war zone is rather simplistic and disconnected from the reality of what an aid operation looks like in an open and fierce conflict.\"",

    "text": "The academy - which runs the Oscars - said this was done in accordance with its standards of conduct. TV star Cosby was convicted of sexual assault last month. Oscar-winning director Polanski admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Producer Harvey Weinstein was kicked out last year, following numerous allegations of sexual assault. Less than a year after the downfall of the producer the #MeToo movement is catching up with other men who abused their power, the BBC's James Cook in Los Angeles reports. Neither Cosby nor Polanski have publicly reacted to the academy's decision. Cosby's wife, Camille, described his conviction as \"mob justice, not real justice\". \"This tragedy must be undone not just for Bill Cosby, but for the country,\" she said. What did the academy say? The prestigious organisation made the announcement on Thursday - two days after its board members voted on the issue. In a statement, it said its board \"has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organisation's Standards of Conduct\". \"The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity,\" it added. Only four people are known to have been expelled in its 91-year history. The first was actor Carmine Caridi, who had his membership revoked in 2004 after he allegedly sent confidential film preview videos to a friend which ended up online. On social media, many people have been asking what took the academy so long to take action against Polanski, who has been honoured in the decades since he admitted to statutory rape. Polanski's Oscar nominations since his 1977 guilty plea What did Polanski do? The unlawful sex case against Polanski, now aged 84, has dragged on for more than 40 years. Polanski admitted unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was a minor in 1977, and served 42 days in prison, but later fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. He has French and Polish citizenship, and has evaded various extradition attempts by US authorities. France - where he lives - does not extradite its own citizens. A Polish court also rejected a US request when he was filming in Krakow in 2015. The Swiss authorities also turned down a US warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months. Last year, he was picked to head the jury at the Césars, the French equivalent of the Oscars. He stepped down after the move sparked outrage. Last year, Ms Geimer told a US court she had forgiven Polanski and wanted to move on. But the court refused her plea. Why now? By James Cook, BBC News, Los Angeles Why now? That's the question, isn't it? For Bill Cosby, the answer appears obvious. A criminal conviction seems to be the standard which was applied in this case: expulsion from the academy came just one week after a guilty verdict. Roman Polanski's expulsion, by very stark contrast, comes more than 2,000 weeks after he pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. Not only that but Harvey Weinstein was expelled without a criminal conviction although he faces (and denies) allegations of rape. So why did it take Hollywood more than 40 years to decide that the statutory rape of a 13-year-old was beneath its precious \"values of respect for human dignity\"? The academy recently implemented revised standards of conduct for its 8,400 members, including a provision to suspend or expel those who \"compromise the integrity\" of the organisation. The real answer though does not lie in bureaucracy but in shame. The industry has been shamed into action by the disinfecting sunlight of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The problem for the academy is that this harsh glare is shining on many other members and with each expulsion the pressure grows to act in those cases too. What about Cosby's conviction? In April, Cosby, 80, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison. He was on trial for drugging and assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004. It was the second time the actor had stood trial for the allegations, after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict in 2017. Cosby starred in sitcom The Cosby Show, which was a global hit and ran from 1984-92. Cosby was widely known as \"America's Dad\" for his fatherly role in the comedy. At one point, he was the highest-paid actor in the US.",

    "text": "Mr Lucas said: \"It's now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of film-makers.\" In a statement announcing the purchase, Disney said it planned to release a new Star Wars film, episode seven, in 2015. That will be followed by episodes eight and nine and then one new movie every two or three years, the company said. The last Star Wars film was 2005's Revenge of the Sith, and Disney said it believed there was \"substantial pent-up demand\". James Burns, founder of fansite Jedi News in the UK, said: \"It is fantastic that we are going to be seeing more Star Wars films as George Lucas has said many times that there wouldn't be any more.\" Disney will pay about half in cash and half in stock, issuing 40 million Disney shares in the transaction. The deal follows Disney's acquisitions of Pixar studios for $7.4bn in 2006 and Marvel comics for $4.2bn in 2009. \"Our valuation of Lucasfilm is roughly comparable to the value we placed on Marvel when we announced that acquisition in 2009,\" Disney said, adding that the valuation was almost entirely driven by the Star Wars franchise. Transition George Lucas launched Lucasfilm in 1971 and the first Star Wars film was released in 1977. \"For the past 35 years, one of my greatest pleasures has been to see Star Wars passed from one generation to the next,\" Mr Lucas said. \"I've always believed that Star Wars could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime.\" Mr Lucas will continue as a creative consultant. Kathleen Kennedy, currently co-chairman of Lucasfilm, will become president of the firm and will be the executive producer on the new Star Wars films. She worked on the Jurassic Park and Back to the Future franchises and co-founded Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg. When the later Star Wars films were released in the 1990s and 2000s, although they did well at the box office, they were generally not well-received by fans. But Josh Dickey, film editor at Variety magazine in LA, said that Disney was a \"great fit\" to update Star Wars. \"They're so good at branding and brands. They're so good at working with existing intellectual property and making it resonate with fans and marketing it very well,\" he told BBC World Service radio. \"They're not as good at creating original content, except for their Pixar division. \"I think if you bring together the minds from Pixar [and] the minds from Disney, the news that Disney is going to reboot Star Wars was a lot more exciting to fans than just 'there's gonna be another Star Wars'.\" Surprise Lucasfilm is also the production company behind the Indiana Jones franchise, and fantasy films Willow and Labyrinth. Michael Corty, analyst at Morning Star, said Disney's deal was clearly part of a pattern in buying new franchises. \"Pixar was the first big one, then Marvel, and now this one here,\" he said. \"Because Lucas is private, I would assume most investors would be surprised.\"",

    "text": "Two of the men were among the kingdom's most influential figures. The detentions are seen as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightening his grip on power. In 2017 dozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen were confined to Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel after the crown prince ordered their arrests. Mohammed bin Salman, a controversial figure, has been considered the de facto ruler of the kingdom after he was named crown prince by his father in 2016. The detentions were first revealed by the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which said they took place early on Friday. The three men arrested are the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and a royal cousin, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef. Mohammed bin Nayef was interior minister until he was removed from his role and placed under house arrest by Mohammed Bin Salman in 2017. In his previous role, he was seen as a close and trusted partner by US intelligence officials. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 78, is the king's only surviving full brother. In 2018 he made comments seen as critical of the crown prince to protesters in London but later said he had been misinterpreted. Both men were seen as potential rivals to the 34-year-old crown prince, who is first in line for the throne. Guards arrived at the homes of the royals wearing masks and dressed in black, and searched the properties, the Wall Street Journal says. This is a significant move by Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate his position. Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz is one of the last surviving sons of the country's founder, King Abdelaziz, and widely respected amongst older members of the ruling family. The other senior prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was next in line to the throne before he was suddenly replaced three years ago. Before that, as interior minister, he was credited with defeating the al-Qaeda insurgency that gripped Saudi Arabia in the 2000s. There has been no immediate official confirmation or denial of the story published in the US media but palace affairs in Saudi Arabia are often shrouded in secrecy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman won international praise in 2016 when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018. He has also been criticised over the continuing conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia backs pro-government forces, and the harsh treatment of women's rights activists. despite the lifting of some restrictions including the right to drive.

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The mutations that lead to lung cancer had been considered to be permanent, and to persist even after quitting. But the surprise findings, published in Nature, show the few cells that escape damage can repair the lungs. The effect has been seen even in patients who had smoked a pack a day for 40 years before giving up. The thousands of chemicals in tobacco smoke corrupt and mutate the DNA in your lung cells - slowly transforming them from healthy to cancerous. The study uncovered that happening on a massive scale in a smoker's lungs even before they had cancer. The overwhelming majority of cells taken from a smoker's airways had been mutated by tobacco, with cells containing up to 10,000 genetic alterations. \"These can be thought of as mini time bombs, waiting for the next hit that causes them to progress to cancer,\" said Dr Kate Gowers, one of the researchers at UCL. But a small proportion of cells went unscathed. Exactly how they avoid the genetic devastation caused by smoking is unclear, but the researchers said they appeared to \"exist in a nuclear bunker\". However, after someone quits smoking, it is these cells that grow and replace the damaged cells in the lungs. In people who quit, up to 40% of their cells looked just like those from people who had never smoked. \"We were totally unprepared for the finding,\" Dr Peter Campbell, from the Sanger Institute, told BBC News. He added: \"There is a population of cells that, kind of, magically replenish the lining of the airways. \"One of the remarkable things was patients who had quit, even after 40 years of smoking, had regeneration of cells that were totally unscathed by the exposure to tobacco.\" Motivation to quit The researchers still need to assess how much of the lungs are repaired. The study focused on the major airways rather than the small structures called alveoli, where oxygen crosses from the air we breathe into our lungs. There are about 47,000 cases of lung cancer in the UK each year. Nearly three-quarters of them are caused by smoking. Studies have already shown that people cut their risk of lung cancer almost from the day they quit. The assumption had been that this was simply because any further mutations caused by smoking were avoided. Dr Rachel Orritt, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"It's a really motivating idea that people who stop smoking might reap the benefits twice over - by preventing more tobacco-related damage to lung cells, and by giving their lungs the chance to balance out some of the existing damage with healthier cells.\" Follow James on Twitter.",

    "text": "Almost half of cases of womb cancer in the UK - about 3,700 a year - could be prevented through keeping slim and active, a review of data shows. Researchers at Imperial College, London, say women can reduce their risk with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise and keeping a healthy weight. The World Cancer Research Fund report also found that coffee may reduce risk. But experts say there is not yet enough evidence to recommend drinking coffee to protect against the disease. Endometrial cancer - cancer of the womb lining - is the fourth most common of all cancers in women in the UK. In the first global analysis since 2007, Imperial College London researchers collated and reviewed scientific research on endometrial cancer, and links with diet, physical activity and body weight. The study found evidence that about 3,700 cases could be prevented every year if women were active for 38 minutes a day and maintained a healthy body weight. In the UK only 56% of women follow recommendations to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week, while only 39% have a healthy weight. Study author Dr Teresa Norat of Imperial College told the BBC: \"If you are physically active and if you don't have excess body weight you can reduce your risk of womb cancer and improve your health in general.\" Karen Sadler, executive director of the World Cancer Research Fund added: \"The evidence on coffee is very interesting and is a further indication of the potential link between coffee and the risk of cancer but a lot more work still needs to be done. \"We need to consider the possible effect on other cancers as well as the impact on other health conditions and we are now looking to conduct further research into this issue.\"",

    "text": "The 37-year-old mother of six has explained her reasons for having the surgery in the New York Times. She said her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. \"I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could,\" she wrote. Her partner, Brad Pitt, praised her choice as \"absolutely heroic\". Risk reduced Ms Jolie said the process began in February and was completed by the end of April. In an article entitled My Medical Choice, she explained that her mother fought cancer for nearly a decade and died at the age of 56. She said she had sought to reassure her children that the same illness would not take her away from them, \"but the truth is I carry a 'faulty' gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer\". She said that once she \"knew that this was my reality\", she had taken the decision to undergo the nine weeks of complex surgery required to have a double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction of the breasts with implants. \"There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful,\" she wrote. Her chances of developing breast cancer have now dropped from 87% to under 5%, she said. She praised her partner, actor Brad Pitt, for his love and support throughout the procedure, and said she was reassured that her children had found nothing in the results \"that makes them uncomfortable\". \"I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,\" she said. \"For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options,\" Ms Jolie went on to say. \"I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.\" In an interview with the Evening Standard, Brad Pitt said: \"Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find Angie's choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. \"All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family.\" Ms Jolie, an award-winning actress and director, is also a long-time supporter of humanitarian causes. She is currently a special envoy for the UN Refugee Agency. During the period she was undergoing the double mastectomy procedure, Ms Jolie visited the Democratic Republic of Congo with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and attended the G8 summit of foreign ministers in London to raise awareness over sexual violence in conflict. She also helped launch a charity to fund girls' education set up by the Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai, who survived being shot by the Taliban last October. Ms Jolie has three biological children and three adopted children. Risk factor Emma Parlons, a 38-year-old mother from London who had the operation three years ago, welcomed her decision to raise awareness of the issue. Ms Parlons said her risk of getting breast cancer was the same as the actress's. \"If somebody said your flight across the Atlantic was 86% likely to come down, you wouldn't get on that plane would you?\" she said in an explanation of her reasons for having the operation. Professor Gareth Evans, of the Manchester Breast Centre in Britain, said the two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer one and two) \"were the first two majorly breast cancer pre-disposing genes that were identified\" and are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \"The risk associated with the genes isn't simply an exact figure like 87%,\" he told the BBC. \"It does depend on other risk factors, and so the risk for someone with a BRCA1 mutation could vary anywhere between 50 and 95% for breast cancer.\" Currently, women facing a strong likelihood of developing breast cancer have only two real options - to have both of their breasts removed (a double mastectomy) or hope that it will never actually happen. In January, the drugs watchdog in England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommended women at a high genetic risk of breast cancer should be given the option of taking the drug Tamoxifen, or another one called raloxifene, for five years to cut their lifetime risk of the disease.",

    "text": "The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris. Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014. Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. 'Role model' for millions The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\" Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. \"Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim,\" he says. Bus drivers 'new elite'? Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds. \"Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians\" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith. In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says \"two images of the United Kingdom\" faced each other in this election: The \"exemplary success story\" of Mr Khan's life and \"the billionaire's son\", Mr Goldsmith. \"In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility,\" she told the paper. \"It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side.\" Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.",

    "text": "Horst Seehofer has long been a vocal critic of Mrs Merkel's refugee policies but has now taken up a key role at the heart of her new coalition. His comments are seen as an effort to win back voters from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The chancellor was quick to distance herself from the remarks. In his interview with the mass-circulation Bild newspaper, Mr Seehofer said Germany had been \"shaped by Christianity\", and that the country should not give up its own traditions. \"No. Islam does not belong to Germany. Germany is shaped by Christianity,\" he said. \"The Muslims who live among us naturally belong to Germany... That of course does not mean that we should, out of a false consideration for others, give up our traditions and customs. \"Muslims need to live with us, not next to us or against us.\" Mr Seehofer, who heads Mrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party the CSU, also vowed to increase deportations of rejected asylum-seekers. The chancellor made plain in 2015, amid a rise in anti-immigration protests, that she believed Islam was part of Germany, echoing the words of former president Christian Wulff. On Friday she emphasised the need for coexistence between religions. \"Our country is heavily influenced by Christianity - and a Jewish influence - but in the meantime four million Muslims are living in Germany and they also practise their religion here and these Muslims also belong to Germany and so their religion, Islam, also belongs to Germany,\" she said. Divisions exposed Analysis by Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Horst Seehofer has fashioned himself for a unique role in German politics - that of thorn in Angela Merkel's side. As leader of the CSU he was a frequent and vociferous critic of the chancellor, particularly over her asylum policy. He may now be in her cabinet - a controversial appointment made in return for CSU support for the hard-won coalition with the SPD - but Mr Seehofer is still up for a fight, directly opposing the chancellor, who has publicly stated that Islam does belong to Germany. This is, in part, about chasing the far-right AfD. Mr Seehofer has an eye on his beloved Bavaria - there are regional elections there later this year and the AfD has made gains in the state. But his comments, which come just days after several attacks on Muslim institutions, have outraged many and represent a bad start for Mrs Merkel's new government. Mr Seehofer has highlighted divisions within her coalition and he risks playing right into the hands of the AfD, the largest opposition party, who would like nothing better than to establish immigration as the central theme of this parliament. More than one million migrants arrived in Germany after Mrs Merkel opened the doors to Syrian asylum seekers in 2015. The backlash sparked by her policy helped fuel the country's far right in last year's election - the AfD entered the federal parliament for the first time - and led to the worst electoral performance in almost 70 years for her CDU party. After Germany's longest post-war period of coalition-building, Mrs Merkel was sworn in for a fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday. Under the coalition deal, the CDU-CSU conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to limit migration.",

    "text": "The British Geological Survey estimates there may be 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas present in the north of England - double previous estimates. Meanwhile the government has announced measures to enable shale gas drilling as part of its infrastructure plans. Energy Minister Michael Fallon described shale gas as \"an exciting new energy resource\". The BGS said its estimate for shale gas resources in the Bowland Basin region, which stretches from Cheshire to Yorkshire, represented potential resources, but \"not the gas that might be possible to extract\". \"Shale gas clearly has potential in Britain but it will require geological and engineering expertise, investment and protection of the environment,\" it said. Drilling companies have previously estimated that they may be able to extract around 10% of this gas - equivalent to around 130 trillion cubic feet. 'Early days' If the estimates are proved correct, that would still suggest recoverable reserves of shale gas far in excess of the three trillion cubic feet of gas currently consumed in the UK each year. Shale gas is extracted through \"fracking\" - the controversial process of freeing trapped gas by pumping in a mixture of water, sand and chemicals. The process has helped boost the domestic energy industry in the US in recent years, where oil production has risen and gas prices have plummeted. In a statement, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"Though it is early days for shale in the UK, it has the potential to contribute to the UK's energy security, increase inward investment and growth.\" The government has unveiled a package of reforms to encourage development in the industry. They include new planning guidelines to make the process of approving new drilling sites more streamlined, and a consultation on tax incentives to encourage exploration. Communities affected by shale gas drilling are also expected to receive £100,000 in \"community benefits\" and 1% of production revenues, should sites start producing gas. \"Shale gas represents an exciting new potential energy resource for the UK, and could play an important part in our energy mix,\" said Energy Minister Michael Fallon \"Development must be done in partnership with local people. We welcome the commitments from industry on community benefits. \"This will provide a welcome boost for communities who will host shale exploration and production as well as offering strong assurances that operators will engage with them and work to the highest health, safety and environmental standards.\" He said communities hosting shale gas drilling could benefit from cheaper bills, regeneration schemes and new community facilities like playgrounds and sports halls. The incentives are designed to overcome significant scepticism surrounding the process of fracking, which has generated environmental concerns. Critics argue that it can cause earth tremors and pollute water supplies, and that shale gas wells could blight the countryside and affect house prices. They also want investment in green energy sources, rather than fossil fuels. Labour's shadow energy minister, Tom Greatrex, conceded that gas would remain \"an important part of our energy mix in the future\". But he dismissed the announcement of incentives as \"a desperate attempt to draw attention away from the government's cuts to infrastructure investment... and its abject failure to get the economy growing\". Power warning Currently the UK's shale industry remains in its infancy, with relatively small energy companies such as IGas and Cuadrilla until recently the only firms with licences to explore share gas resources. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, announced its intention to buy a stake in one licence in the Bowland Basin owned by Cuadrilla earlier this month. The report for the government comes as energy regulator Ofgem warned that the risks of power blackouts has increased because excess capacity in the power industry has fallen in the UK. The watchdog has twice warned in recent months that the amount of spare power is shrinking, partly due to some gas generators being taken out of service. Centrica has already withdrawn two of its gas plants from operation. In April, SSE confirmed that it too would mothball gas plants and put off investments in new ones. Adam Scorer, of the lobby group Consumer Futures, said: \"Projections of ever-tighter capacity margins understandably raise fears of higher electricity prices. \"Government and regulator need to agree on the most realistic capacity scenarios, the least-cost ways of reducing demand and, where necessary, of incentivising new generation capacity.\" Announcing further details of the government's spending review to parliament, Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said the government had agreed \"strike prices\" in an effort to boost investment in renewable forms of energy. The prices mean the government will guarantee to pay a certain price for energy generated through on-shore and off-shore wind, tidal, wave, bio-mass and solar power.",

    "text": "The 54-year-old actress, known simply as Sridevi, drowned in her hotel apartment's bathtub following loss of consciousness, it says. It had earlier been reported that she died of cardiac arrest on Saturday while at a family wedding in Dubai. Bollywood stars, sporting giants and leading politicians have reacted with shock to her death. The media arm of the Dubai government said the post-mortem analysis had been completed and the cause of death ascertained. The case has been passed to the Dubai Public Prosecution for what officials said were \"regular legal procedures\". The post-mortem report has been released by Dubai police to Sridevi's family and the Indian consulate, the Gulf News says. The paper said the report could mean a delay to the repatriation of the body. It had been expected to be flown home on Monday. Crowds have gathered outside Sridevi's home in Mumbai to pay their last respects ahead of a cremation. The Dubai government tweet did not reveal the results of any toxicology tests. The full post-mortem report has not yet been made public and will be expected to explain how the original report of cardiac arrest and the listing of \"accidental drowning\" are linked. The actress had been in the United Arab Emirates to attend the wedding of her nephew, Mohit Marwah. Few details had been given about the case prior to Monday's release of the cause of death. What has the reaction been to Sridevi's death? Why was she such a huge box-office draw? The star of such classics as Mr India, Chandni, ChaalBaaz and Sadma, Sridevi worked in the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi languages. Her acting career began at the age of four and by 13 she was cast in the adult role of a woman avenging her lover's death. Sridevi debuted as a lead actress in a Bollywood film in 1978, soon becoming one of India's biggest film stars. She was considered one of the very few Indian female superstars capable of huge box-office success without the support of a male hero. The actress decided to take a break from the film industry after the release of Judaai in 1997. She made a comeback in 2012, starring in English Vinglish. In 2013, the Indian government awarded her the Padma Shri - the country's fourth-highest civilian honour.

The prosecution levelled 16 charges against Mr Nizami including genocide, rape, murder, arson and looting. His trial is set to begin on 1 July. All of the people currently indicted by the tribunal deny the charges and opposition leaders accuse the government of carrying out a political vendetta.

    "text": "By Stephen EvansSeoul Correspondent, BBC News When outsiders are arrested, they are often sentenced to hard labour, and that's exactly what it is - compounded by the severe oppression of isolation and helplessness. The BBC knows of one former prisoner who was broken psychologically by his treatment. Many years later, he remains too traumatised to talk about it easily. But others have described their experience in detail. In December 2012, North Korea charged missionary Kenneth Bae with acts \"hostile to the republic\". He had visited the country many times, but was stopped on this occasion and a hard drive with Christian material was discovered. For this \"crime\", he was sentenced to 15 years hard labour, and only released when his health deteriorated seriously - just as seems to have happened in the current case of Otto Warmbier. After his release, Mr Bae wrote a memoir, \"Not Forgotten: The True Story of My Imprisonment in North Korea\" in which he said that he was interrogated from 08:00 in the morning until 22:00 or 23:00 at night every day for the first four weeks of his imprisonment. Under this pressure, he wrote the hundreds of pages of confessions his interrogators demanded. Mr Bae said he would work six days a week on a farm, \"carrying rock, shovelling coal\". His daily routine was to wake at 06:00, eat breakfast, pray, and then be taken to perform the hard labour from 08:00 until 18:00. Under this regime, he lost a lot of weight - an estimated 60lbs (27kg) in the 735 days of his captivity. As his weight dropped, his health increasingly failed and he was repeatedly taken for medical treatment. Apart from the physical toll, there was a psychological pain, a feeling of isolation. He said one interrogator kept telling him: \"No-one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home\". He said: \"I felt like an insect, tangled in the spider web. Every time I moved it got messier, with no way out.\" He does say that, later on, after the month of interrogation was over, he was allowed to see emails and messages from people back home (though this may have been both a comfort and a torment). He seems to have been allowed a bible. When he became seriously ill, it looks as though the North Korean authorities became concerned that he might die, with all the diplomatic difficulty that would cause. And so they arranged his release - as it appears might have happened in the case of Otto Warmbier. Dig their own graves Kenneth Bae is an American citizen originally from South Korea, and so spoke Korean. He said he thought his treatment as a prisoner with a cell of his own, including a bed and a toilet, was not as tough as that for North Koreans held in the vast array of camps for ordinary crime or for dissent. He may be right on this. Amnesty International has described the prison camps as harsh beyond endurance. \"Hundreds of thousands of people - including children - are detained in political prison camps and other detention facilities in North Korea,\" it says. \"Many of those have not committed any crime, but are merely family members of those deemed guilty of serious political crimes\". Amnesty analyses aerial pictures of the camps and says that one of them is three times the size of Washington DC contains 20,000 inmates. According to one former official it had talked to, detainees were forced to dig their own graves and rape was used as punishment, the victims then disappearing. Kenneth Bae does not say he was physically tortured or beaten. His decline in health was because the harshness of the prison regime exacerbated his diabetes, high blood pressure and a kidney condition. That may or may not be the case of Otto Warmbier. But there are questions which the authorities in the United States are surely asking: How did he end up in a coma? And why did North Korea take a year to tell any outside country? If it was because of some sort of physical attack, there might be political pressure on President Donald Trump to get tougher with the regime in Pyongyang. There is one other intriguing question: do prisoners influence their jailers? Stockholm Syndrome is when a hostage comes to identify with the people holding him or her, but is there a reverse Stockholm Syndrome? Kenneth Bae found that his captors were curious about life in the West. They wanted to know how much a house cost, and whether many people really did own their own home and car. \"At the beginning, it was difficult but because I speak the language I was able to communicate,\" he said later, after he was freed. North Koreans had been told of a grim life in America where 99% of people lived in poverty. \"I told them most people own a house and a car, and they said: 'That can't be right'.\"",

    "text": "The two sides had discussed holding talks to resolve the Qatar crisis, which has seen Doha cut off from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. However, Saudi Arabia then accused Qatar of distorting facts about the call, and said it was ending talks. The four countries say Qatar supports terrorism - something Doha denies. The row led to all four Arab nations cutting ties with Qatar on 5 June - Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, while all four countries cut air and sea links with the country. Friday's phone call, which came after US President Donald Trump spoke separately with both sides, had initially been seen as a possible breakthrough in the crisis. The call was the first formal contact between Riyadh and Doha since the crisis began. State media on both sides reported that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had discussed the need for dialogue to resolve the crisis. Who said what? The Saudi Press Agency said Qatar's leader had \"expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries\", and that further details would be announced after Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. Meanwhile, the Qatar News Agency said the Saudi crown prince had proposed assigning \"two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of states\". Shortly afterwards, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of not being \"serious\" about dialogue, and said communications between the two sides would be suspended. The row appears to be over protocol - observers say Saudi Arabia is angered that Qatari state media did not make clear that the call was initiated by Doha. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, who are blockading Qatar, have presented a list of conditions for the lifting of sanctions. They include the closure of news broadcaster Al-Jazeera and reducing ties with Iran. The group accuses the Qatari-funded channel of fostering extremism, a charge the network denies. Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait and backed by Western powers have so far failed to end the dispute. On Friday, Mr Trump spoke with both sides, and the UAE, in an attempt to broker talks. \"The president underscored that unity among the United States' Arab partners is essential to promoting regional stability and countering the threat of Iran,\" the White House said in a statement. It added that \"all countries must follow through on commitments... to defeat terrorism, cut off funding for terrorist groups and combat extremist ideology\".",

    "text": "The FSB says they are members of ultra-nationalist movements and were preparing attacks inside Russia. Ukraine's Security Service says Russian media reports that it had ordered any such attacks were \"nonsense\". Tensions are high after Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Nato says Russia has tens of thousands of troops massed along its border with eastern Ukraine. The BBC's Steven Rosenberg in Moscow says those detained by the FSB reportedly include three members of the Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector. The Ukrainians have been accused of taking photographs of Russian troop movements and of trying to make contact with extremist elements in Russia. In a statement, the FSB said those being held had been planning attacks between 14-17 March in Russia's Rostov, Volgograd, Tver, Orel, Belgorod, Kalmykia and Tatarstan regions. Earlier, government officials in Kiev levelled their own accusations against Moscow, claiming that more than 30 FSB agents had been involved in planning operations against anti-government protesters in Kiev earlier this year. Ukrainian Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaychenko also said the FSB had sent \"tonnes\" of explosives and weapons by plane to Ukraine. More than 100 protesters were killed in unrest that started last November when then President Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an association deal with the EU in favour of closer ties with Russia. Months of street protests ended when Mr Yanukovych fled Kiev in February and opposition leaders formed an interim government. Ukraine's new authorities have since signed the political part of the association agreement with the EU. Also on Thursday, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said an inquiry had shown that special police had been behind the killings of anti-government protesters in Kiev in February. He said 12 members of the Berkut police had been identified as snipers and arrested. He presented what he said was new evidence from the shootings on 18-20 February, when 76 people were killed. 'Same gun' Mr Avakov said the inquiry had established that in one episode, eight of those killed were hit by bullets from the same gun. Most of the demonstrators who died were killed on Instytutska Street near the main protest camp on Independence Square, widely known as the Maidan. Shortly after Mr Yanukovych's downfall, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula following a referendum that Kiev and the West have called illegal. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the BBC that it was \"crystal clear\" that President Yanukovych and his allies were responsible for the killings of protesters - a claim denied by Mr Yanukovych who is now in Russia. In other developments on Thursday, Moscow raised the price of its gas for Ukraine to $485 (£292) per 1,000 cubic metres - the second hike in two days. The European Parliament also backed a proposal to cut customs duties on imports from Ukraine - a measure that is expected to save Ukrainian firms 487m euros (£404m) per year.",

    "text": "Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party. The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate. It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions. Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers. The decision to allow families to have two children was designed \"to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday. Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion. The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child. China's one-child policy What was China's one-child policy? Trauma and sympathy shared online Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm. Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports. And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds. \"As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,\" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP. I lost two siblings - by Juliana Liu, BBC News Hong Kong correspondent I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born. In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year. But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky. As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

The announcement in China came on the final day of a summit of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, known as the fifth plenum. The party also announced growth targets and its next five year plan.",

Live streaming via mobile phones has become one of the big technology trends of the year, with Twitter-owned Periscope and Meerkat proving popular. Last year, Amazon paid $1bn for live streaming game site Twitch. Initially Facebook's live video feature will be available only to a small percentage of people in the US and will be limited to iPhones. The tech giant said that \"over time, the company plans to bring it to all users\" but it did not give specific timescales. In a blogpost introducing the service, Facebook said: \"Live lets you show the people you care about what you're seeing in real time - whether visiting a new place, cooking your favourite recipe or just want to share some thoughts.\" The stream will display the number of live viewers, the names of friends who are watching and real-time comments as they are written. The video will be saved to users' timelines until they choose to delete them. Nation of sharers Facebook has also updated the way people can share photo collages - allowing users to mix photos and videos. Ian Maude, an analyst with research firm Enders said of the streaming service: \"Facebook has a vast audience to promote services to so there is nothing stopping it from becoming a significant player in video streaming.\" He said that Britain, like many other countries, had become \"a nation of sharers\". \"We like to tell what what we are doing all the time.\" Privacy advocates have raised concerns about such services but Mr Maude believes that Facebook will be keen to avoid any controversy. \"They will be cognisant of the privacy concerns and I believe there are restrictions on how the content can be shared, so that it won't be automatically broadcast to everyone.\"",

The work - known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) - was sold in New York for a record $450m (£341m). It was the highest auction price for any work of art. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. The New York Times reported that it was bought by Saudi prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, citing documents the newspaper had reviewed. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. The Louvre Abu Dhabi museum opened earlier this month in the United Arab Emirates. It cost £1bn to build the museum over the past 10 years. It holds 600 artworks permanently and 300 loaned from France. The museum pays Paris hundreds of millions of dollars for this as well as for the use of the Louvre name and managerial advice.",

    "text": "By Samiha NettikkaraBBC News It has rolled out an ambitious project to extend regional air networks to connect underserved destinations to the major cities. The ruling BJP says its efforts have shown results, declaring that the number of airports operating in India has increased significantly. In the run-up to the Indian election, which gets under way on 11 April, BBC Reality Check is examining claims and pledges made by the main political parties. Claim: The ruling BJP party says it has increased the number of operational airports in India from 65 in 2014 to 102 by this year. It also claims that in 2017, more than 100 million passengers flew on domestic routes - and for the first time, more people travelled by air than in air-conditioned train compartments. Verdict: The data - from both government and aviation authorities - does point to more airports since 2014. But the exact number differs according to which source you use. The claims about air passenger numbers are true. How many airports? In February, the ruling BJP referred to 102 operational airports in a social media posting - saying this was up from 65 in 2014, when it came to power. There are several sources for official data - but they do not match. The Airports Authority of India, which is responsible for civil infrastructure, identifies 68 operational airports in 2013-14. By March 2018, it reported that there were 129 airports - but did not say how many were operational. A government statement in parliament in July 2018 said 101 were operational. India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - the body that regulates civil aviation - has the following figures: Its website does not have airport numbers for 2014. It is worth adding that the Congress party-led government - in power from 2009 to 2014 - told parliament that as many as 90 airports were operational by February 2014, a higher figure than that given by the BJP. And the annual report of the Ministry of Civil Aviation for the same year mentions 94 operational airports. So if you take these figures, the increase in new airports under the BJP looks less dramatic. Read more from Reality Check How many passengers? What about the BJP claim that more than 100 million passengers flew on domestic routes in 2017, and in that year more people travelled by air than in air-conditioned train compartments? A statement in parliament last year said that the total number of passengers on scheduled domestic routes was 103.75 million for the fiscal year 2016-17. And the DGCA figures show that there were already nearly 100 million passengers carried on domestic routes during the calendar year of 2016. So did more passengers travel by air than by the most expensive class of rail travel in 2017 - air conditioned (AC) coach? According to the annual report of Indian railways in 2016-17, the number of AC coach passengers that year was about 145.5 million. The DGCA says there were a total of 158.43 million passengers on both domestic and international air routes in India in 2017, surpassing those using AC train carriages. Stiff competition between domestic airlines in recent years has pushed down the cost of flights to a level now comparable with AC rail travel, and of course it's much faster. However, many more millions continue to use cheaper forms of rail travel.",

    "text": "But officials say it will be some time before the summary is made public. Leaked parts of the report said that the CIA often misled the government over its interrogation methods when George W Bush was president. The CIA disputes some of the findings, saying the report contains errors. Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said that it had voted 11-3 to declassify what she called the \"shocking\" results of the investigation. \"The report exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation. It chronicles a stain on our history that must never be allowed to happen again. This is not what Americans do,\" the California Democrat said. Correspondents say that while some of the committee's Republicans voted with the Democrats in favour of declassifying the report, it was clear there were bitter divides within the panel. Georgia Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss said that while he voted for the report's declassification \"to get it behind us\", it was still \"a waste of time\". A statement released by Ms Feinstein said that the report highlighted \"major problems\" with the CIA's management of its secret Detention and Interrogation Programme, which involved more than 100 detainees. \"This is also deeply troubling and shows why oversight of intelligence agencies in a democratic nation is so important,\" the statement said. \"The release of this summary and conclusions in the near future shows that this nation admits its errors, as painful as they may be, and seeks to learn from them. \"It is now abundantly clear that, in an effort to prevent further terrorist attacks after 9/11 and bring those responsible to justice, the CIA made serious mistakes that haunt us to this day.\" The statement said that the full 6,200-page report - which took five years to compile - has been updated and will be declassified at a later time. It said that the executive summary, findings and conclusions - which total more than 500 pages - will be sent to President Barack Obama for declassification review and subsequent public release. Leaks of the report in the Washington Post on Tuesday said that the CIA used secret \"black sites\" to interrogate prisoners using techniques not previously acknowledged. These included dunking suspects in icy water and smashing a prisoner's head against a wall. Officials said that the CIA's interrogation programme yielded little useful intelligence and was not helpful in the hunt for al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden or anything else of value.",

    "text": "By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi Mumbai businessman Raphael Samuel told the BBC that it's wrong to bring children into the world because they then have to put up with lifelong suffering. Mr Samuel, of course, understands that our consent can't be sought before we are born, but insists that \"it was not our decision to be born\". So as we didn't ask to be born, we should be paid for the rest of our lives to live, he argues. A demand like this could cause a rift within any family, but Mr Samuel says he gets along very well with his parents (both of whom are lawyers) and they appear to be dealing with it with a lot of humour. In a statement, his mother Kavita Karnad Samuel explained her response to \"the recent upheaval my son has created\". \"I must admire my son's temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers. And if Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault,\" she said. Mr Samuel's belief is rooted in what's called anti-natalism - a philosophy that argues that life is so full of misery that people should stop procreating immediately. This, he says, would gradually phase out humanity from the Earth and that would also be so much better for the planet. \"There's no point to humanity. So many people are suffering. If humanity is extinct, Earth and animals would be happier. They'll certainly be better off. Also no human will then suffer. Human existence is totally pointless.\" A year ago, he created a Facebook page, Nihilanand, which features posters that show his images with a huge fake beard, an eye-mask and anti-natalist messages like \"Isn't forcing a child into this world and forcing it to have a career, kidnapping, and slavery?\" Or, \"Your parents had you instead of a toy or a dog, you owe them nothing, you are their entertainment.\" You might also be interested in: Mr Samuel says he remembers first having anti-natalist thoughts when he was five. \"I was a normal kid. One day I was very frustrated and I didn't want to go to school but my parents kept asking me to go. So I asked them: 'Why did you have me?' And my dad had no answer. I think if he'd been able to answer, maybe I wouldn't have thought this way.\" As the idea grew and took shape in his mind, he decided to tell his parents about it. He says his mum reacted \"very well\" and dad too \"is warming up\" to the idea. \"Mum said she wished she had met me before I was born and that if she did, she definitely wouldn't have had me,\" he says laughing and adds that she does see reason in his argument. \"She told me that she was quite young when she had me and that she didn't know she had another option. But that's what I'm trying to say - everyone has the option.\" In her statement, his mother also said it was unfair to focus on a \"sliver of what he believes in\". \"His belief in anti-natalism, his concern for the burden on Earth's resources due to needless life, his sensitivity toward the pain experienced unwittingly by children while growing up and so much more has been ruefully forgotten. \"I'm very happy that my son has grown up into a fearless, independent-thinking young man. He is sure to find his path to happiness.\" Mr Samuel says his decision to take his parents to court is only based on his belief that the world would be a much better place without human beings in it. So six months ago, one day at breakfast, he told his mother that he was planning to sue her. \"She said that's fine, but don't expect me to go easy on you. I will destroy you in court.\" Mr Samuel is now looking for a lawyer to take up his case, but so far he's not had much success. \"I know it's going to be thrown out because no judge would hear it. But I do want to file a case because I want to make a point.\" His Facebook posts have also attracted a lot of responses, \"some positive, but mostly negative\" with some even advising him to \"go kill yourself\". He has also had worried mums asking him what would happen if their children see his posts. \"Some argue logically, some are offended and some are offensive. To those abusing me, let them abuse me. But I also hear from many who say they support me but can't say this publicly for whatever reasons. I ask them to come out and speak up,\" he says. His critics also say that he's doing this to get some publicity. \"I'm not really doing this for publicity,\" he says, \"but I do want the idea to go public. This simple idea that it's okay to not have a child.\" I ask him if he is unhappy being born. \"I wish I was not born. But it's not that I'm unhappy in my life. My life is good, but I'd rather not be here. You know it's like there's a nice room, but I don't want to be in that room,\" he explains.",

He is accused of making a recent threat to kill Mr Roy on social media. Avijit Roy, a US citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was hacked to death by men with machetes last Thursday while visiting Bangladesh. His wife was badly wounded. Colonel Ziaul Ahsan, from Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), told local media bdnews24.com that Mr Farabi was leaving the city when he was arrested in Dhaka's Jatrabarhi area on Monday morning. RAB spokesman Major Maksudul Alam said he was \"the main suspect\" in the attack on Avijit Roy, who was a critic of religious intolerance. Mr Roy's family said he had been threatened by Mr Farabi on Twitter and Facebook, Maj Alam said. \"[Roy's] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times,\" he told AFP news agency. Police accuse Mr Farabi of involvement with the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Bangladesh. On Sunday, the Bangladeshi government accepted a US offer of FBI help to assist in the murder inquiry. Wife in hospital Avijit Roy was attacked last Thursday evening by men wielding machetes as he returned from a book fair in Dhaka, his native city. His wife Rafida Ahmed also suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack and remains in hospital in a serious condition.

Ahmed Rajib Haider was among a group of bloggers who had called for the execution of Islamist leaders for crimes committed in Bangladesh's 1971 independence war.
