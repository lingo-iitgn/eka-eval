They found even small modifications could yield huge gains when combining healthier options into daily meals; they recommend cutting down on processed meats including sausages, ham, salami and hot dogs while increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, plant-based proteins and unsaturated fats. It suggests swapping animal products for alternatives rich in vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients may help prevent disease linked to malnutrition worldwide. This plan aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking around five billion cars off the road annually.
