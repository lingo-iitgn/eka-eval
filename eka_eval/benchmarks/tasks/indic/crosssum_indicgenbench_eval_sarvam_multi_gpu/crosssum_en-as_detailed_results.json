In what amounted to a case study on technology’s role in modern crime, authorities recovered about sixty bodies from different locations across the country since July 2017 — including many chopped into pieces or decapitated. During sentencing, juror judge Nao Kuninji told defendant Shiraiiski (as per BBC News) ”I will not have mercy; you are going down.” This sentence comes three years after accusations against him surfaced nationwide which eventually led to arrest. Over half a million viewers watched the hearing live during its opening hours – but no fewer than twenty percent showed interest again just thirty minutes prior.
