He added there would need further evidence before doctors advise parents to feed baby chickens regularly. Around one quarter of all British preschoolers appear deficient in Vitamin D according to government figures published last year; mainly due to lack of sunlight exposure. Professor Ostry believes regular consumption can cut down risk without posing risks associated with excessive intake via supplements. In the latest report he led tests involving mothers receiving either no extra vitamins while pregnant and breastfeeding nor supplementation later onwards, alongside those given weekly capsules filled with pure protein extract derived from fish livers rich in Vitamin D.
