    "text": "The country's most wanted fugitive, he was detained north of Paris, reportedly with his brother and two men. Faïd, 46, is a fan of gangster films, which he credits with teaching him how to pull off raids. He was first arrested in 1998 for armed robbery. The 1 July jailbreak was his second and most dramatic escape. He was sprung from a prison in Réau, south-east of Paris, by three heavily armed men who broke into the visitors' room. They then bundled him into a helicopter flown by a flying instructor who had been taken hostage. Faïd had been serving a 25-year sentence for masterminding a botched robbery in which a policewoman was killed in 2010. He was recaptured in the early hours of Wednesday in the town of Creil. French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Europe 1 radio: \"We're going to put him in a high-security facility where he will be watched extremely closely.\" The arrest came hours after Interior Minister Gérard Collomb - the country's top law-enforcement official - resigned to run for mayor in Lyon, France's second-largest city. The move is regarded as a fresh setback for President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The interior ministry will be temporarily headed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe. Who is Rédoine Faïd? Born in 1972, he grew up in Creil. In the 1990s he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion. He has said Hollywood movies, such as the Al Pacino thriller Scarface, inspired his lifestyle and some of his schemes. During a 1997 attack on a security van, he used and his accomplices used ice-hockey goalkeeper masks, mimicking Robert de Niro's gang in the film Heat. He later said he had watched that movie \"hundreds of times\" on DVD and once told its director, Michael Mann, at a Paris film festival: \"You were my technical adviser.\" His fame was helped by a 2009 book outlining his younger days on the streets of Paris and his descent into the life of a professional criminal. That earned him the nickname \"L'Écrivain\" - or \"the writer\" - among French police. Timeline of a jailbreaker",

Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. \"We hope to have the UK as a close partner of the EU also in the future.\" Brexit: What happens next? Francois Hollande, French President \"This is a painful choice and it is deeply regrettable both for the UK and Europe. But this choice is theirs and we must respect it, accepting all the consequences. \"The British vote is a tough test for Europe.\" Full statement (in French) Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany \"We take note of the British people's decision with regret. There is no doubt that this is a blow to Europe and to the European unification process.\" Mrs Merkel said that because of its history, Germany has \"a particular interest and a particular responsibility\" to make European unity a success. Barack Obama, US President \"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security, and economic policy. \"So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond. \"The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.\" Full statement Geert Wilders, Dutch Freedom Party leader The UK vote to leave the European Union comes amid rising Euroscepticism in Europe. Some in the EU fear the result could reverse 70 years of European integration. Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom (PVV) opposes immigration, told the BBC he believed the end of the EU was now just \"a matter of time\". He also tweeted that it was \"time for a Dutch referendum\". Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National in France \"Victory for freedom!

However, the British people have spoken and we fully respect their decision. \"Ireland will, of course, remain a member of the European Union. That is profoundly in our national interest.\" After the UK leaves the EU, its only land border with an EU country will be between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mr Kenny said the Irish government would \"do our utmost\" to maintain a pre-EU agreement of an open border for travellers and \"minimise any possible disruptions to the flow of people, goods and services between these islands\". More on Ireland's reaction Manuel Valls, French Prime Minister \"It's an explosive shock. At stake is the break-up pure and simple of the union. \"Now is the time to invent another Europe.\" Vladimir Putin, Russian President \"A statement by the Prime Minister of Great Britain Mr Cameron before... the referendum, in which he voiced the position of Russia [that Moscow would benefit from Brexit] has no basis. I think this is nothing more than a flawed attempt to influence public opinion in his own country. \"As we can see, even this did not bring the right result for those who did it, and moreover after the vote no-one has the right to make statements about some position of Russia. This is nothing more than a demonstration of the low level of political culture.\" Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine \"Today the most urgent challenge the European Union is facing is finding a way to the hearts and minds of Eurosceptics in order not to leave a single chance to opponents of the European integration project and their generous sponsors. I do hope that the sanctions against Russia as an aggressor state will be extended.\" Jens Stoltenberg, Nato Secretary General \"The UK will remain a strong and committed Nato ally, and will continue to play its leading role in our alliance. \"Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, Nato is more important than ever as a platform for co-operation among European allies, and between Europe and North America.

It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down.\" Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of Greece \"Brexit will be either a wake-up call or the beginning of a dangerous path for European people. \"We respect the decision of British people, which confirms the deep political and identity crisis of the EU. \"The extreme choices of austerity that widened the inequality between countries of the north and south, fences and closed borders and the denial to share the burden of the debt and migrant crises had signalled an extended crisis in Europe.\" UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman \"Now, as the United Kingdom and other EU member states embark on the process of charting a way forward, the secretary general trusts in Europe's well-proven history of pragmatism and common responsibility in the interest of European citizens. \"At the UN, we look forward to continuing our work with the United Kingdom and the European Union - both important partners. \"The secretary general expects the European Union to continue to be a solid partner for the United Nations on development and humanitarian issues, as well as peace and security, including migration. \"He also expects that the United Kingdom will continue to exercise its leadership in many areas, including development.

Our banks and financial institutions are well positioned to withstand financial shocks to the system as demonstrated in previous episodes including the 2008/09 global financial crisis. \"We are therefore confident that our financial system including the banks and the regulatory framework are extremely resilient and reliable.\" Statement in full Robert Fico, Prime Minister of Slovakia \"Let's realise that a great part of people living in Europe reject the EU's migration policy, there is great dissatisfaction with the EU's economic policy. \"It is up to us, the remaining 27 union member states, whether we find enough strength to say that fundamental policies of the EU must go through fundamental changes.\" Slovakia will take on the six-month presidency of the EU from next month. Bohuslav Sobotka, Czech Prime Minister \"Britain's decision is serious and irreversible. \"The EU has to change.

We will go on and stay strong with 27, but EU will not be the same without Great Britain\" Timo Soini, Finnish Foreign Minister from the eurosceptic Finns Party \"The nation has had its say.\" Speaking of the negotiations that must come between the UK and the EU following this vote, he said: \"Any retaliation and whinge is out of the question.\" Binali Yildirim, Prime Minister of Turkey \"The EU should read this development very well and reassess its future vision.\" Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of Moldova \"A sad day for Europe and for European and international friends of Great Britain. \"The European edifice needs reconfirmation more than ever. Moldova remains attached to its European course despite the results of the referendum in the UK because we consider the EU a successful project and we want to be part of it, based on reforms, during the next years.\" Klaus Iohannis, President of Romania \"Romania will negotiate so that its interest is protected and the interest of our citizens who live and work in Great Britain is protected.\" Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway \"British voters and many other voters around Europe feel that the EU is not providing good enough answers to today's challenges.\" Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan \"We are very concerned over the risks to the global economy, and financial and exchange markets.\" Hua Chunying, Spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry \"A prosperous Europe is in the interests of all parties and China is willing to keep co-operating with Britain and is fully confident in China-EU ties.\" Arun Jaitley, Indian Finance Minister \"In this globalized world, volatility and uncertainty are the new norms. This verdict will obviously further contribute to such volatility not least because its full implications for the UK, Europe and the rest of the world are still uncertain. \"All countries around the world will have to brace themselves for a period of possible turbulence while being watchful about, and alert to, the referendum's medium term impacts.\" Najib Abdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia \"There will be testing times ahead for the UK. But the British people should know that one old friend will always be with them, as they open a new chapter in their long history.\" Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore \"Other developed countries also face similar challenges as Britain. We all live in a globalised, interdependent world. The desire to disengage, to be less constrained by one's partners, to be free to do things entirely as one chooses, is entirely understandable. And yet in reality for many countries, disengaging and turning inwards will likely lead to less security, less prosperity, and a dimmer future. \"Singapore will continue to cultivate our ties with Britain, which is a long standing friend and partner.\" Malcolm Turnbull, Australian Prime Minister \"The impact on Australia immediately, directly, from a legal point of view, will be very limited because it will take some years for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, to negotiate an exit. However, we've seen already large falls on stock markets and there will be a degree of uncertainty for some time.\"",

    "text": "The Islamist-rooted ruling AK party says the law will protect the population, particularly young people, from the harmful effects of alcohol. Critics say it is a new move to impose an Islamic agenda on a secular, though predominantly Muslim, country. The law bans the sale of alcohol in shops between 22:00 and 06:00 and bans producers from sponsoring events. To take effect, the law must be signed by President Abdullah Gul. Mr Gul, a former member of the ruling AKP, is expected to do so soon. Diageo Plc, the world's largest distiller of alcoholic beverages, has expressed concern about the legislation. In 2011, Diageo bought Mey Icki, a producer of the traditional Turkish spirit raki, for $2.1bn (£1.7bn). It said this week it had bought the company in the belief it was investing in a country \"that encouraged foreign investment\". 'Drink yoghurt' In other points of the new law Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who does not drink or smoke, said recently that ayran, a non-alcoholic yoghurt drink, was the \"national drink\" of the Turks. AKP politician Lutfu Elva, head of the planning and budget commission, defended the law, saying similar restrictions were in place in Scandinavian countries. But Musa Cam, an MP from the main opposition party, the CHP, said: \"No one can be forced to drink or not to drink. This is a religious and ideological imposition.\" Quoted in an article in Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, he said: \"This is not a struggle against the ills of alcohol but an attempt to redesign the society according to their [AK party] beliefs and lifestyle.\" Hasip Kaplan, a Kurdish MP, warned the law would hurt tourism, which \"can't recover easily once collapsed\", the state-run Anatolia news agency reports.

    "text": "Women with large tumours and cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes had the highest 40% risk of it coming back. Researchers writing in the New England Journal of Medicine said extending treatment with hormone therapy could reduce the risk of it recurring. Scientists analysed the progress of 63,000 women for 20 years. All had the most common form of breast cancer. This is a type fuelled by the hormone oestrogen which can stimulate cancer cells to grow and divide. Every patient received treatments such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors which block the effects of oestrogen or shut off the hormone's supply. Although after five years of treatment their cancers had gone, over the next 15 years a steady number of women found that their cancer spread throughout their body - some up to 20 years after diagnosis. Women who originally had large tumours and cancer that had spread to four or more lymph nodes were at highest risk of the cancer returning the next 15 years, the study said. Women with small, low-grade cancers and no spread to the lymph nodes had a much lower 10% risk of cancer spread over that time. 'Remarkable' Lead researcher Dr Hongchao Pan, from University of Oxford, said: \"It is remarkable that breast cancer can remain dormant for so long and then spread many years later, with this risk remaining the same year after year and still strongly related to the size of the original cancer and whether it had spread to the (lymph) nodes.\" Doctors have long known that five years of tamoxifen reduces the risk of recurrence by about a third in the five years after stopping treatment. Recent research has suggested that extending hormone therapy to 10 years may be more effective at preventing breast cancer recurrence and death. Aromatase inhibitors, which only work for post-menopausal women, are believed to be even more effective. But there are side effects with hormone treatments which can affect patients' quality of life and cause them to stop taking the pills. These include menopausal symptoms, osteporosis, joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome. Prof Arnie Purushotham, senior clinical adviser at Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said that since the research began, new drugs had been used to treat breast cancer and those worked in different ways to tamoxifen. He said: \"It's vital that work continues to better predict which cancers might return. \"We also need to know what the difference for women might be in taking hormone therapies for 10 years instead of five, the side effects and how this affects patients' quality of life.\" Sally Greenbook, from charity Breast Cancer Now, said it was essential that women discussed any changes in treatment with their doctor. \"We would urge all women who have had treatment for breast cancer not to be alarmed, but to ensure they are aware of the signs of recurrence and of metastatic breast cancer, and to speak to their GP or breast care team if they have any concerns.\"",

    "text": "The ARA San Juan submarine disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast on 15 November 2017. The navy stopped its rescue mission two weeks after the sub's disappearance. However, a year and a day after it went missing, officials announced it had been found 800m (2,620ft) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. According to a tweet from the Argentine navy, the ARA San Juan had been positively identified under the water by a US company. The navy had earlier shared a picture from the seabed, suggesting a 60m-long object might be the missing submarine. Relatives gathered to remember their loved ones earlier this week, while President Mauricio Macri promised to keep up the search for the submarine. What happened to the sub? The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, when it reported an \"electrical breakdown\". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a \"short circuit\" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters last year that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped on to a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared.",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come. Their answer - \"the planetary health diet\" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. What changes am I going to have to make? If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on \"starchy vegetables\" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. So what is the diet in detail? If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: The diet has room for 31g of sugar and about 50g worth of oils like olive oil. How do your food choices impact on the environment? Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. Update your browser to have a go! How do your food choices impact on the environment? Your results are below Will it taste awful? Prof Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet. \"There's tremendous variety there,\" he said. \"You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable.\" Is this for real, or just a fantasy? This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. \"Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,\" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. \"Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,\" she says. Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets. Who came up with this? A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together as part of the EAT-Lancet commission. They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet. Why do we need a diet for 10 billion people? The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep on climbing. Will it save lives? The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year. That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. How bad is farming for the planet? The use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet. When you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. Similarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation. So will this diet save the planet? The researchers' aim was to feed more people while: However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. To make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. Why isn't meat being banned? \"If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,\" said Prof Willet. However, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. So what happens now? The EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat. Follow James on Twitter",

    "text": "US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper says he has authorised the deployment of additional forces, including fighter jets and a defence system. He said it was in response to \"threats in the region\", amid efforts to protect the kingdom from \"Iranian aggression\". The move comes after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities in September. \"Taken together with other deployments, this constitutes an additional 3,000 forces that have been extended or authorised within the last month,\" Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said. The US has increased the deployment of forces in the region by 14,000 since May, according to CNN. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had requested additional support, Mr Esper said. The attack on Saudi oil facilities knocked out 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. Both Saudi Arabia and the US blame Iran for the incident. Mohammed bin Salman said: \"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests.\" Iran has denied allegations it was behind the attack. However the leaders of France, Germany and the UK said in a joint statement that there was no other plausible explanation for the attacks. Mr Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that the evidence from other recent attacks in the region proved Iran was to blame. He said the \"malign behaviour\" was a part of the country's \"larger campaign to destabilise the Middle East and disrupt the global economy\". \"Iran's attempts to use terror, intimidation and military force to advance its interests are inconsistent with international norms,\" Mr Esper added. \"Saudi Arabia is a longstanding security partner in the Middle East and has asked for addition support to supplement their own defences and defend the international rules-based order.\" Always on the verge of coming home Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent You would be forgiven for feeling confused about President Trump's attitude to US military deployments in the Middle East. At one point in the past few days he was tweeting about the \"trillions of dollars\" that America had wasted on \"endless wars\" in the region and vowing that the US would \"back out\" of Middle East conflicts. Yet here we are with a further 3,000 service personnel and a bunch of hardware heading for Saudi Arabia and the region - making a net 17,000 increase in troop numbers since May. So unquestionably the rhetoric and the reality are in conflict. President Trump is not the first incumbent of the White House to face these contradictory pressures. President Barack Obama had to reverse his pledge in 2015 to bring all American troops, bar a handful, home from Afghanistan. There are 14,000 of them there to this day. And the 2011 withdrawal of troops from Iraq had to be revisited when the vacuum left created space for al-Qaeda and then the Islamic State group. The truth is that as a world superpower, America's national interest cannot be contained within the bounds of the two shining seas that many of the early political pioneers thought would protect it from foreign entanglements. Yet the president, in similar fashion to some of his predecessors, has to persist in the assertion that troops are always on the verge of coming home. He and they do it for sound political reasons: that's what the American people, in general, want to hear. President Donald Trump has often defended the US relationship with Saudi Arabia and its leader, calling the kingdom a vital ally with a record amount of investments in the US. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have cast a critical eye over the kingdom since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the civil war in Yemen. In June, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to block the sale of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia in a rebuke of Mr Trump. US lawmakers have expressed concerns that Saudi-led forces would use the weapons against civilians in Yemen. As the US prepares to send more support to the kingdom, Mr Trump has also faced pushback from Congress on his decision to pull troops from Syria. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham both criticised the withdrawal as irresponsible, saying it risks allowing terrorist organisations to regroup. On Monday, Mr Trump defended the move, saying: \"We want to bring our soldiers back home. These are endless wars.\" The president has been vocal about the matter on Twitter this week, calling US involvement in the Middle East the \"worst decision ever made in the history of our country\".",

    "text": "Microsoft's XBox Live, Blizzard's Battle.net, and Grinding Gear Games are among others to have reported being disrupted over the weekend. The attacks coincided with a bomb scare involving a flight carrying a Sony executive. An American Airlines jet was diverted after a threat was made online. A warning that the flight - from Dallas-Fort Worth to San Diego - was carrying explosives was subsequently repeated by a Twitter account that had been used to claim responsibility for the online attacks. John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, had been tweeting about his firm's efforts to combat a \"large scale DDoS\" before posting a message saying he was about to board the plane. DDoS stands for distributed denial of service attack - a technique in which many computers are used to flood an online service with requests in an attempt to overload its systems. After the threatened plane landed in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr Smedley tweeted: \"Yes, my plane was diverted. Not going to discuss more than that. Justice will find these guys.\" A spokeswoman for Sony said that the FBI was now investigating the diversion. However, the Bureau has yet to issue a statement of its own. Jihadist links A Twitter account that has claimed responsibility for attacking Sony and the other video games firms has linked the attacks to the jihadist group Islamic State, posting: \"Kuffar [non-believers] don't get to play videogames until bombing of the ISIL stops.\" It also makes several references to Isis - the former name used by the Islamic militants. But it is unclear whether this is a diversionary tactic, since an earlier post by the same account states: \"Sony, yet another large company, but they aren't spending the waves of cash they obtain on their customers' PSN service. End the greed.\" To complicate matters another hacker, who is associated with the Anonymous hacking collective, has claimed responsibility for the DDoS on the PlayStation Network, saying they mounted it to highlight vulnerabilities in Sony's system. This hacker has criticised the other claims of responsibility and posted screenshots that purport to support their case. Xbox disruption Sony's PlayStation Network was notably taken offline for more than three weeks in 2011 after a hack attack that compromised its members' personal details and exposed their encrypted debit and credit card accounts. However, the firm's social media manager has sought to reassure subscribers about the latest attack. \"We have seen no evidence of any intrusion to the network and no evidence of any unauthorized access to users' personal information,\" Sid Shuman blogged. \"In light of today's issue, the networks will not undergo the regularly scheduled maintenance, which was planned for Monday, August 25. \"We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused by this issue.\" Microsoft declined to \"comment on the root cause\" of disruption its rival Xbox Live online gaming service has faced. However, a message on is support site stated that Xbox One owners were experiencing \"server unavailability issues\" when trying to join other players in online games. The webpage also mentions problems faced by owners of the Xbox 360 trying to connect to Diablo III's party chat feature. This appears to be a consequence of an attack on Activision Blizzard's gaming service Battle.net, which also supports World of Warcraft and Starcraft titles. \"Battle.net game services have recently been subject to DDoS attacks. We worked diligently along with our ISPs [internet service providers] to improve the situation and currently are seeing more stability,\" said a message posted to the facility's site. Meanwhile, Grinding Gear Games posted a message on the Twitter account of its game Path of Exile on Sunday, saying: \"We're having some server issues due to a DDoS attack. Should have it sorted out soon. Sorry for the inconvenience!\" The incidents follow reports of earlier DDoS attacks on other multiplayer titles on Friday, including Eve Online, League of Legends, RuneScape and Guild Wars 2.",

King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, became the constitutional monarch after the death of his much-loved father in 2016. He has been married and divorced three times before and has seven children. A royal statement said: King Vajiralongkorn \"has decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida and she will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family\". Queen Suthida is King Vajiralongkorn's long-term partner and has been seen with him in public for many years, though their relationship has never before been officially acknowledged. Footage from the wedding ceremony was shown on Thai TV channels late Wednesday, showing other members of the royal family and palace advisers in attendance. The king is seen pouring sacred water on the head of Queen Suthida. The couple then sign a marriage registry. She and others are prostrated before the monarch, as is customary in Thailand. In 2014 Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, as the deputy commander of his bodyguard unit. He made her a full general in the army in December 2016. The previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, ruled for 70 years, making him the longest-reigning monarch in the world when he died in 2016.",

    "text": "Unesco says its destruction would be \"an enormous loss to humanity\", but no damage has been reported there yet. IS now controls the nearby airport, prison and intelligence HQ, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. The militants have previously demolished ancient sites in Iraq that pre-date Islam. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says acute international concern over Palmyra might actually spur the jihadists on to make destroying the site a priority. The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. Palmyra is also close to oil and gas fields. Elsewhere in Syria, 40 rebels from Islamist factions were killed in Aleppo when government forces bombed a rebel headquarters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Loudspeakers An activist who has family members in Palmyra told the BBC that his relatives wanted to flee but there was no way out. IS fighters were searching the city for Syrian army soldiers, he said, and residents were being warned via mosque loudspeakers not to hide them. He also said the inhabitants were angry that Western media are focusing on the ancient ruins, and not the population. \"We still don't have accurate figures about how many civilians there are in Palmyra but there are plenty,\" he said. \"People think the West cares more about the civilisation than about the people who created or initiated this civilisation.\" Tadmur, the Arabic name for the modern settlement next to Palmyra, would normally have a population of around 70,000, but it has recently been swollen by an influx of people displaced from other combat areas. Syrian state media said pro-government forces had pulled out after \"assuring the evacuation\" of \"most\" of its inhabitants. Talal Barazi, the Governor of Homs Province, which includes Palmyra, told the Associated Press that 1,300 people had fled the city over the past few days, and more were trying to leave. Saving history from the jihadists Rising out of the desert, the site contains the monumental ruins of a great city, which Unesco and others consider one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world. Dating back to the 1st and 2nd Century, when the region was under Roman rule, Palmyra is dominated by a grand, colonnaded street. The Syrian Observatory reported that more than 100 pro-government troops were killed in overnight clashes around Palmyra. A researcher from the monitoring group also told the BBC on Friday that IS now controls more than half of Syrian territory. However, the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher says this figure may give a false impression because there are large areas to the east under IS control that are not very significant strategically. Analysis: Jim Muir, BBC News, Beirut Many questions will now be asked in Damascus and Baghdad - and above all in Washington - about how the militants have managed to score major advances in both Iraq and Syria this week despite all the efforts to stop them. IS was supposed to be on the defensive in Iraq, where the prime minister announced weeks ago the launching of a campaign to drive the militants out of Anbar province. Now he's lost its capital, Ramadi, just days before they took Palmyra in Syria. The Western coalition's bombing campaign has clearly hurt IS where it could. But it could never compensate for ground forces which are not competent, equipped or motivated enough to stand firm and hit back. Only the Kurds in the north of both countries (most recently in north-eastern Syria) have proven able to do that. IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Your memories of Palmyra Unesco's director-general, Irina Bokova, said any destruction to Palmyra would be \"not just a war crime but... an enormous loss to humanity\". \"It belongs to the whole of humanity and I think everyone today should be worried about what is happening,\" she said in a video statement. Ms Bokova told the BBC that protecting sites like Palmyra had become a security imperative, as well as a cultural concern, because, she claimed, the militias were using trafficked artefacts to get funds: \"These are not some lovers of art,\" she said. \"This is part of the financing of extremism and it is absolutely imperative that we stop these channels of illicit trafficking.\" 'World's battle' Syria's head of antiquities, Maamoun Abdul Karim, said on Wednesday that hundreds of Palmyra's statues had been moved to safety but that large monuments could not be transferred. \"This is the entire world's battle,\" Mr Abdul Karim warned.",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News The US team believe the \"waste removal system\" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that \"housework\" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. \"The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up,\" said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. \"You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time.\" Plumbing Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a \"vital\" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: \"This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information.\" She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: \"This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. \"There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important.\" Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: \"It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. \"The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. \"The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects.\" Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a \"potential new avenue for investigation\".",

    "text": "Mr Bolton provided no evidence to support the allegation, which Iran said was \"laughable\". The attacks off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates on 12 May left holes in the hulls of four ships. The incident came amid an escalation in tensions between Iran and the US. Last Friday, US Vice Admiral Michael Gilday said he believed \"with a high degree of confidence that this [attack] stems back to the leadership of Iran at the highest levels\". Mr Bolton, a long-standing advocate for regime change in Iran, echoed the admiral's words during a visit to the UAE on Wednesday, telling reporters it was \"clear that Iran is behind\" the attack. \"There's no doubt in anybody's mind in Washington who's responsible for this,\" he said. \"Who else would you think is doing it? Someone from Nepal?\" But Abbas Mousavi, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr Bolton's accusations were \"ludicrous\". \"Iran's strategic patience, vigilance and defensive prowess will defuse mischievous plots made by Bolton and other warmongers.\" In another development, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran will not negotiate any new deals with the US over its nuclear and missile programmes, calling negotiations \"useless\". Earlier President Hassan Rouhani signalled talks were possible if sanctions were lifted. What do we know about the incident? Few details have been released, but it took place at about 06:00 (02:00 GMT) on Sunday, 12 May, within UAE territorial waters east of the emirate of Fujairah, just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The UAE authorities said four ships were targeted in a \"sabotage attack\". There were no casualties but Saudi Arabia said two of its ships had suffered \"significant damage\". Another tanker was Norwegian-registered, while the fourth was UAE-flagged. The UAE has not publicly blamed anyone for the sabotage of the vessels. What has this got to do with the US and Iran? On paper, little. No US-flagged ship was attacked, and no evidence has been provided that Iran was involved. But the US sees the attack as part of a wider \"campaign\" against it and its allies approved by Iranian leaders. Mr Bolton said Iran-backed forces also carried out drone strikes on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia on 14 May and fired a rocket into an area of the Iraqi capital Baghdad that houses the US embassy on 19 May. He also revealed that there had been \"an unsuccessful attack on the Saudi port of Yanbu a couple of days before the attack on tankers\". Iran has denied it was involved in the attacks in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. What is behind the heightened US-Iran tensions? The tensions began rising at the start of May, when Washington ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions a year ago after abandoning the landmark 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with six nations - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany. Iran has now announced it it will suspend several commitments under the deal.",

    "text": "The stage and screen actor was well-known for a range of roles, including the 1960 classic Spartacus, in which he played the titular character. Born in New York in 1916, he rose to prominence during Hollywood's \"golden age\", earning his first Oscar nomination for the 1949 film Champion. He was also the father of Oscar-winning actor Michael Douglas. His son Michael said in a statement: \"It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today.\" \"To the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies... but to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad,\" it read in part. \"Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad - I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\" Michael's wife and Kirk's daughter-in-law, Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones, posted a photo of the two together, writing: \"I shall love you for the rest of my life. I miss you already.\" An icon who defied convention Analysis by Peter Bowes, BBC News, Los Angeles When I met Kirk Douglas in 2008 he was a sprightly 91. He talked about his advancing years and the impact a stroke, in 1996, had on his skills as an actor. \"I couldn't talk at all,\" he told me. \"So what does an actor do who can't talk? He waits for silent pictures to come back! That's a corny joke,\" he chuckled. Douglas was particularly proud of his role in ending the Hollywood blacklist, when he defied the ban on working with filmmakers with alleged communist ties or sympathies. He said he drew on \"the impulsive qualities of younger Kirk\" in making his decision to give the blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo a screen credit under his own name for his work on Spartacus. We discussed his passion for working with young people. He had started writing a blog to encourage young Americans to vote in that year's presidential election. Douglas and his wife donated millions of dollars to charitable causes and helped build hundreds of school playgrounds. He said their philosophy was: \"Before you die, try to do something for other people.\" Douglas was prolific as a film actor, with more than 90 credits to his name - ranging from the 1940s to the 2000s. He is perhaps best-known for Spartacus, a Stanley Kubrick film which won four Oscars and was so popular that its iconic \"I am Spartacus\" scene entered the pop cultural lexicon. Douglas was himself nominated for an Oscar three times - for Champion (1949), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), and Lust for Life (1956). He eventually won the honorary award in 1996 in recognition of his 50 years in the industry. He faced difficulties in his personal life. He narrowly survived a helicopter crash in 1991 that left two people dead. Five years later, he suffered a major stroke that affected his speech. And in 2004, his son Eric died at the age of 46 of an accidental drug overdose. In his later years, he turned his attention to charity. He donated millions of dollars to charitable causes and helped fund an Alzheimer's unit at a retirement home in Los Angeles. World-famous director Steven Spielberg, who knew Douglas personally, told the Hollywood Reporter that he made a \"breathtaking body of work\". \"Kirk retained his movie star charisma right to the end of his wonderful life and I'm honoured to have been a small part of his last 45 years,\" Spielberg said. After the news of his death broke, fans gathered at his star set in the ground on the Hollywood walk of fame. \"He was one of the last Hollywood legends of the golden era. That's it. Not a superstar, a legend,\" one man, Gregg Donovan, told news agency AFP. \"It's devastating. I mean, I know he lived to 103, God bless him, but you just don't think he's going to leave us and it's such a sad day in Hollywood, I'll tell you.\"",

His first appeal was rejected by the Mumbai High Court in February 2011. The November 2008 attacks claimed 166 lives. Nine gunmen were also killed. \"In view of the nature of the gravity of his crime and the fact that he participated in waging war against the country, we have no option but to uphold his death penalty,\" Supreme Court Justices Aftab Alam and CK Prasad ruled. Legal experts say it could still be months or even years before Qasab's sentence can be carried out. He has the right to appeal to the same two judges to review his case. If that fails he can take his appeal to other Supreme Court judges. His last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president. The BBC's Andrew North in Delhi says there will now be huge pressure for the death sentence to be carried out soon. A spokesman for India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said there should be \"no delay\" in executing Qasab. \"Those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy,\" he said. 'Complete victory' Prosecutor Gopal Subramaniam hailed the verdict as \"a complete victory of the due processes of law\". \"It was a case argued in a completely professional and dispassionate manner,\" Mr Subramaniam said. Defence lawyer Raju Ramachandran told reporters outside the court that he had made his arguments and \"the court considered them\". \"I bow to the verdict,\" he added. The trial court in Mumbai had found Qasab guilty on 3 May 2010 of murder, terrorist acts and waging war on India and sentenced him to death. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Qasab argued that the prosecution had \"failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt\" the charges against him. He said he \"may be guilty of killing people and carrying out a terrorist act but I am not guilty of waging war against the state\". The 60-hour siege of Mumbai began on 26 November 2008, targeting luxury hotels, the main railway station and a Jewish cultural centre. Qasab and an accomplice carried out the assault on the station, killing 52 people. India blamed Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attacks. After initial denials, Pakistan acknowledged that the assault had been partially planned on its territory and that Qasab was a Pakistani citizen.",

Researchers at Imperial College, London, say women can reduce their risk with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise and keeping a healthy weight. The World Cancer Research Fund report also found that coffee may reduce risk. But experts say there is not yet enough evidence to recommend drinking coffee to protect against the disease. Endometrial cancer - cancer of the womb lining - is the fourth most common of all cancers in women in the UK. In the first global analysis since 2007, Imperial College London researchers collated and reviewed scientific research on endometrial cancer, and links with diet, physical activity and body weight. The study found evidence that about 3,700 cases could be prevented every year if women were active for 38 minutes a day and maintained a healthy body weight. In the UK only 56% of women follow recommendations to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week, while only 39% have a healthy weight. Study author Dr Teresa Norat of Imperial College told the BBC: \"If you are physically active and if you don't have excess body weight you can reduce your risk of womb cancer and improve your health in general.\" Karen Sadler, executive director of the World Cancer Research Fund added: \"The evidence on coffee is very interesting and is a further indication of the potential link between coffee and the risk of cancer but a lot more work still needs to be done. \"We need to consider the possible effect on other cancers as well as the impact on other health conditions and we are now looking to conduct further research into this issue.\"",

Messi's net salary from Barcelona is said to be about 16m euros a year, making him one of the world's most highly-paid sportspeople.

He came from a modest background and has overcome a serious health issue, joining Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000 and making his first-team debut only three years later. He was ranked 10th among Forbes' list of sports stars' incomes this month. The president of Barcelona FC, Sandro Rosell, has said the club has no doubt that the superstar is innocent of tax avoidance. Messi is due to play a prominent role in the Adidas World Cup marketing campaign. Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer told reporters that the company \"will continue to work with Lionel. He's the best football player in the world and we are happy that we have him\". But the allegations are a big blow to the prestige of Messi, who has long been seen as a more humble figure than most top-class footballers.",

    "text": "The countries' foreign ministers called each other and \"exchanged greetings following the historic peace accord\", a statement said. The US-brokered deal was announced by President Donald Trump on Thursday. It is only the third Israeli-Arab peace treaty in the Middle East. The international community has mostly welcomed the move, although Palestinians, Iran and Turkey have denounced it. Under the terms of the deal, Israel has agreed to suspend its controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Israeli foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi - who held a call with his Emirati counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan - tweeted on Sunday that the two sides \"decided together on the establishment of a direct communication channel ahead of the signing of the normalisation agreement between the two countries and... to meet soon\". Israel's communications ministry said telecoms providers in the UAE had unblocked calls to numbers with Israel's +972 country code. \"I congratulate the United Arab Emirates on the unblocking,\" said Israeli communications minister Yoaz Hendel. \"Many economic opportunities will now open up and these trust-building steps are important for advancing the countries' interests.\" The two sides are expected the sign the accord in Washington in three weeks' time. Normalising relations will include opening embassies on each other's territory. In another sign of the new, closer relationship, the two countries signed an agreement on Saturday relating to Covid-19 research. Until now Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. But shared concerns over Iran have led to unofficial contacts between them. President Trump's chief adviser, Jared Kushner, told CBS he and President Trump had been working on a deal between Israel and the UAE since Mr Trump came to office. The agreement reportedly took Palestinian leaders by surprise. A spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas said the deal amounted to \"treason\". Since Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 it has only signed peace deals with two other Arab countries - Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. Mauritania, a member of the Arab League in north-west Africa, established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999 but severed ties in 2010. Mr Trump has said he expects more Arab and Muslim countries to sign treaties with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had \"delayed\" West Bank annexation plans, but those plans remained \"on the table\". Annexation would make some West Bank areas officially part of Israel, dealing a blow for Palestinian plans for a state of their own.",

    "text": "In a statement, he said the two worst affected provinces, Leyte and Samar, had suffered massive destruction and loss of life. Thousands of survivors are still desperately waiting for the aid effort to reach them. At least 10,000 people are feared to have been killed. Tacloban is one of the worst affected cities. The BBC's Jon Donnison, who is there, says there does not yet seem to be an effective operation to get help to those in need. This is expected to change over the next few days, he says. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced after the high winds and floodwaters destroyed their homes. Damage to roads and airports has delayed the delivery of aid. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the UN would launch a large-scale humanitarian plan on Tuesday. He called for UN member states to show solidarity with the people of the Philippines. \"We have all seen the heartbreaking images of the impact of this huge storm,\" he said. One of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall, Haiyan - named \"Yolanda\" by Philippine authorities - struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Struggle More than nine million people have been affected in the Philippines. Many are now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. A picture is slowly emerging of the full damage wrought by the storm: A huge international relief effort is under way, but rescue workers have struggled to reach areas cut off since the storm. However, reports from Tacloban say soldiers have been distributing food and water to some residents and the US military has sent marines to the city. The head of the Philippine Red Cross, Richard Gordon, described the situation as \"absolute bedlam\". \"It's only now that they were able to get in and we're beginning just to bring in the necessary food items... as well as water and other things that they need,\" he told the BBC. Jane Cocking, the humanitarian director for Oxfam, said her colleagues witnessed \"complete devastation\". A Philippine military spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday that 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected. The UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, was is her way to the Philippines. A priority of the UN's response teams once on the ground would be the burial of bodies to meet concerns about public health, UN humanitarian official John Ging said. \"We are certainly expecting the worst,\" he added. \"As we get more and more access we find the tragedy of more and more people killed in this typhoon.\" 'Unprecedented' storm Some are questioning what more authorities could have done to prepare for this, just the latest in a string of disasters to hit the nation of more than 7,000 islands. Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the typhoon arrived, but many evacuation centres - schools, churches and government buildings - proved unable to withstand the winds and storm surges. Haiyan brought sustained winds of 235km/h (147mph), with gusts of 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves as high as 15m (45ft). In some places, as much as 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain fell. Officials said looting was widespread and order was proving difficult to enforce. Correspondents say many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. In some areas, the dead are being buried in mass graves. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu, with relief efforts focusing on Tacloban. Other countries have also pledged millions of dollars in assistance. Britain is earmarking £10m ($15); Australia has approved $9m in humanitarian aid to the Philippines; while New Zealand has pledged over $1m. Typhoon Haiyan later made landfall in Vietnam, near the tourist destination of Ha Long Bay, with sustained winds of up to 140 km/h (85mph). Despite losing much of its strength, the storm still felled trees and damaged buildings, with reports of some casualties. Some 600,000 people were evacuated in northern provinces of the country.",

The priest, Nikolaos Kakavelakis, 52, was shot twice with a sawn-off shotgun outside his church on 31 October. He spoke to police after coming out of a coma on Wednesday. The shooting came days after three people were killed in a knife attack at a church in the southern French city of Nice. It was initially feared to be a copycat of what French President Emmanuel Macron called an \"Islamist terrorist attack\" in Nice. The motive for the shooting in Lyon was not clear at first, with officials opening an investigation for attempted murder. But the investigation progressed this week when the priest was able to talk to the police. The suspect, who is said to be of Georgian nationality, was arrested at his home in Lyon on Friday, French newspaper Le Parisien reported. The newspaper, citing a statement from Lyon's public prosecutor, Nicolas Jacquet, said the suspect \"turns out to be the husband of a woman who was having an affair with the victim\". The suspect told prosecutors he had not intended to kill the priest, who was romantically involved with his wife, a 35-year-old Russian, the newspaper said. The priest, who is recovering after surgery, had announced his resignation from the church a month earlier.",

    "text": "About 10,000 dogs will be slaughtered for their meat at the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival in Yulin in Guangxi province on Sunday and Monday to mark the summer solstice, state media said. One retired school teacher from Tianjin hit the headlines when she purchased dozens of dogs to save them. Residents and vendors in Yulin say the animals are killed in a humane way. Activists say the killing is cruel and an online campaign to ban the festival has been signed by more than 3.8 million people so far and the campaign has attracted considerable support this year from celebrities both domestic and foreign. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have spoken out on Twitter with the hashtag #StopYuLin2015. Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actor Yang Mi have said they are joining the campaign on micro blogging site Weibo. Why UK doesn't eat dog meat And Chinese actor Fan Bingbing and others posted a video online against the festival. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, this festival began in recent years, Xinhua said. City officials have distanced themselves from the gathering. \"Some residents of Yulin have the habit of coming together to eat lychees and dog meat during the summer solstice,\" the city's news office wrote on Weibo. \"The 'summer solstice lychee and dog meat festival' is a commercial term, the city has never [officially] organised a 'dog meat festival',\" it added. As in recent years, some animal lovers resorted to buying some of the dogs in order to rescue them. Yang Xiaoyun, retired school teacher, paid about 7,000 yuan ($1,100; £710) to save 100 dogs on Saturday. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says this kind of dispute puts the government in a really difficult position. The glorified consumption of dog meat generates a lot of negative foreign media reports, embarrassing the authorities. Also, the dog meat industry has been accused of many underhand tactics, including the illegal capture of family pets to use as food. But at the same time, the government is wary of the increasingly sophisticated animal rights movement, she adds. Animal rights activists in China have formed a cohesive network on social media that extends to many foreign animal welfare groups. China's leaders do not want to encourage such a movement amid a wider crackdown on civil disturbance of any kind.",

    "text": "This year 100 Women is asking: what would the future look like if it were driven by women? From climate change activist Greta Thunberg, to trans woman Nisha Ayub who was put into a male prison aged 21, many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030. Others, such as the \"ghost\" politician defying the mafia, and the footballer battling misogyny, are using their extraordinary personal experiences to blaze a path for those who follow. The BBC's 100 women of 2019 Precious Adams Precious Adams spent so much time dancing round the living room as a child, that her mum signed her up for dance lessons. She trained at several top ballet schools, including the National Ballet School of Canada, the Princess Grace Academy in Monaco and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She was promoted to first artist by the English National Ballet in 2017, and won the Emerging Artist Award at the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards the following year. She has been credited with opening up a conversation on ballet dancers being able to wear tights that match their skin tone. My hope for the future is that more and more people engage with the arts. I'd like as many people as possible to find the same joy, freedom, and fulfilment from the arts that I have. Parveena Ahanger Parveena is known as the \"Iron lady of Kashmir\". Her teenage son disappeared in 1990, at the height of an uprising against Indian rule in Kashmir. He is one of thousands of \"disappeared\" there - leading Parveena to set up the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). She says she has not given up hope of seeing her son again, with next year marking the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The grief of losing my son to enforced disappearance inspires me to struggle for justice and accountability, and I aspire to work towards making the world a better place, especially for women. Piera Aiello Known as Italy's \"ghost\" politician, Piera Aiello ran for office with her face covered by a veil due to threats from the mafia. In 2018, after winning her seat as an anti-mafia candidate, she finally revealed her face to the public. She has used her experience of being forced to marry the son of a mafia boss at 14 to advocate for the rights of police informants and their children. The truth lives on. Jasmin Akter Jasmin is Rohingya, described by the UN as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. She was born in a refugee camp in Bangladesh just after her father died. Since arriving in the UK as a refugee, she has excelled at cricket, and together with her friends started an all-Asian girls' cricket team in Bradford. This year she was selected to represent England in the first Street Child Cricket World Cup for charity. All I know is the feeling, the sheer pleasure of the motion feels greater when every breath blows with liberation. Manal AlDowayan Contemporary artist Manal AlDowayan's work explores invisibility, archives, memory and the representation of women in her country. From black and white photographs of Saudi Arabia's female workforce, to a frozen flock of birds imprinted with the permission slip Saudi women require to travel. In 2018, the British Museum placed two of her artworks on long-term display in the Islamic Gallery. Every day I am confronted with the incredible brilliance and courage of women around me, and I can only see a better future when these women have their place in society and history. Kimia Alizadeh In 2016, Kimia became the first Iranian woman to win a medal at the Olympics since the country began competing in 1948. As a taekwondo athlete, Kimia is credited with \"emboldening Iranian girls and women to push the boundaries of personal freedom\" by the UK's Financial Times newspaper. The 21-year-old is now training three times a day to seek qualification for Tokyo 2020, where she hopes to inspire the next generation of Iranian women in martial arts. In Iran, female athletes face different challenges. But I hope in the face of all the hardships we will continue and never give up. Alanoud Alsharekh Dr Alanoud Alsharekh is a founding member of the Abolish 153 campaign, calling for Kuwait's \"honour-killing\" law to be scrapped. She works with institutions to improve gender equality in the Middle East, and was the first Kuwaiti awarded France's National Order of Merit, for her defence of women's rights. Training and empowering future female leaders is a major issue that I am doing my part to see resolved in the immediate future, not only in Kuwait but across the region. Marwa Al-Sabouni When war broke out in architect Marwa Al-Sabouni's home city of Homs, Syria, she refused to leave. She has written a book documenting this time, and has drawn up plans to rebuild the destroyed Baba Amr district, in a way that would bring different classes and ethnic groups together. She runs the world's only website dedicated to architectural news in Arabic, and has received the Prince Claus award, which honours “outstanding achievement of visionaries at the front-line of culture and development”. Without home there is no future. My hope is that we can raise enough awareness to build places for people to which they can truly belong. It isn't an exaggeration to claim that much of the troubles of our time would be diminished through this act. Rida Al Tubuly Rida Al Tubuly is one of many women pushing for gender equality - but she's doing it from a warzone. Her organisation, Together We Build It, pushes for women's involvement in solving Libya's conflict. In 2018, she told the Human Rights Council in Geneva that high level UN meetings about Libya's future were failing to include women. The university professor holds a postgraduate degree in International Human Rights Law. Women's future is now, not tomorrow and not the day after. I promote peace at all levels, and I'm confident that women are able to very soon change the status quo in fields historically designated to men, such as peace building and conflict mediation. Tabata Amaral Tabata Amaral, one of Brazil's youngest congresswomen, came to national attention this year when a video of her grilling the country's education minister went viral. Dubbed \"Brazil's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\" by the press, the 25-year-old grew up on the outskirts of Sao Paulo where she lost her father to drug addiction. Dedicating herself to her education, she won a place at Harvard University with a full scholarship, and graduated in Political Science and Astrophysics. As a member of parliament, her main agendas are education, women's rights, political innovation and sustainable futures. My biggest hope for the future of women in Brazil is that our fight for equal rights, for equal opportunities, be so consolidated that the next generation of girls will be born knowing no limits to their dreams. Yalitza Aparicio Yalitza Aparicio trained as a primary school teacher, but ended up being cast as the lead in Alfonso Cuarón's Oscar-winning film Roma after accompanying her sister to the audition. She became the first indigenous Mexican woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for the role. She now advocates for gender equality, rights for indigenous communities and constitutional protection for domestic workers. The ideal future for women is one in which we achieve gender equality; we have the same rights and the same opportunities men have. In the workplace, a future in which our pay is fair and we are compensated for the value we generate - that would be a good start. Dayna Ash Born in Lebanon but raised in the US, poet Dayna Ash was shocked when she was advised to hide her sexuality on her return to Beirut at 16. So she founded Haven for Artists, an all-inclusive organisation for artists and activists, and the city's only cultural and creative safe space for women and the LGBTQI+ community. She and her team run the centre for free, allowing vulnerable people to live in the residence and encouraging them to exchange tools, skills, and experience. Freedom is not only ours to demand but to design. Dina Asher-Smith Dina is the fastest woman in British history and the first British woman to win a major global sprint title. She took gold in the final of the women's 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, after she had already taken silver in the 100m. Sport allows you to view your body in a positive way as you see the amazing things it is able to do and how it can change. This helps to build self-esteem and leads to healthier lifestyles both in a physical and mental capacity. I want sport to be an area where young women can be unapologetically themselves. MiMi Aung NASA's MiMi Aung is responsible for a team designing a helicopter to fly on Mars. After travelling alone from Myanmar to the US to further her education at 16, MiMi is now project manager at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. She is challenged with building an aircraft light enough to fly in the very thin atmosphere of the Red Planet - it should reach the surface in February 2021. My view for the future is continued advancement and innovation of new capabilities. Personally for me, it has been about first-of-its-kind, increasingly capable autonomous systems for space exploration. I believe that critical thinking is key to making major advancements. Nisha Ayub At 21, trans woman Nisha Ayub was sentenced to three months in a male prison under a provision of Sharia law which prohibits \"a male person wearing women's attire or posing as a woman in a public space.” Since her release, she has been a tireless advocate for the rights of transgender people in Malaysia, co-founding SEED - the country's first ever trans-led organisation - and creating T-Home, which addresses the issue of homelessness for older trans women who are left without family support. She was awarded the US International Women of Courage award in 2016 for her work. Trans people are just as human as everyone. We cry in tears, we bleed red, we have dreams and hopes, we want to be loved and cared for, we have feelings and emotions as we are your own reflection... we are not asking for special rights but the same equal rights as others. Judith Bakirya Raised on a farm in Uganda, Judith Bakirya became the first of her peers to win a scholarship to a prestigious girls' boarding school, going on to obtain a masters in the UK and a job in the City. But unsatisfied in her work, she quit, using her savings to fly home and found an organic fruit farm, Busaino Fruits & Herbs. Since winning a national agriculture award, she has used the platform to draw attention to women's rights issues, including lack of land ownership, lack of access to education and domestic violence. Working with women smallholder garden owners in innovative ways, honouring indigenous knowledge and developing biodiverse agroecosystems, promotes sustainable food production and nutrition. Ayah Bdeir Branded as 21st Century building blocks, Ayah Bdeir's littleBits company makes kits of electronic blocks that snap together with magnets, allowing anyone to \"build, prototype, and invent\". Already used in thousands of schools across the US, this year Ayah launched a $4m value initiative with Disney to try and close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, (STEM), supplying 15,000 10-year-old girls in California with free littleBits kits. I am on a mission to make sure every kid — regardless of gender, background, or ethnicity — has the skills to invent the world they want to live in. Dhammananda Bhikkhuni Buddhism is Thailand's most common religion, with some 300,000 Buddhist monks. But female monks - known as bhikkhunis - aren't recognised, and are banned from being ordained on Thai soil. So in 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained, and returned as Thailand's first female monk. There are now 100 others like her. She is abbess of Songdhammakalyani - the country's first ever all-female Buddhist monastery. We still need to struggle to make the ordination of women in Thailand a reality. Mabel Bianco Feminist medical doctor Mabel Bianco has spent four decades putting women's health, reproductive rights, abortion, and HIV/AIDS on the public policy agenda in Argentina. She has introduced policies to save women's lives - from tackling breast cancer to violence against women - and has been a pioneer of sex education in the face of Roman Catholic conservatism. This year marks her 30th as president of the Foundation for Studies and Research on Women (FEIM) supporting the rights of women in Latin America and the world. I want a near future without women dying needlessly. I hope we will reach a point where women all over the world can decide freely about their lives, their bodies, and whether to be mothers or not without risking death, and are able to live without gender violence. Raya Bidshahri Raya is founder and CEO of the award-winning Awecademy, an organisation with a mission to use education to improve the world. It aims to inspire teachers and students with online learning modules like 21st Century Skills and Cosmic Citizenship, to bring positive change to humanity for the future. I am intelligently optimistic about the future. This is because the future of humanity is not pre-defined or set in stone, but rather it's up to us to create it. We can choose to create a future that is brimming with prosperity, progress, and love. Katie Bouman Katie was a key leader on the team that developed algorithms and techniques to recover the first-ever image of a black hole. She started the project as a graduate student, and is now an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Katie collaborated with a number of women on the Event Horizon Telescope team to pull off this feat, on everything from instrumentation to black hole theory. My ambition for the future is that we use artificial intelligence and machine-learning methods to design better scientists, who tell us how to go and discover the world around us. Sinéad Burke After recounting not being able to reach the locks on toilet doors in a candid speech in 2017, Sinéad Burke quickly became one of the world's most influential disability activists. Calling for all design to be more accessible, she has challenged some of the biggest names in the fashion industry - including Anna Wintour - to make clothing more inclusive. This year she became the first little person to appear on the cover of Vogue, and is launching her first podcast, aimed at challenging us to confront our biases and feel empowered to impact the world. As women move into positions that can create systemic change, we must be explicit in our refusal to repeat the cycles of oppression and exclusion that have been indelibly etched into our consciousness and beings. Our approach to redesigning the future must be intersectional. Lisa Campo-Engelstein Author of Contraceptive Justice: Why We Need a Male Pill, bioethicist Lisa Campo-Engelstein's work aims to improve women's lives through finding new methods of contraception. She also specialises in improving fertility for cancer survivors. A word after a word after a word is power. (Margaret Atwood) Scarlett Curtis Scarlett is co-founder of The Pink Protest, an online community of activists who supported the successful #FreePeriods campaign to get free menstrual products in schools in England. They have also helped push a bill through Parliament to make FGM part of the Children's Act. Scarlett's book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and other lies), brings together high-profile figures to talk about their experiences of mental health and the stigma surrounding the issue. Because the future will not be drawn without them. Ella Daish Delivering post in rural Wales, Ella was shocked by the amount of discarded plastic on the streets. So she started a campaign for plastic-free period products, successfully lobbying manufacturers to make real changes and councils to spend their period poverty funding on eco-friendly products. My hopes for the future are that period products come without plastic, governments make sustainable choices and manufacturers put the planet before profit. Sharan Dhaliwal British-Indian Sharan is founder and editor-in-chief of Burnt Roti magazine, focusing on mental and sexual health for young South Asians, and LGBTQ rights. Aided by crowdfunding, she published her first print issue in April 2016 and has since launched an online version. The platform hosted the Let's Talk About Sex workshop in London in 2018, to try to end stigma around being South Asian and sexually active. Our conversation around gender has become more visible and we're fighting for recognition of people who identify differently to how they were assigned at birth...It's hard to identify progress with hostile political climates governing our language and accessibility. Salwa Eid Naser Salwa Eid Naser stunned the field in the 400m final in Doha this year by running faster than any woman has done for more than three decades. The reigning 400m world champion was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, but moved to Bahrain at 14 seeking opportunities to further her running career. She now represents the Gulf State internationally. I don't fear nothing for the future because it is something I can handle when it comes. I really want to get it all - now I have the world gold medal, I want to keep going and get the Olympic gold medal. Rana El Kaliouby Rana el Kaliouby is a pioneer of artificial emotional intelligence, or Emotion AI. Her start-up Affectiva has developed software that can understand emotions by analysing facial expressions through a camera. The technology is being installed in vehicles to detect sleepy drivers. Also a passionate advocate for gender equity in tech and AI, Rana is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge and a post-doctorate from MIT. AI is at an inflection point: it's increasingly acting on our behalf, taking on roles traditionally held by people. As we plan for a future, we need to ensure that diversity of all kinds - gender, race, age, education and perspectives - are represented. Maria Fernanda Espinosa When Maria Fernanda Espinosa became president of the UN General Assembly, she became only the fourth woman to hold the position in the body's history - and the first from Latin America and the Caribbean. She has called on governments to put forward billions of dollars to tackle climate change, and announced her determination to fight gender discrimination. I envisage a future where efforts by the multilateral systems have led to the equal participation of men and women in politics, and to the protection of the rights of women who fight daily for jobs with equal conditions, and of women and girls who are the victims of violence. Lucinda Evans As South Africa faces rising rates of murder and rape against women and girls, Lucinda has emerged as a voice for women. She leads nationwide marches, rallying thousands of women in the streets of Cape Town, challenging government to translate policy into action. Lucinda founded Philisa Abafazi Bethu (Heal our Women), a non-profit organisation offering services including counselling, search committees for kidnapped girls and safe houses for women escaping domestic abuse. My hopes, as a Khoisan woman, are that we will one day be freed from violence against our bodies, and the bodies of our daughters, sisters, mothers and aunties. I hope that one day we will have a female president. For this, I will continue to advocate and rise in pain to power. Sister Gerard Fernandez Sister Gerard is a Roman Catholic nun in Singapore, who worked for three decades as a death row counsellor. Now 81, she has \"walked with\" 18 inmates before their deaths, describing her calling as helping \"people who are broken\". A female future, like any other, would be one filled with kindness, dignity and equality; a world without discrimination or hate, one that's driven by compassion. Bethany Firth Overcoming a fear of water after falling into an adult pool as a toddler, Bethany Firth burst onto the swimming scene at the London 2012 Paralympics. Bethany, who has learning disabilities, is now a four-time Paralympic gold medallist and multiple world record holder, and was Britain's most decorated athlete at the Rio 2016 Paralympics. This year she won two golds at the World Para-swimming Championships in London, and was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to swimming in 2017. In swimming I think we've already got good equality in the sport but I'm really pleased to see new innovations such as mixed relay events being included at major events like the World Championships and Paralympic Games and only increasing opportunities to compete on the same stage. Owl Fisher Owl - aka Ugla Stefanía Kristjönudóttir Jónsdóttir - is a journalist, writer and trans campaigner. They are the co-director of My Genderation, a film project focusing on trans lives and trans experiences. They also work with All About Trans, a project creating positive representation of transgender people in the media. They co-wrote the Trans Teen Survival Guide, to help empower transgender and non-binary teens. The future must move beyond the oppressive binaries of sex and gender - otherwise we will never truly break free and deconstruct the systems that have kept us complacent for so long. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce After storming to victory in 10.71 seconds at the women's 100m final in Doha in September 2019, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce now boasts more 100m world championship titles than Usain Bolt. It makes the Jamaican track and field sprinter the oldest woman to ever win an Olympic or world 100m title - and the first mum to do so since 1995. She carried son Zyon, two, on her lap of honour, saying she wanted to \"inspire women thinking of starting a family\". Finding balance is never easy but we as women get to decide. I never limit myself as to what is possible as long as my body will cooperate. It's important for the future of athletics that women continue to challenge themselves. I am excited to see just how far I can go, even at this stage of my career. Zarifa Ghafari At 26, Zarifa Ghafari is one of Afghanistan's first female mayors. The country's president appointed her mayor of Maidan Wardag, where support for the Taliban is widespread. She took the job despite it being too dangerous for her to live there - her office was mobbed by angry men on her first day. In the face of this adversity, she has taken to the streets with free rubbish bags as part of her clean city initiative, and says her goal is to make people believe in women's power. I'm the first female mayor for this war-torn province but I don't want to be the only one forever. I wish there were more women working alongside me in local government and leading departments and I am trying to make this a reality for other Afghan women. Jalila Haider Human rights lawyer Jalila specialises in defending women's rights in Pakistan, and provides free legal services to women in poverty. She is founder of We the Humans, a non-profit organisation working with local communities to provide opportunities for vulnerable women and children. She is the first female lawyer from the persecuted Hazara community, and in 2018 she went on hunger strike demanding protection for her people. Looking back into the past leads to the realisation that the entire politics of conflict, war and destruction is interconnected with Patriarchy. This is the time now that the world should accept the future as female; [women] are the symbol of peace, fertility, creation and coexistence. Let the women lead. Tayla Harris Tayla Harris is an Australian rules footballer playing for Carlton Football Club in the AFL Women's league, and a professional boxer. Since a photo of her kicking a ball during a match attracted misogynistic comments in March, a bronze statue of her has been unveiled in Melbourne's Federation Square, immortalising the kick in Australian sporting history. She also holds an unbeaten professional boxing record. A tattoo on my right arm reads 'fortune favours the brave'. I got this when I had my first professional boxing fight and moved away from family and friends to live in Melbourne and since this milestone, I've been fortunate to experience things I never would have thought possible. Hollie Hollie is a survivor of sex trafficking from Columbus, Ohio, US. She was first sold by her mother at the age of 15 and was enslaved through drug-use for 17 years. With the help of an innovative court programme called CATCH Court - which spots criminals who are actually victims - she was able to escape in 2015. Most women who are sex trafficked in the US are branded with tattoos or scars and she has since transformed the tattoos on her own body. She is working as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at a local Columbus court and is at the helm of Reaching For the Shining Starz – a non-profit organisation that helps victims of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking survivors are the most powerful, motivated, and compassionate group of people I've met in my lifetime. The ability to learn to trust, love, and forgive after we've been betrayed and badly abused – often by the people we loved – astonishes me. We genuinely are a resilient group that come back stronger than before. Huang Wensi Huang Wensi, 29, is one of a small but growing number of female boxers in China. Challenging traditional stereotypes of women's roles, she overcame postpartum depression to win the Asia Female Continental Super Flyweight Championship gold belt in 2018. She wants to continue to fight social stigma against women in sport. I want to prove that women have the power to move the world. I hope more women are not just defined by their family, but their dream, too. Luchita Hurtado This year, artist Luchita Hurtado landed her first solo show in a public gallery - at the age of 98. Born in Venezuela, and wife of influential artist Lee Mullican, she spent years treating her art as a private diary, before some 1,200 of her works were unearthed while curators were clearing out her late husband's studio. Hurtado's environmental advocacy continues to inform the visual language of her work. We should think before we vote Yumi Ishikawa Tired of the pain she suffered wearing heels eight hours a day at work, Yumi decided to vent her frustration on Twitter. Within days, Japan's #kutoo movement was born, with thousands of women sharing stories about being forced to wear heels to work as part of their uniform. Yumi gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures which she presented to the government over the issue. We're still in the situation where lots of people don't even realise there's gender discrimination in Japan, and for the #KuToo campaign too, lots of people don't regard it as an issue of discrimination. I hope people notice this kind of discrimination in our daily lives, and realise men and women are equal. Asmaa James Through a career in journalism and community social work, Asmaa has become the voice of Sierra Leone's voiceless. After learning of the rape of a five-year-old girl, she used her media platform to launch the Black Tuesday campaign, which encouraged women to wear black on the last Tuesday of each month to protest over the increase in the rape and abuse of girls under 12. The movement prompted presidential action to reform sexual violence policies. To all the women out there - we will find ourselves in male-dominated professions. Take the opportunity to stay on and persist. This is how the future holds more of us as leaders. Aranya Johar Aranya uses beat poetry to address issues like gender equality, mental health and body positivity. Her performance of A Brown Girl's Guide to Beauty has been viewed over three million times on YouTube. If women joined the workforce the global GDP could increase by $28 trillion. Why are we limiting half of the world's population and their potential? What could a gender equal world look like? And how far are we from it? Katrina Johnston-Zimmerman Katrina Johnston-Zimmerman is an urban anthropologist, working to make cities better places to live in. She co-founded The Women Led Cities Initiative, which aims to bring women's voices to the forefront of urban planning and design. The future of our cities is female because it has to be. Without a greater level of diversity, through women's input and impact on our urban environments, we are at an impasse for the future of these, our manufactured habitats. Gada Kadoda Dr Gada Kadoda helps women in remote areas use solar power to bring electricity to their villages by training them as community engineers. She was named a Unicef innovator to watch as the driving force behind Sudan's first innovation lab, giving students a space for collaborative working and problem-solving. She is founder of the Sudanese Knowledge Society, which gives young researchers the opportunity to freely interact with scientists and scholars from inside and outside the country. Women's urgent futures depend on mastering liberation tools to enrich our options. Amy Karle Born with a rare condition which left her with missing skin, Amy Karle grew up fascinated by the possibility of what the human body could be capable of with the right technology. Now an award-winning bioartist, her work includes a human hand design made with 3D-printed scaffolds and stem cells. Biotechnology can lead us into a very promising future or irreversible demise. It is of vital importance that we thoroughly and thoughtfully contemplate the range of dangers and potentials and work together to establish strategies to utilise our technology for the best and highest good of humanity. Ahlam Khudr Self-proclaimed 'mother of all Sudanese martyrs', Ahlam's 17-year-old son was killed in a peaceful protest in 2013. Since then, Ahlam has dedicated her life to seeking justice for him, and fighting for the rights of those killed or 'disappeared' in Sudan. She was part of underground forums and protests and was \"brutally beaten\" when caught by security forces. In the movement that started in December 2018 against then-President Omar al-Bashir, Ahlam became a prominent protester, leading rallies with strong ties to the youth on the ground. Sudan will become again an important and powerful country. The young Sudanese have learned about their rights. Once they have become aware of what rights they are entitled to, they will never accept to abandon them. Fiona Kolbinger In 2019, cancer researcher Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman ever to win the Transcontinental Race - one of the world's toughest cycling races. Covering 4,000 km in 10 days - from Bulgaria to France - she beat off 264 competitors, the majority of which were male. I hope that one day, nobody will be underestimated because of gender, age, ethnicity or educational background any more – creating a respectful society that promotes confidence and gives equal chances to everybody. Hiyori Kon Hiyori Kon, 21, is a sumo wrestling prodigy in a country where women are still barred from competing professionally. She was the subject of the 2018 award-winning documentary Little Miss Sumo, which charted her battle to change the rules of one of the world's oldest sports, and give a voice to women in sumo. I would like to give the opportunity for children all over the world to get involved with sumo, and make sumo an Olympic sport. Aïssata Lam Aïssata Lam set up the Youth Chamber of Commerce of Mauritania to support young women entrepreneurs struggling to access funding for their start-ups. She is a vocal advocate for women's rights, using her platform to honour exceptional Mauritanian women, and was appointed to the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council by French President Emmanuel Macron. The time is coming when women's voices cannot be silenced, nor ignored. The time is coming when women's equal participation in today's most pressing issues is necessary. The time is coming when women's seat at the table is non-negotiable. This time is now. Soo Jung Lee Forensic psychology professor Soo Jung Lee has worked on numerous high-profile murder cases in South Korea. Based at Kyonggi University in Seoul, she has challenged the legal system, helping introduce an anti-stalking bill. She believes stalking leads to more serious crimes in many cases, where the majority of the victims are vulnerable women. As a forensic psychologist, I want the future to be a safe place for my children. Fei-Fei Li Fei-Fei Li arrived in the US from China at 16 with no English language skills, working part-time in her parents' dry-cleaning business. Now widely credited as a pioneer of artificial intelligence, the former Google vice president co-directs Stanford's institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), which is looking at how to develop ethical AI. Li is co-founder of AI4ALL, which is focused on recruiting more women and minorities to build AI. We are on the cusp of the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This new era has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity, but it will bring with it challenges and opportunities we can't yet foresee. My hope is that we will bring more voices, more views, and more expertise to the discussion. Erika Lust An award-winning independent adult filmmaker exploring how women can help shape the future of porn. She has also written a guide for parents on how to talk to their children about porn. Pornography isn't going anywhere; if we take action now, we can decide what happens next. Lauren Mahon Nominated for BBC 100 Women list by Jameela Jamil and the I Weigh community, Lauren Mahon is one third of the powerhouse trio \"kicking cancer's arse\" on BBC 5 Live's podcast You, Me & The Big C. The campaigner has set up online community Girl vs Cancer to provide young women with information on cancer charities, news on the nuances of treatments and tips for what to buy a bestie with cancer. My hope for the future is that every single female-identifying or non-binary human on the planet stands in their power and purpose. This is how we're going to change the world. Julie Makani Julie is from Tanzania, one of five countries in the world with the highest estimated number Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) births annually. She has dedicated the past two decades to research on treatment for the disease and working to influence health policies so that individuals across Africa can access vital diagnostic tests and medicines. She is trying to establish life-changing interventions including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, a medicine with strong effects on the bone marrow— a step towards the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease. Now she is researching a cure using gene therapy. Sickle cell disease research in Tanzania will have a significant impact in raising awareness about a disease that affects many people in Africa and the achievements made to improve healthcare. Lisa Mandemaker Lisa Mandemaker is leading the team building a prototype artificial womb, in collaboration with the Máxima Medical Centre in Holland. It is hoped the wombs will replace incubators for babies within the next 10 years. Social designer Lisa sees design as a tool for debate, to challenge assumptions, question or excite. The beginning of life slowly becomes a domain that we can design, and everyone should be part of the discussion on how we design this. Jamie Margolin At 16, Jamie co-founded the Zero Hour movement, using social media to organise the first youth climate change marches in 25 cities, including Washington DC. She has since testified before the US Congress alongside Greta Thunberg. The future must be decolonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished. Climate change is a man-made problem, which is why women should rule the world. Francia Marquez A formidable leader of the Afro-Colombian community, Francia Márquez spearheaded a 10-day, 350-mile women's march to the country's capital, to take back their ancestral land from illegal gold miners. After 22 days of protests on the streets, the Colombian government agreed to stem illegal mining in the mountainous region of La Toma. The human rights and environmental activist has faced death threats over her actions, which won her the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. My hope is that human consciousness is being raised to understand that we are not masters of nature, we are part of it, and so we must take care of it, in the same way that it takes care of us. Gina Martin After being upskirted at a music festival, Gina Martin launched a campaign to make upskirting illegal in England and Wales. The law was changed this year after an 18-month legal fight. Four men have been convicted under the new legislation so far. Prosecutors say all of the victims were \"simply going about their business on public transport, shopping or attending events when they were targeted\". I spend my time wondering what society would look like if we cared about the things that don't directly affect us. My hope is that, in my lifetime, I get to see that. Sarah Martins Da Silva Sarah is one of Scotland's leading gynaecologists. As a senior lecturer in reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, she has focused on solving male infertility, to try to stop women being subjected to unnecessary and invasive fertility treatments. I hope that we can harness science, technology, investment and innovation in male reproductive health to redress global inequalities and the current burden of fertility on women. Raja Meziane Singer Raja Meziane's political music video Allo le Système! has been viewed more than 35 million times on YouTube. Her anti-government songs tackling social injustice, alleged corruption and inequality have seen her forced into exile from Algeria. Now based in Prague, she is a vocal supporter of Algeria's protests in 2019, which have seen tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets calling for change. To those who oppose us, we say, 'Strike the woman, and you strike the rock'. (Winnie Mandela) Susmita Mohanty Hailed as 'India's space woman', spaceship designer Susmita founded India's first space start-up. A passionate climate action advocate, she uses her business to help monitor and understand climate change from space. I fear that in three to four generations our home planet will not be very habitable anymore. I hope that humanity will wake up to a Greta-esque urgency for climate action. Benedicte Mundele When Benedicte looked around the Democratic Republic of Congo, she could see plenty of raw produce from potato to passionfruit, but still people were living in food poverty. She says supermarkets were full of products originally grown in DR Congo, but exported out, processed with preservatives, before being reimported at expensive prices. She founded Surprise Tropical, a food canteen serving healthy, takeaway food in the suburbs of the capital, Kinshasa. Five years on, the company's online business delivers fresh produce throughout the city. The future belongs to those who see the opportunities behind what others see as problems or frustrations. Subhalakshmi Nandi Based at the International Center for Research on Women, Subhalakshmi has spent over 15 years working to improve gender equality in Asia. Her focus is the rights of women farmers, ending violence against women and improving women's education. My hope for the future is that women will no longer be invisible and uncounted. Women themselves will be organised and will better articulate the work that they do to uphold the entire economy and society. Government data and policy will also respond to the reality of women's work, both paid and unpaid. Trang Nguyen Trang Nguyen grew up in Vietnam, confronted from a young age with monkeys chained up for sale on the streets and bears held to extract bile for traditional medicine. So she obtained a PhD in Biodiversity Management, and set up WildAct, a non-profit organisation which helps authorities monitor illegal wildlife trade markets. In 2018, it launched the country's first ever master's course in Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade, to help train the next generation of conservationists. People need to put aside their prejudices and work together to gain a better understanding of the issues of conservation and create solutions for the problems that will be effective and long lasting. For the future of nature conservation, it is important that women's voices are heard and their actions are recognised. Van Thi Nguyen Van is co-founder of the Will to Live Center, which provides training for disabled people in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. Her aim is to create an equal working environment for all. She also runs social enterprise Imagator, which employs 80 people, half of whom have a disability. I wish the environment in Vietnam enabled people with talent and devotion to develop, instead of people feeling like they need to move abroad to use their skills. Natasha Noel Natasha is a yogini, a female master practitioner of yoga and wellness coach. The body positivity influencer often opens up about her traumatic childhood on social media, after losing her mother at the age of three and being the victim of child abuse. My hopes for the future are that we live in an empowered world for every human being. Equal opportunities and equal basic liberties...everyone working to improve their emotional intelligence and their intelligence quotient. So empathic and consciously aware humans are created. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez This year, aged 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She grew up in the Bronx and volunteered as a campaigner in the 2016 Presidential elections. Against all the odds, she defeated a veteran congressman in the June 2018 primaries, and has since been dubbed the future of the Democratic party. Her trademark look is no accident – she chose red lipstick and hoops for her swearing in ceremony so that “next time someone tells Bronx girls to take off their hoops, they can just say they're dressing like a Congresswoman.” We are fighting for a future where no person is left behind. When people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we've got to ask them, ‘Why does that make you so uncomfortable?' Because it's not just about identity, this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice. Farida Osman Nicknamed 'the golden fish', in 2017 Farida became the first woman in Egypt to win a medal when she claimed bronze in the 50m butterfly at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. She won another bronze this year. She gives lectures at universities to inspire the younger generation to pursue swimming, and is training to fulfill her ambition of winning a medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. My hope for the future is to have more female athletes excel at their sport in order to represent Egypt well internationally. I want them to believe in their dreams and do whatever it takes until it becomes a reality. Ashcharya Peiris Ashcharya Peiris was on her way home from work at a bank in Sri Lanka when a bomb blast left her blind in 2000. She lost her job to her disability, but ended up fulfilling her dream of becoming a fashion designer by describing her designs to a seamstress. She was a finalist in Sri Lanka's Up & Coming Fashion Designer competition, and is now a motivational speaker in garment factories, inspiring young women to follow their own dreams. Trials and tribulations in life are nothing but disguised blessings that empower you to achieve your goals. Danit Peleg Fashion designer Danit once found herself at a conference with nothing to wear, so quickly designed a skirt on her laptop and 3D-printed it. She wants all women to have the same option. Her entirely 3D-printed collection has been showcased by Vogue and US supermodel Tyra Banks. In the future, I hope technology improves, and women will be able to choose sustainable but still fashionable garments when they get dressed in the morning. Autumn Peltier Autumn Peltier has been campaigning for clean drinking water for indigenous people in Canada since she was just eight years old. This year, at 14, she was named Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, taking on the role from her great-aunt Josephine Mandamin. One day I will be an ancestor, and I want my great-grandchildren to know I advocated for them so they can have clean drinking water and have a future. Swietenia Puspa Lestari Swietenia founded the Divers Clean Action Foundation to clear marine debris in Indonesia. They now have 1,500 volunteers working across the island nation and South East Asia. She also initiated the #nostrawmovement campaign in the country, which saw the reduction of single-use plastic straws in more than 700 restaurants. Youth are the agents of change, and create change faster, whilst women are the agents in each household, who will make eco-friendly decisions for future generations. Megan Rapinoe Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the US Women's National Team. She led the team to victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup, scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. She was named Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. Megan is a vocal advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game. If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me. Onjali Rauf Onjali Rauf was recovering from life-saving surgery when the idea for her first book came to her. Inspired by a real-life meeting between herself and a refugee mother in Calais, The Boy at the Back of the Class is a child's perspective on the refugee crisis and won the Waterstones Children's Book Prize 2019. She is also founder of Making Herstory, which seeks to end the abuse, enslavement and trafficking of women and girls in the UK and beyond. The future for us women seems both a beautiful and a precarious thing. Beautiful because in so many ways, untold stories of just how much women have been sacrificed at the altar of male progression are finally seeing the light of day. But the advancements are fragile too – with outright misogynists and abusers still in seats of power and women still battling wars that our great-grandmothers were battling too. Charlene Ren As a graduate student, Charlene Ren created MyH2O, a solution to the lack of clean drinking water in rural China. Now her non-profit platform has created a nationwide water information mapping network, training locals and students to do their own testing so water organisations know where to take action and which communities are in need. The gender ratios are extremely biased in the NGO sector - significantly more women have chosen to serve in a sector that receives minimal funding, resources and acknowledgement yet [they] strive to create a better and inclusive future. Maria Ressa Maria Ressa is an award-winning journalist from the Philippines who set up website Rappler to expose fake news. She has received rape and death threats online for being an outspoken critic of President Duterte's violent war on drugs, and has been arrested twice this year accused of 'cyber libel'. Ms Ressa is being represented by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. For the next generation, the battle is going to be the battle for truth. What's happening to us in the Philippines isn't unique – we are just the canary in the coal mine. You have to shine the light, you have to speak, you have to say what is happening. Djamila Ribeiro Writer Djamila Ribeiro is one of the most influential figures in the Afro-Brazilian women's rights movement. Her work focuses on themes including black feminism, racism, and female empowerment. She is founder of the Sueli Carneiro's Seal initiative, which publishes black writers' works at affordable prices. To think about the future, first it's necessary to recognise past mistakes. Only by facing colonialism and its consequences, will it be possible to co-exist with dignity Jawahir Roble Jawahir Roble is the UK's first Muslim, black, female, hijab-wearing referee. Having come to the UK from Somalia at the age of ten, she discovered a passion for sports which led her to become a referee. She now studies football coaching and management, hoping to complete her degree in 2020. I have two dreams: one day to referee in the Women's World Cup Final and to get as many girls as possible playing football. I urge more women to participate and take up refereeing Najat Saliba Professor Saliba is conducting world-leading research on polluted air. She grew up on her family's farm in rural Lebanon, but when civil war prompted a move to the city, she was awakened to the disturbing realities of air pollution. After watching relatives, friends and colleagues develop health complications as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the environment, she hopes her innovative work with a Beirut university will make it possible to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges. Like the positive and negative dipoles defining a chemical bond, and the yin and the yang staging the balance in nature, women and men must co-reign to solve our current and future environmental threats. Nanjira Sambuli Nanjira leads the World Wide Web Foundation in its bid to increase digital equality. She looks for solutions to ensure nobody is left behind when it comes to web access, whether disadvantaged by gender or geography. My hope is that we see it happen more and more, and not only when women are 'given' positions to fulfil diversity quotas or clean up messes. We have a ways to go for 'The Female Future' to unleash its true potential to heal the world. Zehra Sayers Biophysicist Zehra Sayers has been hailed as a beacon of hope for the Middle East (Nature journal) for her success in her contribution to bringing scientists from eight Middle Eastern countries together. During her 15-year tenure as chair of the Science Advisory Committee of SESAME project, she worked with a group of scientists including those from Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Cyprus, under the same roof to found a CERN-like laboratory. She shared the prestigious 2019 Award for Science Diplomacy for the feat. I am very happy to see young female scientists at SESAME today, either as staff members or as users. I believe that SESAME provides several opportunities for women from the Middle East to make their research more visible and their voice better heard. Hayfa Sdiri At 16, Hayfa founded not-for-profit Entrcrush, an online platform for future entrepreneurs where they could be matched with donors, and take e-courses in areas like management and accounting. She works with the UN in Tunisia on gender equality initiatives. One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I want to; I will earn as much as a man. Noor Shaker Computer scientist Noor Shaker left Syria for Europe in 2008 to follow her passion for Artificial Intelligence. After a successful decade in academia, she turned her skills toward entrepreneurial innovation. Motivated by her mother's fight against cancer, Shaker was compelled to bring her knowledge of AI to the medical world. The result is a ground-breaking technique using AI to design new medicines faster than humans. Her work has attracted the attention of some of the top global pharmaceutical companies, and she has been named one of MIT's 'Innovators under 35'. Algorithms can now autonomously improve and provide augmented capabilities for innovation in ways never possible before. This will empower the next generations with tools for early detection and prevention of deadly diseases leading to longer and healthier lives. Bonita Sharma Inspired by her mum's determination to obtain a degree despite pressure to become a housewife, Bonita Sharma helps educate and empower women and girls in her native Nepal. In a bid to tackle child deaths to malnutrition, she designed Nutribeads, a bracelet for new mums with different coloured beads to remind them what to feed their babies. Her projects have been awarded funding from the UNESCO Malala Fund, and she has founded her own organisation to empower women and girls: The Social Changemakers and Innovators. There are people in the world who are facing the devastating consequences of inequality in health, education and nutrition right now, and there are women and girls who are working relentlessly to change this status quo. I hope every woman and girl will have an opportunity to reach their full potential in life without any discrimination. Vandana Shiva In the 1970s, she was part of a movement of women who threw their arms around trees to prevent them being felled - the original 'tree-huggers'. Now a world-renowned environmental leader and winner of the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize, the 'ecofeminist' sees women as the custodians of nature. I hope that women will lead a transition away from catastrophe and collapse, and sow the seeds of our common future. Pragati Singh When qualified doctor Pragati Singh started researching asexuality, she received messages from women who didn't want to have sex but were facing an arranged marriage. So she began organising meet-ups for people looking for non-sexual relationships. She now runs Indian Aces, an online community for asexual people. It's time we try increasingly inculcating *feminine* characteristics in our feminism - less 'strong', more 'empathetic'. Lyubov Sobol Lawyer Lyubov Sobol investigates alleged corruption in Russia, documenting her work through social media and a YouTube channel with over a million subscribers. She and other opposition candidates were banned from standing in local elections in Moscow this summer, sparking demonstrations by tens of thousands of young people. To be honest, I don't really think about the future. We live in an unpredictable country. Anything can happen here. But in some long-term perspective I do believe that we will win. We will defend our country. Russia will be free and happy. Samah Subay Samah is a lawyer who has worked tirelessly in difficult circumstances since the war in Yemen started in 2015. She provides legal support to families whose children have 'disappeared'. This year her team at Mwatana for Human Rights managed to reunite some of these families, though she continues to advocate for the release and education of many more children still in detention. The time will come when people will be convinced in the pointlessness of wars. Then change will come, including legislative changes in terms of the rights of women specifically and Yemeni people in general. Kalista Sy Self-taught screenwriter Kalista Sy's TV series Mistress of a Married Man sent shock waves through her home country when it was released earlier this year. Dubbed 'Senegal's Sex and the City', the viral sensation features sexually liberated, hard-working and successful female characters who address the struggles of women in West Africa, from polygamy to domestic abuse and mental health issues. Despite everything that women go through, despite all the mistakes they had to make, despite all the 'you can't do this', they know they can rise up, and be the best version of themselves - because the future will not be drawn without them. Bella Thorne This summer, 22-year-old actress and director Bella Thorne released her own topless photos after a hacker threatened to leak them, saying, “It's my decision now, you don't get to take another thing from me.” Bella, who has just directed her first porn film, says the abuse of women online can only change if more female content creators are involved in projects that celebrate sexuality. The female future for me is finally having equality. Women feel this pressure to say 'yes', like it's instinctual. I think that the female future is finally not having to do that anymore. Veronique Thouvenot Veronique Thouvenot leads the Zero Mothers Die initiative. It aims to save the lives of pregnant women and their babies through tech, providing women with mobile phones and health information by text. It is run by the Millennia2025 Foundation, of which Dr. Thouvenot is co-founder and scientific director. Help save women's lives with Zero Mothers Die! Greta Thunberg In August 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thurnberg skipped school to protest outside the Swedish parliament. What started as a one-person strike has since spread to a worldwide protest over climate change. Her actions have mobilised activists across the world, with millions of young people taking part in Fridays for Future. This year, she travelled by solar-powered boat from Europe to the United States - an epic journey undertaken to encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint. She has also opened up about her diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome, saying \"given the right circumstances, being different can be a superpower\".

The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - the Female Future - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final 100 were chosen.

    "text": "Zhanna Nemtsova told the BBC she believed the Russian president was \"politically\" to blame. Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and veteran liberal politician, was shot dead on 27 February while walking with his girlfriend near the Kremlin. President Putin has condemned the murder and vowed to find the killers. Meanwhile, one of the men charged over the murder has said he was forced into a confession. Zaur Dadayev told prison visitors that he was tied up for two days with a bag on his head, and only confessed to the killing so that a friend would be freed. 'Everybody is frightened' Speaking to the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse, Ms Nemtsova echoed previous claims made by her father's allies that his killing was politically motivated. \"He was the most prominent critic of Putin. He was the most powerful leader of the opposition of Russia,\" she said. \"After his death the opposition is beheaded and everybody is frightened,\" she added. \"Now we do not have any other figure so powerful... with so much expertise and experience to confront the officials.\" The 30-year-old, who is a stock market analyst and TV presenter at a financial channel in Moscow, said she had not been contacted by Russian investigators because they were \"not interested in an independent investigation\". Officials have yet to cite a motive for Mr Nemtsov's murder. Last year, he contacted the Russian authorities after receiving death threats on his Facebook page, which he linked to his position on the conflict in Ukraine. He had been drafting a report expected to expose covert Russian military involvement in the conflict. Police turned down his request for an investigation in September. Ms Nemtsov said she had not been able to access her father's apartment where he kept his files. Speaking about the moment she learned of the 55-year-old's death, she said: \"I couldn't believe it, I still can't believe it. \"They have killed my father, I cannot keep silent.\" The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, has called for a \"full and transparent\" investigation into the murder. The European parliament is expected to adopt a resolution condemning the killing and the state of democracy in Russia later on Thursday. 'Torture' On Sunday, a court in Moscow said Zaur Dadayev, who was charged alongside fellow Chechen Anzor Gubashev, had admitted involvement in the shooting on a bridge. But a member of Russia's human rights council, who visited the suspects in prison on Tuesday, said there were \"reasons to believe Zaur Dadayev confessed under torture\". Andrei Babushkin said Mr Dadayev had shown him marks from handcuffs and ropes around his legs, and told him he had been tortured with electricity. The suspects Nemtsov murder: The suspects He called for \"people not involved in the investigation\" to look into the claim. Three other men, including Mr Gubashev's brother Shagid, are being held in connection with the case. Russia's investigative committee said Mr Babushkin and a journalist accompanying him had been allowed to visit the prison to inspect the confinement conditions. But they went beyond their remit by inquiring about the criminal case, violating \"not only the established norms, but the law,\" a statement said. Both Mr Babushkin and journalist Eva Merkacheva would be questioned by investigators, the committee said. People close to Mr Nemtsov have cast doubt on suggestions he might have been targeted because he had defended the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. They said he was not prominent critic of radical Islamism and focused his criticism on President Putin. You can watch the full BBC2 Newsnight interview on BBC iPlayer.",

    "text": "A joint statement said Iran was doing so in good faith to resolve outstanding issues related to nuclear safeguards. The agreement came during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA's director general. The global watchdog has criticised Iran for not answering its questions about possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at the two locations, and denying it access. It is thought the activities took place long before 2015, when Iran struck a landmark deal with world powers that placed limits on its nuclear programme. Iran insists it has never sought nuclear weapons, but evidence previously collected by the IAEA suggests that until 2003 it conducted \"a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device\". What has been agreed? IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi flew to Tehran on Monday for consultations with the head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi. On Wednesday, they announced they had \"reached an agreement on the resolution of the safeguards implementation issues specified by the IAEA, in good faith\". \"In this regard, Iran is voluntarily providing the IAEA with access to the two locations specified by the IAEA and facilitating the IAEA verification activities to resolve these issues,\" it added. \"Dates for the IAEA access and the verification activities have been agreed.\" The statement said that in the present context, the IAEA did not have further questions for Iran or further requests for access to locations. What do we know about the sites? The IAEA is tasked with certifying Iran's declarations under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and facilitating an Additional Protocol that Iran agreed to implement in 2015. In its latest report on the safeguards agreement, published in June, the IAEA expressed concern about: At the start of this year, the IAEA asked Iran to provide access to the second and third locations so that inspectors could carry out environmental sampling. The agency believed there would be no value in obtaining access to the first location. The report said Iran had responded by saying it was unable to provide access to the sites and that it would \"not recognise any allegation on past activities\".",

    "text": "Apec members said in a statement that the purpose of the agreement, proposed by China, was to deny safe haven to anyone engaged in corruption. It comes amid efforts by Chinese President Xi Jinping to clamp down on corrupt officials, including those who try to escape abroad. Apec leaders are expected to back the deal at a summit in Beijing next week. US Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the move as a \"major step forward\". \"Corruption not only creates an unfair playing field, it not only distorts economic relationships, but corruption also steals from the people of every country the belief that the system can work for everybody,\" he told journalists. Extradition concerns The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) group statement said it had set up the Network of Anti-Corruption Authorities and Law Enforcement Agencies (ACT-NET). The network commits its 21 member states to \"deny safe haven to those engaged in corruption, including through extradition, mutual legal assistance and the recovery and return of proceeds of corruption\". It will also \"establish measures and systems to protect whistleblowers\". Officials say that the proposal was initiated by China and backed by the US. But correspondents say it is not clear how the agreement will work between countries that do not have bilateral extradition treaties. The US, Canada and Australia - all seen as friendly to Chinese emigrants - have no extradition treaties with China because of concerns about capital punishment and the alleged use of torture in the Chinese judicial system. China is currently involved in a huge campaign to root out corruption at all levels of society. More than 13,000 Chinese officials were found guilty of corruption and bribery in the first nine months of 2014 alone. This year saw the launch of Operation Fox Hunt, widening the scope of the campaign to include officials who have fled abroad. President Xi has warned that the campaign would target both \"tigers\" and \"flies\", indicating that no-one, even senior party members, was exempt from the crackdown. Since he came to power, some of China's biggest political heavyweights, including the vice-chairman of China's parliament and the former security chief have been targeted.",

    "text": "Fighting raged for several hours after the jails - Abu Ghraib to the west of the capital and Taji to the north - came under attack. Mortar fire and suicide bombs were used to gain access to the jails, whose inmates include al-Qaeda prisoners. At least 20 members of the security forces were killed as they struggled to regain control. A senior Iraqi MP, Hakim Al-Zamili, said that about 500 prisoners had escaped from the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. Most of them were senior members of al-Qaeda who had been sentenced to death, he told Reuters news agency. \"It's obviously a terrorist attack carried out by al-Qaeda to free convicted terrorists with al-Qaeda,\" the agency quoted an unnamed security official as saying. Abu Ghraib was used to torture opponents of the regime during Saddam Hussein's rule, and its infamy increased in 2004 when photographs were published showing detainees being abused by US guards. Mortar rounds The prison attacks were launched at about 21:30 (18:30 GMT) on Sunday night. Gunmen fired mortar rounds at the prisons, and then used car bombs at the entrances. The situation was eventually brought back under control on Monday morning, with the use of military helicopters. Iraqi authorities initially denied any prisoners had escaped in the attacks, but now acknowledge \"some\" prisoners escaped. Interior Minister Wissam al-Firaiji said the attackers, whom he called \"terrorists,\" had been well-armed. \"The attack against Taji jail alone was carried out by nine suicide bombers and three car bombs driven by suicide bombers,\" he told reporters. \"The attackers also lobbed more than 100 mortar shells,\" he added. \"The inmates are now under control.\" Northern flashpoint Elsewhere in Iraq, two attacks on security forces in the northern city of Mosul killed 33 people, officials said. A man drove a vehicle packed with explosives up to a military convoy. \"A suicide bomber was following the convoy and when it stopped in the middle of road he detonated his vehicle right behind it,\" a policeman told Reuters news agency. A group of soldiers and at least two passers-by were among the dead, officials said. A second attack was launched on a group of policemen, several of whom were killed when gunmen stormed their checkpoint. Mosul, 360km (220 miles) north-west of Baghdad, is one of Iraq's major flashpoints. Insurgent groups such as al-Qaeda have found the city a fertile recruiting ground. It is the capital of the Sunni-dominated Nineveh province. There were further deadly attacks in the city of Kirkuk and in Anbar province, according to Agence France Press. Violence up It is unclear who was behind the incidents, but there has been a recent escalation in violence across Iraq. United Nations figures released earlier in July showed that more than 2,500 Iraqis were killed in violent attacks in the three months from April to June. The current spate of attacks makes this the most dangerous time in Iraq since the peak of the anti-US insurgency in 2006-7, and certainly since the US withdrawal in 2011. Some of the country's minority Sunni population feel increasingly marginalised by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's Shia-led government. Shia forces have targeted Sunni protesters, and insurgents linked to al-Qaeda and its \"Islamic State in Iraq\" have been carrying out bomb attacks on government institutions and Shia population centres. The spark in violence has raised fears of a return to the levels of sectarian killing seen following the US invasion ten years ago, and has led commentators to discuss once again the prospect of partition along community lines. The conflict in neighbouring Syria, itself increasingly taking the form of a Sunni-Shia sectarian conflict, is further straining community relations in Iraq. Militants have previously targeted Iraqi prisons in similar operations, though Sunday night's breakout appears to be far larger in scale than previous incidents. Prisons themselves have been a focus for Sunni grievances, with protesters saying inmates have been unfairly detained and in some cases tortured. Al-Qaeda's affiliated group in Iraq has previously said it would target the justice system, AFP reports.",

The attacks in Mumbai damaged peace efforts between India and Pakistan. The bailing of Mr Lakhvi came a day after Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif vowed to end terrorism after the Taliban killed 141 people at a school in Peshawar. Correspondents say the move will be an embarrassment for the Pakistani authorities who are under pressure to bring suspects in the case to justice. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and his co-accused were arrested in 2008 and had filed bail applications on 10 December. It remains unclear on what grounds the court ordered Mr Lakhvi's bail. The attacks in Mumbai were blamed on the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Mr Lakhvi was accused of heading the group. Another man, Zarar Shah, has been accused of working with him, and was arrested in Pakistani-administered Kashmir in December 2008, but his name does not appear alongside those being tried with Mr Lakhvi. Nine other men have been also charged in absentia in relation to the attacks. Mr Lakhvi was directed to pay surety bonds worth 1m rupees ($15,800; £10,100) before being released, his lawyer told Reuters. The lawyer, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, told the PTI news agency that bail had been granted because the \"evidence against Lakhvi was deficient\". Prosecutors are considering whether to challenge the ruling. India, which provided intelligence intercepts which it said proved Laskhar-e Taiba's involvement in the attack, was swift to criticise Mr Lakhvi's release. Home Minister Rajnath Singh described the granting of bail as \"very unfortunate\". He said: \"I believe it should not have happened... [The] Pakistan government must appeal against the order at the earliest.\" Correspondents say the charges brought against Mr Lakhvi and other suspects held in Pakistan were mainly based on a confession given by the only gunman captured alive after the attacks.

Australian Peter Greste was deported back to Australia earlier this year and was on trial again in absentia. The three are accused of aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood group but they strenuously deny the allegations. The three journalists were originally sentenced in July 2014, with Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy receiving seven years and Mr Mohamed getting 10 years. But their convictions were overturned in January this year and they were freed in February to await retrial. Giving the verdict on Saturday, judge Hassan Farid said the three men were not registered journalists and had been operating from a Cairo hotel without a licence.

    "text": "Individuals are allowed to take out only €60 (£42; $66) a day for this period, although they can bank online more freely, so they can pay their bills online. They cannot move money to accounts abroad. The move follows the European Central Bank's announcement that there would be no increase in emergency funding for Greece, and lending would be kept at the level set on Friday. We take a look at what this actually means: What are capital controls? A government can use capital controls to order its banks to impose strict limits on daily withdrawals and overseas transfers of cash. It can also impose other measures such as limiting foreign exchange transactions. In this case, it would be to prevent euros flowing out of Greek banks - to overseas banks, into a different currency, or even simply to be stashed under the mattress. Until now, the Greek government had been signalling that it did not want to introduce such restrictions. However, because the ECB's cash pipeline is frozen, the government has little choice. I'm on holiday in Greece, what about me? Credit and bank cards issued abroad can be used at cash machines freely - subject to queues and the amount of cash in them - so that visitors can continue to contribute to Greece's vital tourist industry. In any case, their money is not coming out of a Greek bank ultimately, but their own national bank account. What are the restrictions imposed in Greece? Has any other eurozone nation had to introduce capital controls? Only Cyprus, where capital controls were imposed on Cypriot banks in 2013 after a banking crisis and a subsequent bailout deal with the EU and IMF. There, though, the limits were far higher, with daily withdrawals capped at €300 of cash per person per day. Cypriots travelling abroad could take no more than €1,000 out of the country, while payments and/or transfers outside Cyprus via debit and/or credit cards was permitted only up to €5,000 per month. Businesses could carry out transactions up to just €5,000 per day, and a special committee was created to review commercial transactions between €5,000 and €200,000. That committee also had to approve all commercial transactions over €200,000 on a case-by-case basis. And the cashing of cheques was banned. How long can capital controls remain in place? There's no standard period. The general assumption with such emergency capital controls is that once the economic dust has settled, the panic withdrawals will end and the controls can be lifted again. The longer they are in place, however, the greater effect they have on an economy. A tightening on business transactions and withdrawals of deposits could in turn affect sectors such as retail sales and tourism, and the commercial activity and industry of a country as a whole. In Cyprus, controls remained in place for a long time. The last restrictions were not lifted until April 2015, after more than two years. Are Greece's controls legal? All such moves fly in the face of the founding treaties of the European Union and the eurozone, which declare that money should be free to flow throughout the entire single currency area. Indeed, one of the main reasons for European monetary union was to enable such free flows of money. In Cyprus, the European Commission only allowed the introduction of the controls because it said there was significant risk \"of complete destabilisation\" of the financial sector. The EC has also given its permission for Greece to impose these controls, saying it appears justified in breaching EU laws. Its Financial Services Commission said in a statement: \"In the current circumstances, the stability of the financial and banking system in Greece constitutes a matter of overriding public interest and public policy that would appear to justify the imposition of temporary restrictions on capital flows.\" It added, though, that the free movement of capital would need to be reinstated as soon as possible.",

    "text": "The rights group said the amputation, carried out at a prison in the northern province of Mazandaran, was \"an abhorrent form of torture\". Iranian officials said the man was found guilty of 28 cases of theft. Iran's Islamic penal code says theft \"on the first occasion\" is punishable by the amputation of four fingers of the right hand. Iranian authorities have defended amputation as the best way to deter theft despite protests by international human rights organisations. However, reports of such punishments are rare. Saleh Higazi, Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on Thursday that the premeditated \"maiming and mutilation of individuals is not justice\". \"It is a harrowing assault against human dignity. Reforms to Iran's penal code that would put an end to this outrageous practice are long overdue.\" The Iranian judiciary's news agency Mizan said the sentence had been carried out on Wednesday in the capital of Mazandaran, Sari. The convicted man was not named. Iran is an Islamic republic and its legal system is based on a strict reading of Sharia law. In January 2018 authorities in north-eastern Iran amputated the hand of a 34-year-old man convicted of stealing sheep. Similar punishments have been meted out in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Somalia. Iranian authorities were widely criticised by rights groups last year for flogging a man who was convicted of consuming alcohol as a teenager more than 10 years earlier. In February this year the US and human rights groups expressed anger after Iran executed two teenage boys for rape. Amnesty said at the time that Iran had executed nearly 100 juvenile offenders since 1990 - the highest number of any nation.",

    "text": "Actress Rose McGowan told the BBC \"this is a great day\", while others said the ruling brought hope to victims that their voices would be heard. Weinstein, 67, was convicted in New York City of third-degree rape and a first-degree criminal sexual act. He was cleared of the most serious count of predatory sexual assault. Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison over the guilty verdicts relating to two women. His lawyers say he will appeal. \"I'm innocent. How can this happen in America?\" Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala quoted his client as saying. The former movie executive still faces charges in Los Angeles of assaulting two women in 2013. In all, at least 80 women had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek. Most of those complaints, however, have not led to criminal charges, as they are beyond the statute of limitations - meaning they happened too long ago. The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that prompted women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. Weinstein once enjoyed phenomenal success with Oscar winners such as Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting, The King's Speech and Shakespeare in Love. He was taken to New York's Bellevue Hospital reportedly suffering from chest pains after the verdict was announced. He had been due to be moved to prison on Riker's Island to await sentencing. What happened in the New York court? The jury of seven men and five women reached their verdict on Monday morning, the fifth day of deliberations. Weinstein - who denied all charges - was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The judge ordered him to be sent to jail immediately. But the jury acquitted him on two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence, and first-degree rape of Mann. In the minutes after the verdict, Weinstein showed no emotion as he talked to his lead lawyer Donna Rotunno. A third-degree rape charge in New York is defined as engaging in sexual intercourse with a person who is incapable of consent, or under age 17, or who has not given consent for a reason other than the inability to consent. Prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who used his position of power in Hollywood to manipulate and attack women. The defence team said sex between the movie executive and the accusers was consensual, and that the accusers used it to advance their careers. The allegations amounted to \"regret renamed as rape\", the defence said. Two of the accusers kept in contact with Weinstein and had sex with him after the alleged attacks, they pointed out. How did we get here? What were the allegations in this case? Ms Haleyi, who had worked on one of Weinstein's television productions, said she was assaulted by the producer after he invited her to his Lower Manhattan home. She testified that he backed her into a bedroom, held her down on the bed and forced himself on her. Ms Mann said that she found herself in an \"extremely degrading\" relationship with him that did not involve intercourse until he raped her in a New York City hotel room in 2013. She said he was a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" figure who could be charming in public but showed his dark side when they were alone. Another one of Weinstein's accusers, Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra, told jurors he raped her in her apartment one night in the mid-1990s. Her allegation was too old to be charged as a separate crime, but prosecutors used it in an attempt to demonstrate that the accused was a repeat sexual offender. Following the verdict, Ms Sciorra said: \"I spoke for myself and with the strength of the 80-plus victims of Harvey Weinstein in my heart.\" Three other also women testified they were lured to apparent work meetings with Weinstein, then sexually assaulted. What more reaction has there been? Rose McGowan told the BBC's Newshour programme: \"The little girl I was when I was hurt, she's ecstatic...This is a great day. The trash has been taken out.\" The actress, who was an early Weinstein accuser, added: \"The fact that we are white women and attractive and of some means and it still took this many of us to even get him to have one day in court - just tells you…how almost impossible it is to even be heard, period, let alone [get] any kind of conviction.\" In a joint letter, actresses Ashley Judd, Lucia Evans and Rosanna Arquette and 19 other Weinstein accusers called it \"disappointing that today's outcome does not deliver the true, full justice that so many women deserve,\" but expressed gratitude towards all the women who came forward to speak out against him. Meanwhile, Ms Rotunno said that \"the fight is not over\". \"Harvey is unbelievably strong. He took it like a man and he knows we will continue to fight for him and he knows that this is not over.\" Ms Rotunno said her client was disappointed, but \"mentally tough\". What happens next?",

    "text": "By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News Advertisements displayed by the sites, which are visited by millions every day, were found to be installing harmful files without users' knowledge. Researcher Conrad Longmore found that two popular sites - xhamster and pornhub - posed the greatest risk. Pornhub contested the findings, saying they \"grossly exaggerate\" the risk. 'Sudden spike' Mr Longmore said it was primarily Windows users at risk, but that criminals were increasingly turning their attentions to mobile devices. While none of the porn sites observed hosted any malware themselves, it was the embedded advertisements within their pages that created problems for users. \"We call these malicious advertisements 'malvertising',\" explained Mr Longmore. \"The way the ads are bought and sold across all websites is incredibly complex. \"Ads can often be repackaged and resold so that it is hard to tell where they originated from, and the criminals behind them go to great lengths to disguise what they are doing.\" Mr Longmore compiled his figures using Google's diagnostic advice service, which regularly analyses websites for harmful content. The data showed that xhamster - listed by monitoring firm Alexa as the 46th most popular site on the internet - had malvertising on 1,067 out of 20,986 pages (5%) screened in the past 90 days. According to Alexa's statistics, the average user of xhamster would look at 10.3 individual pages - meaning a potential 42% risk of stumbling across harmful adverts in each viewing session. Another site, pornhub, was found to have dangerous advertising on 12.7% of the 14016 pages scanned in the 90 day period. In a statement, pornhub owner Manwin said its figures suggest a tiny percentage, 0.003%, of the billions of ads it served during the 90-day period potentially carried malware. \"Isolated incidents of malware are immediately caught, and minute when considering the mammoth amount of traffic our site receives,\" said Manwin. It added that it analysed adverts before they went live and also while on the site to ensure they stayed free of malware. Site study Mr Longmore said: \"There seems to have been a sudden spike in malware on popular sites, especially in the past week or so. \" He added that in a similar study 12 months ago, the web's most popular porn site, xvideos, was serving up malware via banner advertising. However, in the more recent research, the site was not found to have any harmful adverts in the time sampled by Google's system - a sign the site had \"cleaned up\". Mr Longmore believes a culture of users being afraid to \"kick up a fuss\" meant many instances of malvertising go unreported. \"Part of the problem is that porn is a taboo subject,\" he said. \"But the reality is that these are hugely popular sites with many of them in the top 100 most popular sites globally. Some of them pull in more traffic than the BBC, so this is potentially a very big issue. \"Site operators could put a quick reporting mechanism on their sites to flag up bad ads and other concerns, and ad networks should also take some responsibility here. \"I don't see that happening any time soon, and perhaps the best thing that users of these sites can do is ensure that their machines are up to date.\" The BBC has approached the owner of xhamster but has yet to receive any comment.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent No idea, says Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts. \"Either you are doing a clinical trial or not\". Clinical trials - a three-phased process - determine whether the vaccine induces good immune responses and whether it causes any unacceptable side-effects. On Sunday, India's drug regulator gave emergency approval of a locally produced coronavirus vaccine, called Covaxin, before the completion of trials. The government-backed vaccine has been developed by Bharat Biotech, a 24-year-old vaccine maker, which has a portfolio of 16 vaccines and exports to 123 countries. The regulator said the vaccine had been approved for \"restricted use in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, especially in the context of infection by mutant strains\". (The regulator also approved the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being produced in India.) This, despite the fact that the key third phase of Covaxin's clinical trials - the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety - was underway. Assurances by the regulator that the vaccine is \"safe and provides a robust immune response\" have not placated most scientists and health experts. All India Drug Action Network, a watchdog, said it was \"baffled to understand the scientific logic\" to approve \"an incompletely studied vaccine\". Bharat Biotech says it has a stockpile of 20 million doses of Covaxin, and is aiming to make 700 million doses out of its four facilities in two cities by the end of the year. \"Our vaccine is 200% safe,\" says Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of the firm. Dr Ella has defended the approval. For one, he said, Indian clinical trial laws allowed \"accelerated\" authorisation for use of drugs after the second phase of trials for \"unmet medical needs of serious and life-threatening diseases in the country\". The fact that his vaccine was based on an inactivated form of coronavirus - a reliable and time-tested platform - also helped. Studies on monkeys and hamsters had shown that Covaxin provided ample protection against the infection, Dr Ella said. Nearly 24,000 of the 26,000 volunteers had already participated in the ongoing third phase trials, and the firm was expected to have the efficacy data for the vaccine by February, he added. Scientists are sceptical. \"Since there is no data for the third phase of trials, we don't know how efficacious this vaccine is. We know it is safe, going by the limited phase two trials. What if we roll out a vaccine with unknown efficacy and later find it to be only 50% efficacious? Would it be fair to people who received it?\" Dr Shahid Jameel, a leading virologist, told me. It is still not clear what the regulator meant by saying that the vaccine would be administered in a \"clinical trial mode\". In a conventional trial, volunteers are not told whether they are given the vaccine or a placebo, and many are excluded from participating because of pre-existing health conditions. Dr Ella said his firm will monitor the recipients after they've taken Covaxin jabs. This is likely to add to the logistics of the vaccination programme. So did the regulator actually mean Covaxin would be administered to people in a \"fourth phase of clinical trials\" for ongoing studies after the vaccine is approved and marketed? \"Give us some time to understand the whole thing. We don't know whether this will be treated as a trial,\" Dr Ella said. That's not all. A senior member of the federal Covid-19 taskforce muddied the waters further by saying that Covaxin would be \"like a back-up [vaccine]\" in the event of a sharp spike in cases. Epidemiologists I spoke to say they are baffled. \"Does it mean that in the event of a surge, some people will be given a vaccine of unproven efficacy?\" a senior epidemiologist said. However, Prof Paul Griffin, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Queensland, says it is not unheard of vaccines to be used in emergency circumstances in a targeted way whilst still under a clinical trial framework. This is usually considered if the ongoing trials are robust and if the data from earlier trials supports the vaccine's expanded use \"both in terms of safety as well as efficacy\", he told me. With more than 10 million coronavirus infections, India has the second highest number of reported cases after the US. The pandemic has battered its economy. India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people between January and July. But the rollout is also happening at a time when cases have slowed down considerably. Bharat Biotech is a well-known vaccine maker, with a track record of clinical trials in 20 countries, involving more than 700,000 volunteers. So why could India not wait for a few weeks more for the final trials to be over and approved a vaccine of proven efficacy? Why this haste? \"It is incomprehensible,\" Shashi Tharoor, a senior opposition politician and MP, told me. Mr Tharoor blames this \"unseemly haste\" on Narendra Modi's BJP government \"which enjoys placing slogans over substance\". In this case, he says, \"chest-thumping 'vaccine nationalism' - combined with the PM's \"self-reliant India\" campaigning - trumped common sense and a generation of established scientific protocols\". Others say \"poor science communication\" and a lack of transparency by regulatory officials had also contributed to this fiasco. India is a vaccine-making powerhouse, making 60% of the world's vaccines. It runs the world's largest immunisation programme targeting 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women - who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year. The Covaxin fiasco holds many lessons for India. As the virus devises ways to grow more infectious, a number of vaccines may be needed to counter it and prevent severe disease among infected people. \"Approval for all vaccines must be provided on the basis of adequate evidence of efficacy and safety. Clarity on tested and approved doses and dosing schedules too is needed in that context,\" K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told me. \"It is in the interest of science and public confidence that all concerns related to any vaccine are adequately addressed. We cannot win this battle if we doubt the weapons that are being handed to us,\" he added.",

    "text": "The actress, known simply as Sridevi, died of a heart attack on Saturday while at a family wedding in Dubai. Over five decades, she featured in almost 300 films, including classics Mr India, Chandni, ChaalBaaz and Sadma. She was considered one of the very few Indian female superstars capable of huge box office success without the support of a male hero. Top Bollywood figures, sporting giants and leading politicians reacted with shock, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"saddened\" by her death. Crowds gathered outside Sridevi's home in Mumbai as news emerged. A spokesperson for Sridevi's husband, who is the producer Boney Kapoor, told the Indian news agency Asian News International that her body would be flown from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday. What has the reaction been to Sridevi's death? Why was she such a huge box office draw? Sridevi worked in films in the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi languages. Her acting career began at the age of four and by 13 she was cast in the adult role of a complicated woman avenging her lover's death. Sridevi debuted as a lead actress in a Bollywood film in 1978, soon becoming one of India's biggest film stars. The actress decided to take a break from the film industry after the release of Judaai in 1997. She made a comeback in 2012, starring in English Vinglish. In 2013, the Indian government awarded her the Padma Shri - the fourth highest civilian honour. How did she die? The actress was in the United Arab Emirates to attend the wedding of her nephew, Mohit Marwah. Her husband and daughter, Khushi, were with her when she passed away on Saturday, reports say. Her brother-in-law, Sanjay Kapoor, said it had happened at about 23:00 local time (19:00 GMT), according to news site The Indian Express. He did not provide any further details.",

    "text": "The group, which runs the camp where the teenager has been living, confirmed the death on Friday. The baby died of pneumonia, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was \"tragic and deeply distressing for the family\". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would \"continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones\". Ms Begum left the UK in 2015 with two friends and was found in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She wanted to return to Britain but was stripped of her citizenship. Her husband, a Dutch IS fighter called Yago Riedijk, is being held at a nearby prison and has been informed of the baby's death. A paramedic working for the Kurdish Red Crescent in the camp told the BBC that the baby, called Jarrah, had been suffering from breathing difficulties. He was taken to a doctor on Thursday morning before being transferred to hospital, along with his mother, but died at 13:30 local time that day, the medical worker added. Ms Begum has since returned to the camp and her child was buried there yesterday. 'Nothing but sympathy' Speaking to the BBC before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. \"I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone.\" Ms Begum, 19, gave birth to her son last month, shortly after being tracked down by a journalist in a Syrian refugee camp. She had reportedly left Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children and named her newborn son Jarrah after her firstborn. As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. Mr Javid previously said that the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her son, explaining: \"Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child.\" The lawyer representing the family of Ms Begum, Tasnime Akunjee, also confirmed the death. In an interview with the BBC after the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She also said that she never sought to be an IS \"poster girl\" and simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship, her family wrote to the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Akunjee tweeted a screenshot of the reply that they had received from the Home Office. It told them that the possibility of bringing the baby to the UK was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that they would need permission from Ms Begum. The FCO is obliged to consider requests for consular assistance, the letter added. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been \"politically difficult\". \"The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. \"Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps if there was a political will.\" 'We've failed as a country' Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: \"We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. \"This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen. The family reached out to the Home Office, requested help, the Home Office sent a reply saying you've come to the wrong department. \"There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation.\" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office. She tweeted: \"It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane.\" Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said \"all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such\". She added: \"It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria.\"",

    "text": "Turkey has reacted with anger to the comment made by the Pope at a service in Rome earlier on Sunday. Armenia and many historians say up to 1.5 million Armenian Christians were killed by Ottoman forces in 1915. But Turkey has always disputed that figure and said the deaths were part of a civil conflict triggered by WW1. The row has continued to sour relations between Armenia and Turkey. 'Bleeding wound' The Pope made the comments at a Mass in the Armenian Catholic rite at Peter's Basilica, attended by the Armenian president and church leaders. He said that humanity had lived through \"three massive and unprecedented tragedies\" in the last century. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th Century', struck your own Armenian people,\" he said, in a form of words used by a declaration by Pope John Paul II in 2001. Pope Francis also referred to the crimes \"perpetrated by Nazism and Stalinism\" and said other genocides had followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Burundi and Bosnia. He said it was his duty to honour the memories of those who were killed. \"Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it,\" the Pope added. Armenia's President Serzh Sargsyan welcomed his comments, saying they sent a powerful message to the international community. But Turkey immediately summoned the Vatican's ambassador to Ankara for an explanation, and then later recalled its ambassador from Rome. The foreign ministry said it felt \"great disappointment and sadness\" at the Pope's remarks, which it said would cause a \"problem of trust\" between them. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted: \"The Pope's statement, which is far from the legal and historical reality, cannot be accepted. \"Religious authorities are not the places to incite resentment and hatred with baseless allegations,\" he added. Analysis: David Willey, BBC News, Rome Pope Francis, who visited Turkey last year, would have been perfectly conscious that he would offend the moderate Muslim country by his use of the word \"genocide\". But the Pope's powerful phrase \"concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to bleed without bandaging it\" extended his condemnation to all other, more recent, mass killings. It now remains to be seen how far his remarks will impact upon the Vatican's future relations with moderate Muslim states. It was a bold decision but totally coherent with Pope Francis' philosophy of open discussion about moral arguments. Pope Francis' focus today on Armenia, the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion, even before the conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine, serves as yet another reminder of the Catholic Church's widely spread roots in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 'Political conflict' In 2014, for the first time, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences to the grandchildren of all the Armenians who lost their lives. But he also said that it was inadmissible for Armenia to turn the issue \"into a matter of political conflict\". Armenia says up to 1.5 million people died in 1915-16 as the Ottoman Empire was disintegrating. Turkey has said the number of deaths was much smaller. Many of the victims were civilians deported en masse to barren desert regions where they died of starvation and thirst. Thousands also died in massacres. Most non-Turkish scholars of the events regard them as genocide. Among the other states which formally recognise them as genocide are Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and Uruguay. Turkey maintains that many of the dead were killed in clashes during World War One, and that ethnic Turks also suffered in the conflict.",

    "text": "By Akbar HossainBBC Bengali About 1,600 refugees were being transported on Friday towards Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, Reuters reported. Bangladesh says all those being moved have given consent. But Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh told the BBC in October they did not want to be relocated to the island. Rights groups have raised concerns that many travelling to the island on Friday were being moved against their will. Human Rights Watch said it had interviewed 12 families whose names were on transport lists but who had not volunteered to go. The United Nations said it had been given \"limited information\" about the relocations and was not involved. Bangladesh's foreign minister Abdul Momen said on Thursday night that the government \"was not taking anyone to Bhasan Char forcibly. We maintain this position\". The Rohingya have fled Myanmar after a military crackdown which began three years ago in which UN investigators say as many as 10,000 people were killed and more than 730,000 forcibly displaced. Hundreds of thousands have since lived in Cox's Bazar, a sprawling refugee camp inside neighbouring Bangladesh. Rashida Khatun, 55, told the BBC in October that her children were among an initial 300 refugees sent to Bhasan Char against their will earlier this year after spending several months at sea attempting to flee Bangladesh. When BBC reporters visited the island in October, they were denied access to the refugees already living there. On Thursday, a 31-year-old man told Reuters tearfully by phone as he boarded a bus from Cox's Bazar: \"They have taken us here forcefully. Three days ago, when I heard that my family is on the list, I ran away from the block, but yesterday I was caught and taken here.\" Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the relocation was voluntary. \"They are going there happily. No-one is forced. The government has taken all measures to deal with disasters, including their comfortable living and livelihood,\" he said. Bangladeshi authorities have been building on the island for three years, at a cost of $350m (£270m). Their aim is to relocate more than 100,000 refugees in order to ease tensions within the camps inside Bangladesh. Earlier this year, Amnesty International released a damning report on the conditions faced by the 306 Rohingya already living on the island. The report contained allegations of cramped and unhygienic living conditions, limited food and healthcare facilities, a lack of phones in order for refugees to be able to contact their families, as well as cases of sexual harassment by both the Navy and local labourers engaging in extortion. Commodore Abdullah al Mamum Chowdhury, a spokesman for the Navy, denied the charges. \"We are taking care of them as our guests,\" he said. \"They are given proper food and access to all facilities.\"",

    "text": "Central bank data suggests there are more than six billion 100-bolivar notes in circulation, making up almost half of all currency. Venezuelans will have 10 days from Wednesday to exchange the notes for coins and new, higher-value bills. President Nicolas Maduro said the move would stop gangs hoarding the notes. But in India, a similar move to scrap high-value bank notes last month has caused major disruption. 'Mafia hoarding' In a surprise announcement, Mr Maduro said on Sunday that the 100-bolivar note, worth about 2 US cents (£0.015) on the black market, would be taken out of circulation on Wednesday. The president said the aim was to tackle transnational gangs which hoard the Venezuelan notes abroad, a move he has in the past described as part of the \"economic war\" being waged against his government. He said the gangs held more than 300bn bolivares worth of currency, most of it in 100-bolivar notes. President Maduro said there were \"entire warehouses full of 100-bolivar notes in the [Colombian cities of] Cucuta, Cartagena, Maicao and Buaramanga\". Border closure He said part of the plan was to block any of the 100-bolivar notes from being taken back into the country so the gangs would be unable to exchange their hoarded bills, making them worthless. \"I have given the orders to close all land, maritime and air possibilities so those bills taken out can't be returned and they're stuck with their fraud abroad,\" he said speaking on television. Venezuela's currency has fallen dramatically amid skyrocketing inflation. On the black market, its value dropped by 55% against the US dollar just in the past month, and the International Monetary Fund estimates that next year's prices will rise by more than 2,000%. Gangs can therefore buy up Venezuelan banknotes cheaply on the black market in exchange for dollars or Colombian pesos. They then use the Venezuelan currency to buy subsidised goods in Venezuela, which they in turn sell at a profit in neighbouring Colombia. Many Venezuelans living near the border buy Colombian pesos to purchase goods in Colombia which they cannot get in Venezuela due to chronic shortages. Cash crunch? President Maduro blames both the shortages and Venezuela's record inflation on \"imperialist forces\" he says are trying to bring down his government. He said the aim of these \"forces\" was \"to destabilise out economy and our society, to leave the country without 100-bolivar notes\". Analysts say the move is likely to worsen the cash crunch in Venezuela, where people have already been limited in the amount of cash they can take out at automated teller machines. Venezuelans have only been given 10 days to exchange their 100-bolivar notes for new coins and bills ranging from 500 to 20,000 bolivars due to be introduced from 15 December. Critics of Mr Maduro have predicted chaos and doubt that the facilities will be in place for people to exchange all their 100-bolivar notes. \"When ineptitude governs! Who would possibly think of doing something like this in December amid all our problems?\" opposition leader Henrique Capriles wrote on Twitter (in Spanish).",

    "text": "By Sarah FinleyBusiness reporter When Shahzad Younas took to the stage he was very nervous. It was two years ago, and the then 32-year-old British entrepreneur was in San Francisco pitching London-based Muzmatch to a group of high profile potential investors. He opened his address to the room by saying: \"Muslims don't date, we marry.\" Shahzad and his business partner Ryan Brodie were there because they had entered a global competition to win backing from prestigious Silicon Valley investment firm Y Combinator. This US company offers financial and practical support to a number of new start-ups per year. More than 13,000 applied at the same time as Muzmatch, and it was one of 800 whose founders were invited to pitch in person. As Shahzad continued his speech, the investors were soon bursting into laughter at how frank he was. Muzmatch was quickly given $1.75m (£1.3m), one of 100 start-ups that got backing in 2017. Today the fast-growing company says it currently has more than one million registered users across the UK and some 90 other countries. Rewind to 2013 and it wasn't a group of investors that Shahzad had to convince, it was himself. Back then he was working for a bank in the City of London. He enjoyed his job, but at the same time he increasingly realised that there was a gap in the market for a decent dating app aimed at Muslims who were looking for a partner from within their religious community. \"At the time there were either these really basic websites for Muslims, or big dating apps that didn't quite get our culture,\" says Shahzad, who was born and bred in Manchester. \"In the Muslim community a lot of us did, and still do, rely on matchmakers [to find a wife or husband]. These are 'aunties' in the community who know families, and who would match up a son with another family's daughter.\" His idea for Muzmatch was that it would be a digital matchmaker app for Muslims who wanted to find someone to marry. In 2014, Shahzad decided that he had to make a go of the app and quit his job. \"I'd wake up at 6am every morning and go to bed at about one or 2am,\" he says. \" I was working from my bedroom at home, and it was intense. I had to learn how to build an app from scratch. \"But I knew I had to make it work. The opportunity was big enough - there are 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, and clearly no one was serving them.\" Shahzad did a soft launch of the app in 2015, and his marketing methods were somewhat different to the bigger dating apps. \"I'd go to big mosques after Friday prayers and hand out cards for the app,\" he says. \"Then I'd go to any kind of family Muslim event that I knew was on, and I would literally stick them under windscreens.\" Watching a business grow on your own can be hard, and at the beginning Shahzad said he found it excruciating. \"I remember the first couple of months I would constantly look at Google Analytics, which would show me in real time how many people were on the app,\" he says. One time he says he checked, and there were just 10 people on Muzmatch. But over time user numbers grew into thousands, thanks mainly to positive word of mouth. Soon people started telling Shahzad how they had met their wives or husbands. \"Once I heard the first success story it made it feel real,\" he says. \"And it cemented in me that the app was going somewhere.\" More The Boss features: Business partner Ryan, a seasoned app builder despite still being just 25 years old, came on board in 2016. Together they completely redesigned Muzmatch, with feedback from their early customers. They added in 22 more profile questions that people were asking for, such as how religious a person is, and how often they pray - things that really mattered to their users. Muzmatch also allows users to opt out of having a profile photo, or to blur it instead. People can also tick a box whereby transcriptions of their in-app chats are sent to one of their parents, or to another chosen guardian. Shahzad says that while Ryan is not a fellow Muslim, he really \"gets what the app is about\". Eden Blackman, founder of dating website and app Would Like to Meet, says that Muzmatch has been at the forefront of more specialised dating apps. \"In recent years ethnic and religious dating has moved from a niche to a mainstream platform, and what Muzmatch is doing leads the pack,\" he says. \"If religion and online dating can be matched perfectly... it should be on hallowed ground. From what I have seen and heard about Muzmatch they seem to have broken the mould.\" Muzmatch, which also has a small team in Bangladesh, operates a \"freemium\" business model. It is free to use its basic service, but you can pay from £10 a month for extra features such as unlimited viewing of profiles, and having your own profile seen by more people. The company says its annual turnover is now more than £4.5m. As the app continues to grow in popularity, Shahzad says that its potential users are the estimated 400 million single Muslims around the world. \"We've now had thousands of marriages and babies [thanks to Muzmatch],\" he says. \"Thinking about them every day makes me feel like all that hard work at the beginning was worth it.\"",

    "text": "He was viewed by his subjects as a stabilising influence in a country that saw numerous military coups during his reign. Despite being seen as a benign father figure who remained above politics, he also intervened at times of heightened political tension. And although he was a constitutional monarch with limited powers, most Thais regarded him as semi-divine. Bhumibol Adulyadej was born in Cambridge in the US state of Massachusetts on 5 December 1927. His father, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, was studying at Harvard when his son was born. The family later returned to Thailand, where his father died when he was just two years old. His mother then moved to Switzerland, where the young prince was educated. As a young man he enjoyed cultured pursuits, including photography, playing and composing songs for the saxophone, painting and writing. The status of the Thai monarchy had been in decline since the abolition of its absolute rule in 1932, and there was a further blow when his uncle, King Prajadhipok, abdicated in 1935. The throne passed to Bhumibol's brother, Ananda, who was just nine years old. Figurehead In 1946, King Ananda died in what remains an unexplained shooting accident at his palace in Bangkok. Bhumibol acceded to the throne when he was 18 years old. His early years as king saw Thailand ruled by a regent, as he returned to his studies in Switzerland. While on a visit to Paris he met his future wife, Sirikit, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France. The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before the new monarch was crowned in Bangkok. For the first seven years of his reign, Thailand was ruled as a military dictatorship and the monarch was little more than a figurehead. In September 1957, Gen Sarit Dhanarajata seized power. The king issued a proclamation naming Sarit, military defender of the capital. Under Sarit's dictatorship, Bhumibol set about revitalising the monarchy. He embarked on a series of tours in the provinces, and lent his name to a number of developments, particularly in agriculture. For his part, Sarit reinstated the custom that people crawled on their hands and knees in front of the monarch. and restored a number of royal ceremonial occasions that had fallen into disuse. Overthrow Bhumibol dramatically intervened in Thai politics in 1973 when pro-democracy demonstrators were fired on by soldiers. The protesters were allowed to shelter in the palace, a move which led to the collapse of the administration of then-prime minister, Gen Thanom Kittikachorn. But the king failed to prevent the lynching of left-wing students by paramilitary vigilantes three years later, at a time when the monarchy feared the growth of communist sympathies after the end of the Vietnam War. There were to be further attempts to overthrow the government. In 1981, the king stood up to a group of army officers who had staged a coup against then prime minister, Prem Tinsulanond. The rebels succeeded in occupying Bangkok until units loyal to the king retook it. However, the tendency of the king to side with the government in power caused some Thais to question his impartiality. Bhumibol intervened again in 1992, when dozens of demonstrators were shot after protesting against an attempt by a former coup leader, Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, to become prime minister. The king called Suchinda, and the pro-democracy leader, Chamlong Srimuang, to appear in front of him, both on their knees as demanded by royal protocol. Suchinda resigned and subsequent elections saw the return of a democratic, civilian government. During the crisis that erupted over the leadership of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, the king was frequently asked to intervene but insisted this would be inappropriate. However, his influence was still viewed as pivotal when the election Mr Thaksin had won that April, was annulled by the courts. Mr Thaksin was eventually deposed in a bloodless coup, in which the military pledged their allegiance to the king. In the years that followed, the king's name and image were invoked by factions both for and against Mr Thaksin, as they jostled for power. The entire country joined lavish celebrations to mark King Bhumibol's 80th birthday in 2008, reflecting his unique status in Thai society. Reverence Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power in a coup in May 2014 and was made prime minister by the military-appointed parliament a few months later. He promised far-reaching political reforms to prevent a return to the instability of recent years. But critics suspected his real priority was to destroy the party of Mr Thaksin and to ensure that the royal succession took place smoothly. The public reverence for King Bhumibol was genuine but it was also carefully nurtured by a formidable public relations machine at the palace. There were harsh \"lese-majeste\" laws that punished any criticism of the monarchy and which restricted the ability of foreign and domestic media to fully report on the king. During his long reign, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was faced with a country continually racked by political upheaval. It said much for his skills as a diplomat, and his ability to reach out to ordinary people in Thailand, that his death leaves the country's monarchy far stronger than it was at his accession.",

    "text": "Jalaluddin Haqqani was a significant militant figure in Afghanistan and had close ties to both the Taliban and al-Qaeda. His son is believed to have taken over control of the group in 2001. The Haqqani network has been behind many of the co-ordinated attacks on Afghan and Nato forces in recent years. There were no details in the statement about the date or place of Haqqani's death. \"Just as he endured great hardships for the religion of Allah during his youth and health, he also endured long illness during his later years,\" a statement from the Afghan Taliban said. Rumours about Haqqani's death have circulated for years. In 2015, sources close to the group told the BBC that the leader had died at least a year earlier. This was never confirmed. CIA 'prized asset' Jalaluddin Haqqani was an Afghan guerrilla leader who fought Soviet troops when they occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s. US officials have admitted that at the time he was a prized asset of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). However, he later allied himself to the Taliban after they took power in Afghanistan in 1996. In its statement, the Taliban called Jalaluddin Haqqani an \"exemplary warrior... and among the great distinguished jihadi personalities of this era\". The Haqqani network was one of several militant groups that operated from the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, which ousted the Taliban in 2001. The group, which it is alleged largely operates from Pakistan, has also been blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan, including a truck bomb explosion in Kabul in 2017 that killed more than 150 people. Symbolic loss for militants Mahfouze Zubaide, BBC News, Kabul Jalaluddin Haqqani may not have been playing a significant operational or strategic role at the time of his death, but his loss is still significant for the militant group he founded. Although he was no longer a key player - having ceded control to his son Sirajuddin Haqqani some years ago - it is widely believed that he still played an advisory role, and his death will be a huge emotional loss for the group. The Haqqani network currently remains among the most powerful and feared militant groups in Afghanistan - some say it has more clout than other outfits such as the Islamic State group. Haqqani militants have been blamed for numerous deadly terror attacks in the country, including last year's suicide truck blast in the capital. It is significant that the Taliban have chosen to emphasise that he died of \"natural causes\" and after a long illness. This seems to be a direct reference to multiple rumours of his death earlier.",

    "text": "By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website The rotorcraft will visit dozens of promising locations on Titan to investigate the chemistry that could lead to life. Titan plays host to many of the chemical processes that could have sparked biology on the early Earth. The eight-rotor drone will be launched to the Saturnian moon in 2026 and arrive in 2034. It will take advantage of Titan's thick atmosphere to fly to different sites of interest. Dragonfly was selected as the next mission in Nasa's New Frontiers programme of medium-class planetary science missions. It was in competition with the Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return (CAESAR) mission, which would have delivered a sample from a comet to Earth. Titan is second only in size to Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, and has its own seasonal cycle, where wind and rain have shaped the surface to form river channels, seas, dunes and shorelines. The average temperature of -179C (-290F) means that mountains are made of ice, and liquid methane assumes many of the roles played by water on Earth. Dragonfly will first land at the \"Shangri-La\" dune fields, which are similar to the linear dunes found in Namibia in southern Africa. The drone will explore this region in short flights, building up to a series of longer \"leapfrog\" flights of up to 8km (5 miles), stopping along the way to take samples. \"Flying on Titan is actually easier than flying on Earth,\" said the mission's principal investigator Dr Elizabeth \"Zibi\" Turtle, from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. \"The atmosphere is four times denser at the surface than the atmosphere at the surface of Earth and the gravity is about one-seventh of the gravity here on Earth.\" She added: \"It's the best way to travel and the best way to go long distances so that we can make measurements in a variety of different geologic environments.\" It will finally reach the Selk impact crater, where there is evidence of past liquid water and organics - the complex carbon-based molecules that are vital for life. These may have existed together for tens of thousands of years. \"What really excites me about this mission is that Titan has all of the key ingredients needed for life,\" said Dr Lori Glaze, the director of planetary science at Nasa. \"Liquid water and liquid methane. We have the complex organic carbon-based molecules. And we have the energy that we know is required for life. \"So we have on Titan opportunity to observe the processes that were present on early Earth when life began to form and possibly even conditions that may be able to harbour life today.\" In addition to studying this \"pre-biotic chemistry\", Dragonfly carries instruments that can investigate the moon's atmosphere and the water-ammonia ocean thought to lie beneath its surface. It will also search for chemical evidence of past or present life. \"With the Dragonfly mission, Nasa will once again do what no-one else can do,\" said the US space agency's administrator, Jim Bridenstine. \"Visiting this mysterious ocean world could revolutionise what we know about life in the Universe. This cutting-edge mission would have been unthinkable even just a few years ago, but we're now ready for Dragonfly's amazing flight.\" The lander could eventually fly more than 175km (108 miles) - nearly double the distance travelled to date by all Mars rovers combined. Dragonfly will be powered by a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which converts the heat released by the decay of a radioactive material into electricity. While there is enough sunlight at Titan's surface to see, there is not enough to use solar power efficiently. Follow Paul on Twitter.",

The defects coincided with a spike in Zika infections, leading experts to suspect the mosquito-borne virus. Research has now affirmed those experts' suspicions, the CDC said. \"This study marks a turning point in the Zika outbreak. It is now clear that the virus causes microcephaly,\" said Dr Tom Frieden, the head of the CDC. More on the Zika crisis: Microcephaly: Why it is not the end of the world What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect Abortion dilemma Laws and practices in Catholic Latin America On Monday, US health officials warned the Zika outbreak could have more of an effect on the United States and called for additional funding to combat the virus. \"Everything we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought,\" said Dr Anne Schuchat of the CDC. Zika virus was first diagnosed in 1947 in Uganda, but symptoms have typically been mild, including rash, joint pain and fever. The current outbreak started in 2015 in Brazil and the symptoms have been much more severe. Nearly 200 babies have died as result of the virus. Researchers are interesting learning why some cases of the virus result in birth defects while others do not. Some women who were infected with Zika while pregnant gave birth to apparently healthy children. There have been 346 confirmed cases of Zika in the continental United States, according to the CDC, all associated with travel. CDC officials said the findings do not change the agency's earlier guidance to pregnant women. The CDC has discouraged pregnant women from travelling to places where the Zika virus is spreading, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dr Frieden said intensive research was under way to find out much more about the mosquito-borne virus and to develop a vaccine for it, although he warned that that could still be years away. This is the first time that mosquito bites have caused birth defects, Dr Frieden said. The virus can be transmitted by sexual contact as well.",

    "text": "Ms Gandhi had said she would step down in the wake of a letter written by dissidents calling for sweeping reform. Following a seven-hour meeting of top officials, she agreed to stay on temporarily, with the party working to elect a new leader within six months. Congress ruled the country for decades, but has recently been routed in polls. This has led to sharp criticism of its leadership, which has long favoured the Gandhi family. The party was removed from power by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, managing to win just 44 seats in the 543-member house. That was the beginning of a massive decline which also saw it lose control of a number of states where it held power. The 2019 election did not see a revival of its fortunes. In fact, many political observers say, it cemented just how unpopular the Congress - known as India's grand old party - had become with voters. It is now in power in just six Indian states - in four of those, it governs as a member of a coalition. Analysts and political commentators have attributed much of the blame to lacklustre leadership and the inability of the party to look beyond the Gandhi family. One member or another has been at the helm since India won independence from the UK in 1947. After Monday's marathon meeting in Delhi, Ms Gandhi said: \"Congress is one big family and I don't hold anything against anyone. But all, especially senior leaders should raise concerns at the party forum only.\" NDTV quoted her as saying: \"I am hurt but they are my colleagues, bygones are bygones, let us work together.\" She was referring to a letter written by 23 senior leaders, which stirred up controversy as it was the first time that so many party members had acknowledged the need for decisive change. Political observers say that it has exposed a long-running battle between older and younger members of the party. The letter was reportedly written last week but became public on Sunday, when it was published in the Indian Express newspaper. In it, the leaders call for various reforms including an \"independent election authority\" and an \"institutional leadership mechanism to guide the party's revival\". Signatories include former ministers Kapil Sibal, Shashi Tharoor, Gulam Nabi Azad and Manish Tewari. Ms Gandhi reacted swiftly, and called for a new party president to be elected. She was full president for nearly 20 years, but took the post on again in an interim role a year ago after her son, Rahul, stepped down following the 2019 election loss. On Monday, the Congress party's highest decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee, decided to form a committee that would aid Ms Gandhi in the party's day-to-day operations. The party will also meet again within six months to detail the election of a new leader.",

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire called the rise \"deeply disappointing\". Figures also show 8.3m people were born abroad - 13% of the UK population - the first time the number has passed 8m. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the \"figures reflect 'Borderless Britain' and total impotence of the British government\" and called on the prime minister to negotiate controls on migration from EU countries. Reaction: UK migration reaches record high UK migration figures 330,000 Net migration to UK, in year ending March 2015 28% Increase since March 2014 10,000 higher than previous peak in 2005 61% of EU immigrants who wanted work had definite jobs to go to 9,000 fewer people have emigrated since 2014 It is the fifth consecutive quarterly rise in the net migration figure - with increases in arrivals from both inside and outside the EU. Net migration of EU citizens was 183,000, up 53,000 from the year ending March 2014. The number of those arriving from countries outside the EU was still larger, with net migration measured at 196,000, up 39,000 on a year earlier. Expansion of the EU and the relatively fast recovery of Britain's economy are seen as key factors in the trend. About two-thirds of the EU migrants were said to be workers, and a fifth students. Among the migrants from outside the EU, about a half were students, a quarter workers, and one sixth family members. Among the other ONS findings based on the latest figures were: In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that he was giving a \"no ifs, no buts\" promise that he would bring immigration numbers down to \"levels our country can manage\". During the election campaign he reiterated this promise and said he would not \"cave in\" and abandon the target. BBC's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there were \"lots of figures, but no cheer for a prime minister who promised he would reduce immigration to levels the country could manage\". \"His ambition on migration is fast turning into a political embarrassment,\" he added. After the latest set of figures, the government insisted it was acting to control immigration but said the EU needed to do more to help ease the current migrant crisis across Europe. Mr Brokenshire said that the \"reliance that business continues to place on migrant labour\" and students staying in the UK after they had finished their studies, were two potential reasons for the rise. \"Current flows of people across Europe are on a scale we haven't seen since the end of World War Two. This is not sustainable and risks the future economic development of other EU member states,\" he added. 'Morally wrong' Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, said David Cameron \"needs to stop the dishonesty over his failed immigration target\". She said: \"All his overblown rhetoric has achieved is a decline in public confidence as the electorate are faced with more broken promises. \"But most troubling of all, the net migration target treats immigration and asylum as the same. That is morally wrong and is preventing Britain playing its part in responding to the terrible refugee crisis that stems from Syria and has spread across Europe. The Institute of Directors and think tank British Future said Mr Cameron was \"punishing businesses\" by trying to fulfil promises to cut immigration. Meanwhile, Jamil Dhanji an immigration barrister told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme migrants were not coming to the UK to claim benefits. \"Migrants I see are not coming to this country for that reason,\" he said. Earlier this week the government announced more details of its new Immigration Bill, which is due to be introduced in the autumn. Under the legislation, illegal immigrants caught working in the UK could face up to six months in prison and late-night takeaways and off-licences will face closure if they are found employing foreigners who have no legal right to be in the country.",

    "text": "Interfaith and inter-caste marriages have long been frowned upon in conservative Indian families, but in recent years, the conversation around such unions has become even more fractious. And most scorn is reserved for alliances involving Hindu women and Muslim men. Just how deep the chasm is was brought into sharp focus last month when popular jewellery brand Tanishq withdrew an advertisement featuring an interfaith couple after a right-wing backlash on social media. The ad showed a baby shower organised for a Hindu mum-to-be by her Muslim in-laws. Tanishq, owned by the Tatas, one of India's biggest companies, called its new range Ekatvam - which translates from Hindi as \"unity\". It was meant to celebrate the concept of \"unity in diversity\", but it ended up doing the exact opposite - it laid bare the fissures that exist in Indian society. Radical Hindu groups said the advert promoted \"love jihad\" - an Islamophobic term that implies Muslim men prey on Hindu women to seduce them and marry them with the sole purpose of converting them to Islam. Social media trolls led calls to boycott the brand, taking it to the top of Twitter trends. The company said in a statement that it withdrew the ad keeping in mind the safety of its employees. Two weeks after the row over the ad, journalist couple Samar Halarnkar and Priya Ramani and their journalist-writer friend Niloufer Venkatraman launched the India Love Project on Instagram, describing it as \"a celebration of interfaith/inter-caste love and togetherness in these divisive, hate-filled times\". Mr Halarnkar told the BBC they had been \"thinking about the project for a year, even more\" and that the controversy over the Tanishq ad lent it an immediacy, turning it into an idea whose time has come. \"We've felt very strongly about - and been disturbed by - the fake narrative around love and interfaith marriage,\" he told me. \"There is a narrative that there are other, more insidious, motives for marriage, that love is being weaponised. But we didn't know anyone who was thinking like that, who had any other motive than love for getting married.\" Through India Love Project, he says, \"we are just providing a platform where people can share their stories\". Since 28 October - when the project kicked off with the first story by Ms Venkatraman about her Parsi mother Bakhtawar Master and Hindu father S Venkatraman - a new story has been published every day. The response, Mr Halarnkar says, has been overwhelming. \"We are struggling to cope. Every day we hear from people who say 'I want to tell my story, or my parents' story or my grandparents' story. It also shows that interfaith and inter-community marriages are not new, they were happening all along.\" But, he adds, \"it's important to talk about them now more than ever\". \"At a time when hate is being manufactured, it's important to tell these stories of love and how widespread it is and that it's not just a flash in the pan.\" In India, more than 90% of all marriages are arranged - and families rarely look beyond religion and caste while fixing alliances. According to the India Human Development Survey, only about 5% of marriages are inter-caste. Interfaith unions are even rarer - one study put them at just over 2.2%. And those choosing to marry outside of these boundaries often face violence - and can even be killed. In recent years, with a Hindu nationalist government in power, conservatism has gained support in India and religious polarisation has grown. And interfaith marriages - especially those involving Hindu women and Muslim men - are being ascribed a much more sinister motive. \"In February,\" Mr Halarnkar says, \"the government told the parliament that 'love jihad' was not defined by law and that no such cases were reported by any government agencies, but the idea persists. In recent days, at least four BJP-ruled states have announced plans to introduce legislation to curb this 'social evil'.\" It is this \"narrative of hate\" that India Love Project seeks to challenge through its bank of personal stories, often described as \"warm and fuzzy\" by readers. The short 150-word stories are written with affection and humour; and tell tales of couples who believe that love does not recognise man-made boundaries. Rupa, a Hindu Brahmin, writes about her mother's first reaction when she told her that she was planning to marry Razi Abdi, a Muslim. \"He'll say 'talaq, talaq, talaq' three times and kick you out,\" her mother said, worried about the practice of instant divorce in Islam, now outlawed in India. \"However, once my parents met Razi and realised what a wonderful human being he was, their misgivings faded,\" she writes, describing them as \"relatively open-minded\". It's been 30 years since Rupa and Razi got married. They have two adult sons and celebrate the Muslim festival of Eid and the Hindu festival of Diwali in their home. Writing about his marriage with Salma, journalist TM Veeraraghav says in their home religion isn't \"as important as curd rice versus mutton biryani!\" \"I remain vegetarian, she enjoys her mutton and the product of our love [their child Ainesh] gets the best of both worlds. Ainesh is a Hindu or Muslim, depending on what's cooking.\" In a recent post, Tanvir Aeijaz, a Muslim married to Vineeta Sharma, a Hindu, writes about the story of naming their daughter, Kuhu. The couple were asked whether it was a Hindu name or a Muslim name? And what religion would their daughter follow when she grows up? \"That our Hindu-Muslim marriage can be a role model of secularism seems to belie people's expectations,\" he writes. \"They're dumbfounded, almost disappointed that our love would have to be called love, and not love jihad.\" The Instagram account also features stories of other interfaith and inter-caste marriages. Maria Manjil, a non-vegetarian Catholic from a liberal family in Kerala, who married Sadeep Jain, a north Indian vegetarian Jain from a conservative family, writes about the \"many challenges\" they've faced in their 22 years of marriage but is convinced that she did the right thing by marrying him. \"How can you turn away from love?\" she writes. \"I saw his kind heart, gentle demeanour, intellectual compatibility, and deep affection for me. I couldn't let him go just because he prayed to a different god and spoke a different language.\" Mr Halarnkar says it's stories like these that make you feel better about the world and about India. \"These are all beautiful stories of myriad realities of India. People follow so many different paths to love. They are a reminder that that's what India is about.\"",

    "text": "By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all? Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been \"almost zero progress\" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries. A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were \"staggering\", with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing. While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out. And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education. Conflict zones Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls. These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict. Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school. And many marry young, ending any chance of an education. UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones. The rankings are based on: For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included. Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education: A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries. Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept. The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school. And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya and learned to read at the age of 60. Gayle Smith, president of the One campaign, called the failures in education for girls a \"global crisis that perpetuates poverty\". \"Over 130 million girls are still out of school - that's over 130 million potential engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers and politicians whose leadership the world is missing out on.\" More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series?

Live streaming via mobile phones has become one of the big technology trends of the year, with Twitter-owned Periscope and Meerkat proving popular. Last year, Amazon paid $1bn for live streaming game site Twitch. Initially Facebook's live video feature will be available only to a small percentage of people in the US and will be limited to iPhones. The tech giant said that \"over time, the company plans to bring it to all users\" but it did not give specific timescales. In a blogpost introducing the service, Facebook said: \"Live lets you show the people you care about what you're seeing in real time - whether visiting a new place, cooking your favourite recipe or just want to share some thoughts.\" The stream will display the number of live viewers, the names of friends who are watching and real-time comments as they are written. The video will be saved to users' timelines until they choose to delete them. Nation of sharers Facebook has also updated the way people can share photo collages - allowing users to mix photos and videos. Ian Maude, an analyst with research firm Enders said of the streaming service: \"Facebook has a vast audience to promote services to so there is nothing stopping it from becoming a significant player in video streaming.\" He said that Britain, like many other countries, had become \"a nation of sharers\". \"We like to tell what what we are doing all the time.\" Privacy advocates have raised concerns about such services but Mr Maude believes that Facebook will be keen to avoid any controversy. \"They will be cognisant of the privacy concerns and I believe there are restrictions on how the content can be shared, so that it won't be automatically broadcast to everyone.\"",

    "text": "Mr Sotloff, 31, was abducted in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month which showed fellow US journalist James Foley being killed. A militant in the latest video also threatens to kill a British hostage. Mr Sotloff's family said they were aware of the video and were \"grieving privately\". After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports. The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq. President Barack Obama has ordered the deployment of another 350 troops to Baghdad to protect US diplomatic facilities, the White house has said. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This second hostage killing video from IS is significant, even though it was largely expected and dreaded. It shows that the recent US air strikes which have halted IS's lightning advance across northern Iraq are causing the organisation real damage, upsetting its plans to extend by force its rule into Kurdistan. Unable to hit back militarily against America's jets, Islamic State has responded with a form of information warfare that it knows will horrify most people in the West. Secondly, by threatening to murder a British hostage, IS shows it makes little or no distinction between the US and Britain as its enemy. This is despite Britain so far restricting itself to dropping aid to refugees and flying in supplies to the Kurdish military, leaving air strikes to the Americans. 'Arrogant policy' The video, entitled \"A second message to America\", is about two-and-a-half minutes long and was apparently recorded in a desert. It appears to have been filmed after Mr Foley's, though it is impossible to determine the exact timing. It shows a masked figure together with Mr Sotloff, who is dressed in an orange gown. Mr Sotloff reads out a text addressed to Mr Obama saying: \"You've spent billions of US taxpayers' dollars and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?\" The masked man, whose voice is similar to that of the man who appeared to carry out the beheading of James Foley, then describes the act he is about to commit as retribution for the US air strikes. \"I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State... despite our serious warnings,\" the man says. \"We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.\" The video ends with the militant threatening to kill the British captive. 'Absolutely disgusting' US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: \"If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act.\" She said it was believed that \"a few\" other Americans were still being held by Islamic State. Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video. \"Our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are with Mr Sotloff and Mr Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,\" he said. \"I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports. \"It's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity.\" UK Prime Minister David Cameron described the apparent beheading as an \"absolutely disgusting, despicable act\". Mr Cameron's office said he has known for months that a Briton was among the hostages taken by Islamic State and has chaired meetings with high-level officials to discuss the situation. But British officials say they have deliberately not commented on this while there has been what they call \"strong family liaison\" with relatives of the hostage. 'Unbiased observer' A friend of Mr Sotloff, US film maker Matthew Van Dyke, told the BBC: \"He was a complete professional and there was no reason for this to happen to him.\" Mr Sotloff was abducted near Aleppo in northern Syria in August 2013. He had worked for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and the Christian Science Monitor, and reported from Egypt, Libya and Syria. Time Magazine editor Nancy Gibbs said in a statement that she was \"shocked and deeply saddened by reports of Steven Sotloff's death\". \"He gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world,\" she said. Friends said he had lived in Yemen for many years and spoke good Arabic. Last month a video was released showing the beheading of Mr Foley. Mr Sotloff was shown at the end, as a militant gave a warning that his fate depended on President Obama's next move. The US has launched more than 120 air strikes in Iraq in the last month, in an attempt to help Kurdish forces curb the advance of Islamic State militants and protect minorities threatened by them.",

    "text": "Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan said he was suspending the acceptance of new arrivals until after a review. Alabama, Texas and several other states issued similar statements but a State Department spokesman said the legality of this action was still unclear. President Barack Obama has urged the US to \"step up and do its part\" to help those fleeing the civil war. \"Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values,\" he said. \"Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security. We can and must do both.\" The governors' decisions come in the wake of the attacks in Paris which killed 129 people on Friday evening. Seven of the perpetrators died in the attacks, and one of them is thought to have been a Syrian who entered Europe via Greece with migrants. Millions of Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and to Europe, and the US has promised to take about 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next 12 months. States saying no While the state of Alabama has not accepted any Syrian refugees so far, the southern state's governor has said that he \"will not place Alabamians at even the slightest possible risk of an attack on our people\". In Michigan, where it has been reported that 200 Syrians have been resettled in the past year, Governor Snyder has said he will suspend the acceptance of new refugees until the US Department of Homeland Security \"completes a full review of security clearances and procedures\". At the scene: Suzanne Kianpour, BBC News Washington US State Department lawyers are investigating whether governors can legally block Syrian refugees from being settled in their states. While the final ruling has not been made, officials say it appears they can't actually block refugees who come into the country through the resettlement program, but they can make it difficult for the non-profit organisations doing the legwork. A state can tell an NGO handling a file that they don't want to work with them and the NGO would simply go elsewhere. But uneasiness about the vetting process and fear of a similar attack in the US is growing, especially on Capitol Hill. The decision to suspend the acceptance of refugees has drawn the ire of some working to resettle them. \"It's vital to keep in mind those who are refugees are fleeing persecution,\" said Michael Mitchell, with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, an organisation working to resettle refugees in the US. But several Republican presidential candidates have said it would be wrong to accept any more. Business mogul Donald Trump described it as \"insane\". The three top Democratic candidates have said they want the US to take more than 10,000 Syrian refugees but only after extensive vetting. On Monday it was reported that a new video released by the so-called Islamic State celebrates the attacks and threatens Washington, DC. Flags on many public buildings across the US are flying at half-mast as an expression of solidarity with France. Syrian refugees in Kentucky",

    "text": "Mountaineer Nimsdai Purja, a member of the group, said they reached the peak at 17:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Dozens of climbers have been on the 8,611m (28,251ft) mountain this winter hoping to achieve the same feat. But one Spanish mountaineer has died after suffering a fall this weekend while descending. K2, which is only 200m shorter than Everest, is part of the Karakoram Range that straddles the Pakistan-China border. One of only 14 mountains higher than 8,000m, it is widely considered the most demanding of all in winter. It has long been referred to as \"the savage mountain\", a name that stuck after US mountaineer George Bell said of his own attempt in 1953: \"It is a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\" Among the most treacherous sections is the notorious \"bottleneck\", a couloir liable to icefalls. Eleven climbers were killed there in an avalanche in 2008. The Nepali climbers were initially spread across three of four competing teams - in all, totalling 60 people. But the 10 Nepalis later formed into a single group to claim the historic achievement in Nepal's name. Mountaineer Nirmal Purja - a former member of the UK's Special Boat Service - shared an image of the group celebrating their achievement, which was confirmed by expedition organiser Seven Summit Treks. \"We are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible,\" said Mr Purja. Since the first attempt in 1987-1988, just a handful of winter expeditions have been attempted on K2. Until now, none has reached higher than 7,650 metres. Nepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry around the Himalayas, and regularly help foreign mountaineers on expeditions. News of the group's success on Saturday has been praised on social media and sparked joy within the Nepalese climbing community - often left out of the spotlight. \"For decades, Nepalis have assisted foreigners to reach the summits of the Himalayas, but we've not been getting the recognition we deserve,\" said Kami Rita, speaking to AFP. \"It is wonderful that today on K2 10 Nepalis have made history and shown our bravery and strength,\" added Mr Rita, who has climbed Everest a record 24 times. As news of their success broke, it was also confirmed that another climber, Spaniard Sergi Mingote, died after experiencing a severe fall. Mr Mingote, 49, was based with another team and had been descending to K2's base camp when he slipped and fell. An experienced mountaineer, Mr Mingote had previously climbed seven of the world's so-called \"8000ers\", including Everest. He had been attempting to summit K2 without oxygen but became severely fatigued, forcing him to abandon the expedition. You might also be interested in:",

    "text": "Lawmakers voted unanimously in favour of a resolution that \"Pakistan should maintain neutrality\" in Yemen. Saudi Arabia had asked Pakistan last month to contribute ships, aircraft and troops to the campaign to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Meanwhile, two planes have delivered relief supplies to Yemen's capital. The aircraft were carrying medicines, bandages and surgical equipment from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN Children's Fund (Unicef). The organisations had to wait days before receiving clearance from all sides in the conflict for the flights to Yemen, where the UN says basic services are unravelling, with widespread food and fuel shortages. 'Proactive role' Pakistan's parliament began debating whether to join the coalition on Monday. Although Saudi Arabia is an ally, many lawmakers spoke out against sending troops to Yemen. Friday's resolution backed the Pakistani government's commitment to protect Saudi territorial integrity and Islamic holy places located inside the kingdom. \"The parliament of Pakistan expresses serious concern on the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and its implications for peace and stability of the region,\" the resolution said. \"[It] desires that Pakistan should maintain neutrality in the Yemen conflict so as to be able to play a proactive diplomatic role to end the crisis.\" Analysis: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Saudi Arabia has been a major foreign donor to Pakistan - some say perhaps the third-largest after the US and China. Late last year, for example, what finance minister Ishaq Dar initially described as a $3bn (£2bn) \"gift from a friendly source\" turned out to be Saudi largesse that was used to stabilise a free-falling rupee against the US dollar. Soon afterwards Pakistan officially backed the Saudi position on Syria. So some resentment in Saudi quarters is to be expected from this vote. But Pakistanis have still left room for a troop deployment in Saudi Arabia if not in Yemen, which Saudis will certainly need if the conflict in Yemen drags on for longer. There is a precedent for this. During the first Gulf War in 1991, Pakistan deployed two brigades to \"defend holy sites\" in Saudi Arabia. The only other example of a Pakistani troop deployment abroad is to Jordan during the \"Black September\" of 1970, to help that government put down a Palestinian insurgency. The coalition of nine mostly Sunni Arab states is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" against the Houthis, a Zaidi Shia rebel movement that the US and Saudi Arabia allege is receiving military assistance from regional Shia power Iran. Analysts say Pakistan, which has a Sunni majority but also a sizeable Shia minority, fears being caught between the two if it sends troops to Yemen. Earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif travelled to Islamabad to urge Pakistan's leaders to reject the Saudi request. 'Humanitarian pause' The rebels and allied army units loyal to Yemen's ousted former President Ali Abdullah Saleh took full control of Sanaa in January and placed Mr Hadi under house arrest. He escaped and took refuge in Aden in February, but left the country at the end of March when the Houthis reached the outskirts of the southern port city. More than two weeks of air strikes have failed to halt the Houthi advance into Aden, as well as neighbouring southern and eastern provinces. Overnight, coalition aircraft targeted the defence ministry building in Sanaa and weapons storage sites. On Thursday, the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator for Yemen called for a humanitarian \"pause\" in the bombardment and fighting on the ground to allow in urgent aid deliveries. Johannes van der Klaauw told reporters in Geneva that the conflict had now spread to 15 of Yemen's 22 provinces. He described the situation in Aden in particular as \"catastrophic\", a descent into urban warfare, with control of the air and seaports shifting daily between rival groups. A million people in the city risked being cut off from access to clean water within a matter of days unless additional fuel is brought in, he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says almost 650 people have been killed and more than 2,200 have been injured since 19 March, but Mr van der Klaauw said the actual number of casualties was likely to be far higher because many were not being brought to hospital or were being buried immediately. Who is fighting whom in Yemen? Houthis - The Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels. Ali Abdullah Saleh - Military units loyal to the former president - forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests - are fighting alongside the Houthis. Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - The president fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels. Saudi-led coalition - A US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states says it is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" of Mr Hadi. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi. A rival affiliate of Islamic State has also recently emerged.",

    "text": "Chief Justice P Sathasivam spared the men, citing delays in deciding their mercy plea. Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan were members of the Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated by Sri Lanka in 2009. Gandhi's murder was seen as retaliation for his having sent Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka in 1987. In 2006, the Tigers expressed \"regret\" for the murder which had shocked India. The three convicts have been in jail for more than 20 years. On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam, said the long time taken by the government to decide the mercy pleas - 11 years - was the ground for commuting the death sentences. \"We are confident that the mercy plea can be decided much faster than what is being done now,\" Justice Sathasivam was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency. \"We implore the government to render advice in a reasonable amount of time for taking a decision on mercy pleas,\" he added. 'Mental anguish' \"The Supreme Court said it is inhuman to keep somebody under the shadow of the noose for so long,\" the men's lawyer, Yug Mohit Chaudhry, told BBC Hindi. \"The death penalty cannot be executed after such a long delay and the government has not been able to explain the delay. The court said the prisoners have undergone unbearable torture and mental anguish during this period,\" he added. The mother of one of the convicted men thanked the court for the ruling. \"I have been waiting for this judgement for a long time. For the past 23 years I have been struggling to get some peace,\" Arupathammal, mother of Perarivalan, told reporters. Rights group Amnesty International India said Tuesday's ruling was \"encouraging\". \"India must now do away with the death penalty - a cruel, inconsistent and irreversible form of punishment that has no proven deterrent effect on crime,\" the group said in a statement. Mr Gandhi was killed by a female suicide bomber as he addressed an election rally in the southern Indian town of Sriperumbudur in May 1991. The three men and Nalini Sriharan, an Indian Tamil woman who was also convicted, were given the death penalty by the trial court in January 1998. The Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences of the men on 11 May 1999, but commuted the capital punishment to life imprisonment for Nalini. Last month, the Supreme Court commuted the sentences of 15 death row prisoners to life in jail on the grounds of delay. Executions are rarely carried out in India, but in the last two years there have been two hangings in India. Mohammed Ajmal Qasab, the sole surviving attacker from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was executed in November 2012 in a prison in the western city of Pune. And in February 2013, a Kashmiri man, Afzal Guru, was hanged in Delhi's Tihar jail for the 2001 attack on India's parliament.",

    "text": "The hikers were not breathing and their hearts had stopped. The search for a total of 45 missing climbers has now been called off for the night. The volcano, about 200km (125 miles) west of Tokyo, erupted without warning on Saturday, spewing ash and rocks. About 250 people were trapped on the slopes of the popular beauty spot, but most got down safely. Japan is one of the world's most seismically active nations - but there have been no fatalities from volcanic eruptions since 1991, when 43 people died at Mount Unzen in the south-west. First deaths confirmed Saturday's eruption forced many of those on the mountain to make emergency descents through clouds of volcanic ash and falling rocks. \"The volcanic rocks fell like hailstones,\" one man said. \"We couldn't breathe so we covered our mouths with towels. We couldn't open our eyes either.\" Another told reporters: \"The volcanic ash was hurtling so fast I couldn't run away. I'm worried about people still on the mountain.\" Almost 50 people were thought to have stayed on the mountain on Saturday night, reports said. Rescue efforts will resume on Monday after an intense search on Sunday was called off because of toxic volcanic gases in the area. It is understood 45 people are still listed as unaccounted for - including those found near the summit. There are fears that others could be buried under volcanic ash. Four people were transported back down the mountain on Sunday and later confirmed dead, Japan's NHK News reported. Japanese officials can only announce deaths after a formal doctor's examination. Analysis: Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Tokyo The question many people have been asking is - why were there hundreds of people on top of an active volcano? And, why was there no warning it was about to erupt? The answer to the first question is that there are lots of active volcanos in Japan, and people hike on them all the time. I have done so myself. Mount Fuji is classed as an active volcano, and hundreds of thousands of people climb it every year. In some ways the people caught in Saturday's eruption were very unlucky. It was a beautiful sunny Saturday at the peak of the autumn hiking season. Had it been a rainy Wednesday in June the chances are very few people would have been up there. The question of no warning is harder to answer. Volcanologists point out this was a relatively small eruption, and that it was driven by super-heated steam and ash, not by lava being ejected from the magma chamber. That made it much more difficult to predict. But it also meant that many of those caught up in the eruption survived. Had it been a large-scale eruption (like the one in 1979) with large pyroclastic flows, many more would have been killed. Lodge sanctuary The sudden eruption on Saturday was described as \"like thunder\" by one woman who runs a lodge near the summit. Heavy, toxic volcanic ash up to 20cm (8in) thick covered much of the mountain, reports said. \"All of a sudden ash piled up so quickly that we couldn't even open the door,\" Shuichi Mukai, who worked in a mountain lodge just below the peak, told Reuters. \"We were really packed in here, maybe 150 people. There were some children crying, but most people were calm. We waited there in hard hats until they told us it was safe to come down.\" Ordinarily Mount Ontake is a popular place to see autumn foliage. Its peak is 3,067m (10,120ft) high and the mountain is a popular hiking route, dotted with lodges, cabins and well-marked trails.",

    "text": "German media name him as Christian B, 43. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed for privacy reasons. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, three, disappeared while on holiday in Portugal in 2007. He is serving a jail term in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, for drug-dealing, having been extradited from Portugal in July 2017. Rape conviction But there is also an ongoing case against him for rape. In December 2019, he was sentenced to seven years by a court in Braunschweig for raping a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005. That took place in Praia da Luz, only one-and-a-half years before Madeleine went missing in the same resort in 2007. He allegedly tied the woman up and gagged her, raped her in her bedroom and forced her to hand over cash. The rape conviction is, however, currently under review in the German courts, German n-tv news reports. There was a legal challenge over extradition technicalities in the case. German police say the suspect lived in Portugal's Algarve holiday area between 1995 and 2007, doing odd jobs, including as a waiter, but also burgling hotel rooms and holiday flats. A senior judicial source in Portugal has told the BBC the joint police investigation into Christian B began after a tip-off in Germany in 2017. The source said German investigators informed their Portuguese counterparts and British officials that they received a tip-off from a friend of Christian B, after the suspect had made a \"disturbing comment\" in a bar in Germany, as they were watching TV news coverage of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance. Since that time, the official said Portuguese police have been making house-to-house enquiries speaking to those who knew him between 1996 and 2007. Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Missing German girl German media say Christian B has also been investigated over the disappearance of a five-year-old German girl - named only as Inga. She went missing from a family party in Saxony-Anhalt on 2 May 2015 and has never been found. According to German official records, Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for theft, forgery, drug-dealing, firearms offences, rape and sexual abuse of children, public broadcaster WDR says. Born in Bavaria in 1977, he grew up in a children's home. In 1994, WDR reports, a court in Würzburg gave him a two-year suspended jail sentence for sexually abusing a child. Christian B was 17 at the time. But in 1995 he moved to Portugal with his then girlfriend and began doing odd jobs on the south coast. They moved into a house together on the edge of Praia da Luz. At the time Madeleine disappeared the suspect was, police believe, living in a white VW Westfalia camper van with yellow skirting. Police are seeking any witnesses who remember seeing the van. German prosecutors have described the suspect as \"a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls\" and was \"serving a long sentence\". Police have released photos of two vehicles - the VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. Christian B received a phone call in Praia da Luz at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be \"critical\". Police have also released photographs of houses with which the suspect is believed to have been linked. It remains a \"missing persons\" investigation in the UK because the police do not have \"definitive evidence\" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not.",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website Imperial College London and the World Health Organization analysed lifespans in 35 industrialised countries. It predicted all would see people living longer in 2030 and the gap between men and women would start to close in most countries. The researchers said the findings posed big challenges for pensions and care for elderly people. \"South Korea has gotten a lot of things right,\" Prof Majid Ezzati told the BBC News website. \"They seem to have been a more equal place and things that have benefited people - education, nutrition - have benefited most people. \"And so far, they are better at dealing with hypertension and have some of the lowest obesity rates in the world.\" The data also forecasts that Japan, once the picture of longevity, will tumble down the global rankings. It currently has the highest life expectancy for women, but will be overtaken by both South Korea and France, the study suggests. Meanwhile, male life expectancy will go from the fourth highest to 11th out of the countries studied. The US also performs poorly and is on course to have the lowest life expectancy of rich countries by 2030. The study predicts an average age of 80 for men and 83 for women - roughly the same state Mexico and Croatia will have achieved. \"They are almost opposite of South Korea,\" added Prof Ezzati. \"[Society in the US is] very unequal to an extent the whole national performance is affected - it is the only country without universal health insurance. \"And it is the first country that has stopped growing taller, which shows something about early life nutrition.\" The US will be overtaken by Chile, where women born in 2030 will expect to live for 87 years and men for 81. Between 2015 and 2030, life expectancy in the UK is expected to go from 79 to 82 for men and from 83 to 85 for women. Men catching up The study, published in the Lancet, also shows the gap in life expectancy between women and men is closing. Prof Ezzati said: \"Men traditionally had unhealthier lifestyles, and so shorter life expectancies. \"They smoked and drank more, and had more road traffic accidents and homicides, however, as lifestyles become more similar between men and women, so does their longevity.\" Much of the increases are due to improvements for the over-65s rather than reductions in deaths during childhood. The study made the projections in a similar way to the methods used by meteorologists to forecast the weather. It combined 21 separate mathematical models that analysed past trends to make projections into the future. This approach indirectly takes account of all the different factors - smoking rates, medical advances, obesity patterns - that are changing life expectancy. It assumes countries continue to progress as they are, so exceptional, unpredictable events equivalent to the fall of the Soviet Union, or huge breakthroughs like a vaccine for all cancer, would massively alter the forecasts. In summary, Prof Ezzati said: \"Places that perform well do so by investing in their health system and making sure it reaches everyone.\" Follow James on Twitter.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent But last week's revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir - as the Indian state was known - and the move to split it into two union territories while imposing an unprecedented lockdown there is being seen by many as a major weakening of India's federal structure. The new union territories (Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh) will be ruled directly from Delhi. Union territories have far less autonomy from the federal government than states. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, calls them \"glorified municipalities of Delhi\". By revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, ostensibly to put it on the same footing as the rest of India, Mr Modi's government, in the words of one commentator, has \"upset India's delicate federal balance\". In many ways, Article 370 - as the constitutional article guaranteeing special status is known - was more symbolic, as presidential decrees over the years had already eroded much of the autonomy it guaranteed. What was more important, many say, was the spirit of the status: it signalled that the Indian constitution was malleable enough to make space for people who felt alienated or estranged from the mainstream. India's federalism has in fact, been hard-earned and hard-fought. Unlike more economically advanced and culturally homogenous countries with a federal system of government like the US and Canada, consensus over power sharing in a culturally and religiously diverse, poorer country like India has not been easy to forge. Thankfully the Indian constitution has provided a clear division of powers between the elected federal government and the state legislatures. \"The constitution strives to strike a delicate balance between the unitary and federal systems,\" says Yamini Aiyar, chief executive of Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research. However, there have always been doubts about what some commentators call the \"authenticity of Indian federalism\". State governors, usually political appointees of the the ruling federal government, have helped clamp direct rule in states where there has been a \"failure of constitutional machinery\". (An adverse report by the governor on the affairs of the state can become the basis of president's rule, or direct rule from Delhi, and authorise the dismissal of a state government.) Such direct rule has been declared in Indian states 88 times between 1951 and 1997. Many believe the revocation of special status from Indian-administered Kashmir - without consulting the local people and political leaders and implemented when the state was under direct rule - is another taint on India's federal record. \"The single biggest significance of this move is that we are moving towards a unitary state, and abrogation of democratic principles. This is weakening federalism in India. People are so busy celebrating the move that they don't seem to get the big picture,\" Navnita Chadha Behera, a former visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution and the author of Demystifying Kashmir, told me. \"What is more worrying is this can happen to any other state. The federal government can dissolve a state government, ride roughshod over the consultative process, split the state and downgrade its status. Also worrying is the near-complete collapse of resistance to the move with most of the civil society, media and regional parties remaining silent or protesting very feebly.\" Yamini Aiyar believes \"federalism, which the framers of India's constitution saw as necessary to India's democracy, today has far fewer takers than it did in 1947. This is dangerous for India's democracy\". Supporters of the move say that strife-ridden Kashmir is a \"special case\", and a consultative process in an insurgency-hit and militarised region next door to India's nuclear-armed rival, Pakistan, would have led nowhere. Also Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has for years consistently demanded the revocation of Article 370, calling it an example of \"appeasement\" in India's only Muslim-majority state. However, India has a history of reconciling separatist aspirations. Where else, many say, could an insurgent leader who fought a guerrilla war for independence for a quarter of a century go on to become an elected state chief minister? But this is exactly what happened when the rebel leader Laldenga signed an accord with the Indian government in the north-eastern state of Mizoram in 1986. Power sharing and inclusivity have only bolstered democracy in India and made the country more resilient. India's Supreme Court, in the past, has clearly said that the \"fact that under the scheme of constitution greater power is conferred upon the centre vis-a-vis the state does not mean that states are mere appendages of the centre.\" \"Within the sphere allotted to them, states are supreme. The centre cannot tamper with their powers,\" the court added. It has also been unequivocal about the status of federalism as a basic constitutional structure. It will be interesting to see how India's Supreme Court deals with the legal challenges against the move on Kashmir. \"This will be a test case for the top court's independence,\" says Dr Behera.

    "text": "Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, died in hospital in Manaus after falling nearly 35m (115ft). Hours later, another worker died of a heart attack at a nearby site. His family said he was overworked. The builders' union is discussing whether to strike over working conditions. Several construction workers have now died at venues connected with the World Cup as Brazil rushes to complete its stadiums on schedule. Two were killed in an accident on 27 November when a crane fell and destroyed parts of Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians, which will host the opening game on 12 June. That accident delayed the stadium's completion date by several months. It is now expected to be ready in mid-April. 'Sunday to Sunday' Andrade Gutierrez, the company building the Manaus stadium, said Mr Ferreira had been employed by a company subcontracted to construct the stadium's cover. It said work had been halted until Sunday. But the death of a second worker, at a convention centre building site, led to new calls by the union to begin a strike from Monday. The body of Jose Antonio da Silva Nascimento, 49, was found late on Saturday morning at the new building, which will host meetings during the World Cup. His death may not be connected with the working conditions, but relatives said he was under pressure because the work was behind schedule. \"He worked from Sunday to Sunday,\" sister-in-law Priscila Soares told O Globo newspaper. The stadium in the Amazonian jungle city is where the England team will open their 2014 World Cup campaign, playing against Italy. Brazil has admitted it is struggling to have all 12 venues completed on time. Six venues are ready; the other six have missed this month's deadline set by Fifa - the world's football governing body. The country's preparations for the World Cup have also been hit by cost overruns and public protests over what is seen as wasted resources. Last week Fifa's General Secretary Jerome Valcke appealed to Brazilians to support the contest saying it was the \"wrong time\" to protest.",

    "text": "Tens of thousands of people have been blocking streets in several areas. The protesters want Beijing to give Hong Kong a free vote for its next leader, something Beijing has rejected. Occupy Central has called on Mr Leung to meet protesters in person on Tuesday night. During a news conference, the pro-democracy group also said it would open \"humanitarian corridors\" in protest areas to allow emergency vehicles to pass. The streets were relatively quiet on Tuesday, with people mainly sleeping and clearing up. But crowds were expected set to swell ahead of Chinese National Day on 1 October. Wednesday is a national holiday marking the founding of Communist China. At the weekend police used tear gas and pepper spray, but riot police have since been withdrawn and protesters remain calm. Key parts of the city are being blocked by protesters, with some schools and banks closed. The protesters want Mr Leung, the chief executive, to step down. But he appeared to reject their demand, saying that his removal would mean Hong Kong's next leader being chosen by a committee, as in 2012, rather than by voters. He also called on the protesters - who include students, supporters of the Occupy Central group and others angered by the police response to the protests - to go home. \"Occupy Central founders had said repeatedly that if the movement is getting out of control, they would call for it to stop,\" Mr Leung said. \"I'm now asking them to fulfil the promise they made to society, and stop this campaign immediately.\" At the scene: Saira Asher, BBC News, Hong Kong Thousands of pro-democracy protesters spent Monday night on the street near Admiralty in Hong Kong's Central district. Some were propped up against barricades, others stretched out in the middle of a major road. After a strong show last night, the crowds have trickled out this morning as people go to work or home to take care of household chores. But they say they will be back later in the evening. This has been the routine now for two days. The crowds diminish in the day but return in full force and stay the night. The morning was spent mostly removing rubbish left over from last night's huge crowd. Students picked up cigarette butts and plastic bottles, others distributed breakfast buns. That is why those on the street are being called \"the politest protesters\" by some on social media. But they are on edge. At one point last night, everyone suddenly stood up and started pulling on masks. It turned out to be just a changing of the guard for the handful of police scattered around here, but the sudden fear was palpable. 'Condemned by history' Beijing ruled last month that Hong Kong people could elect their next leader in 2017. But the choice of candidates will be restricted to two or three people who must be approved by the majority of a pro-Beijing committee - meaning Beijing can effectively screen candidates. In Hong Kong, further consultations had been due to take place on the ruling but on Monday a senior official said these would be postponed until a \"better time\". Occupy Central has accused the government of \"delay tactics\", saying it believed the government was \"just hoping people's desire for genuine universal suffrage to fade out over time\". On Tuesday the group said the areas of Mong Kok, Admiralty and Causeway Bay - where protesters have been blocking roads - would become known among protesters as Democracy Square. In other developments: Not everyone in Hong Kong backs the protests. Some fear the ongoing demonstrations could affect relations with Beijing or hit the economy of the financial hub. China has called the demonstrations illegal and urged the Hong Kong government to bring them under control. News of the protests is being heavily censored in mainland China. Media have blamed \"radical opposition forces\" for stirring up trouble. Analysts say Communist Party leaders in Beijing are worried that calls for democracy could spread to cities on the mainland, putting them in a very difficult position. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula that guarantees liberties not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and the right to protest.

    "text": "Police said fishermen spotted a wooden boat carrying the Rohingya several miles off the coast of Lhokseumawe city on Sumatra's northern coast. The boat contained 297 people, including 14 children, police said. The Rohingya have for years been fleeing persecution in Myanmar for other south-east Asian nations. The arrival in Indonesia was the biggest seen since 2015, said Chris Lewa, the director of the Arakan Project, a non-profit group focusing on the Rohingya crisis. The refugees set sail from southern Bangladesh at the end of March or early April, bound for Malaysia, Ms Lewa said, but were turned back by both Malaysian and Thai authorities because of coronavirus restrictions. She said the refugees may have been held hostage at sea for a period by traffickers demanding money before allowing them to disembark. At least one of those aboard was rushed to hospital on Monday. \"We have seen their condition is very weak at the moment,\" said Oktina, a UN refugee agency co-ordinator, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. Locals reportedly donated food and clothing to the refugees: \"We're concerned about their condition,\" one resident, Aisyah, told the Reuters news agency. \"They need help in the name of humanity... They're human beings like us.\" About 100 Rohingya, mostly women and children, arrived in the same area in June in two groups, after what they said was a four-month sea journey during which they were beaten by traffickers and forced to drink their own urine to stay alive. The refugees that landed in June and the arrivals on Monday may have been part of an estimated 800 Rohingya who reportedly left southern Bangladesh earlier this year, Ms Lewa said. About 30 migrants in the original group were believed to have died at sea, she added. The first port of call for many of the Muslim Rohingya fleeing Myanmar (also known as Burma) is neighbouring Bangladesh, where about a million now live in squalid conditions in refugee camps. Traffickers have preyed on refugees there, offering passage to Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia.",

    "text": "By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Kunduz Behind us, in a corner of the square, a poster displays the pictures of senior police officials killed here in a suicide bombing during another assault by the insurgents last August. For now though, the roundabout is host to a small demonstration in support of peace by about 100 young men. Patriotic songs blast out from a speaker - someone in the crowd is holding a large bunch of balloons with \"I love you\" written on them. \"We've come out in support of peace,\" says Zahid, one of the demonstrators. \"I'm so happy. In the past few days it's been calm in Kunduz and across the country. We want a ceasefire that lasts forever.\" A week-long \"reduction in violence\" is coming to an end in Afghanistan after the Taliban, Afghan army and US-led international forces agreed not to launch attacks against each other for seven days. The period has passed off largely successfully, and the US and Taliban look set to sign an agreement on Saturday in Qatar. It will establish a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban not to allow groups such as al-Qaeda to operate in their territory. It's a key development in the peace process, aimed at bringing an end to America's longest-ever war, and it has boosted hopes amongst a war-weary Afghan population. The rural areas on the outskirts of Kunduz have witnessed fierce fighting. We travel to the village of Taluka, recently re-captured by the government after being in Taliban hands for the past three years. The local school has been obliterated by an air strike, targeting the militants who used it as a base. Nasirullah, an elderly man living next door, saw part of his property destroyed too. \"Four Taliban fighters climbed over the wall to hide,\" he says, \"I told them, 'go away or the house will be hit in an air strike', but they refused.\" Everyone in the village wants to show us the devastation in their homes. Many of the residents are yet to move back in. The Afghan army has been helping to clear landmines but some still remain. Another elderly resident points to a huge dent in a wall of his house caused by a mortar shell. \"I was sitting there with my wife. She was hurt here,\" he says, grabbing his neck. \"Another rocket landed over there. I don't have the money to rebuild all this.\" Nevertheless, he is hopeful. \"I have a TV, and I follow the news,\" he tells me. \"Whenever I hear there will be peace, my heart fills with joy.\" The US-Taliban agreement is a step towards peace, but a full ceasefire, along with the political future of the country, is something that will have to be established in separate discussions between the Taliban and other Afghan leaders. Those talks will follow the signing in Qatar and could last for months, if not longer. Adding to the complication is an ongoing dispute over the results of the presidential elections. Ashraf Ghani was narrowly declared the winner, but his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, has alleged fraud and threatened to form his own, parallel government. Whether or not the \"reduction in violence\" will continue throughout the \"intra-Afghan\" talks as they're known, has not been made public. At an army checkpoint by the eastern entrance to Kunduz city, soldiers check for Taliban infiltrators, worried they might be using the partial truce to smuggle explosives inside. Salahuddin Safai, 32, lives nearby with his extended family. On average, he tells me, the Taliban attack the checkpoint at least every fortnight, surging forward from the fields just beyond his home. Mr Safai says his young children have grown accustomed to the sounds of gunfire, but he worries about the effect on their mental health. He is hopeful that peace will come, but cautious at the same time. The family have seen false dawns before. After the US overthrew the Taliban in 2001, they moved back to Afghanistan from neighbouring Pakistan where they had been living in a refugee camp, thinking the country would prosper. Instead, they found themselves caught along the fluid front lines of a war in which tens of thousands of Afghans have died. \"If we look at our past, similar things have happened,\" he says. \"When the Soviet Union pulled out from Afghanistan, there were peace negotiations, but they failed. A civil war started and the country became what it is now.\" He's referring to what many see as one of the worst episodes in Afghanistan's history, when the rival \"mujahideen\" groups that had successfully battled against the Soviet invasion, fought against both the local Afghan communist government and each other in a brutal quest for power. \"We are a little sceptical of this process but, God willing, history won't repeat itself,\" Mr Safai tells me. There are concerns, too, about what price Afghans might have to pay for peace. Whether the Taliban will accept the country's current democratic system, and the advances in women's rights made in the past two decades. The group have insisted that they believe women should be allowed to study and work, but local residents tell us that in some villages close to Kunduz under Taliban control, girls are prevented from attending school once they become teenagers. For others, though, the priority is an end to the violence. Ghayasuddin, in his 70s, from the village of Taluka, lost both his legs when he stepped on a landmine laid by the Taliban. Could he ever forgive them, I ask? \"If they become our neighbours I'll have to accept them,\" he responds. \"Everything I have is in this village, there's no choice but to learn to live with them.\"",

    "text": "By Kathryn KyteBusiness reporter Tara Bosch describes herself as a former \"sugar addict\". \"I would be the person at the 7-11 every day, buying the penny candy,\" says the 25-year-old. \"But as I got older, I realised how much sugar was affecting my body image, my self-esteem, and just how I felt about myself.\" So four years ago, fed up with how unhappy and unhealthy she was feeling, Tara stopped eating sugar. She says that she very quickly felt much better, but missing her sweets she decided to have a go at making her own no-added sugar alternatives in her kitchen in Vancouver, Canada. Testing recipes in the summer of 2015, she described it as \"going on a quest\". Eventually she was so pleased with her results that she thought there might be a business opportunity. That autumn she decided to take a leap of faith, and put this to the test. Tara dropped out of the third year of an arts degree at the University of British Columbia, so she could get the product off the ground. Just 21 at the time, she had limited credit history, and her only asset was a six-year-old small Honda car. But armed with samples and confidence, she managed to secure 105,000 Canadian dollars of funding. Today, her Vancouver-based company, Smart Sweets, is on track to see its 2019 revenues exceed CA$50m ($40m; £30m). Its range of products are market leaders in the fast-growing low-sugar sweets sector in both Canada and the US. \"This year we are helping people kick more than one billion grams of sugar,\" she says. To secure the initial investment Tara had to write an intensive business plan, with detailed two-year growth forecasting. And somewhat unnervingly, she had to take out life insurance. \"One of the terms of the parties involved was life insurance, and they had to be the beneficiary,\" she says. Sugar-free or not? If you're looking to cut down on your sugar intake but have a sweet tooth, then sugar-free sweets can be better than the regular sweets, say dieticians. But they may still contain carbohydrates, and some can contain significant calories and be high in saturated or trans-fats. \"Keep in mind that just because a product is 'sugar free' it doesn't always mean that it's healthy,\" says the American Heart Association. Some studies also suggest that certain zero-calorie sweeteners may also stimulate appetite, which can be counterproductive for those trying to limit their calorie intake. With the funded secured, Tara searched on the internet for potential suppliers and manufacturers, and worked on finalising her recipes. \"It soon became a trial and error of taking every single iteration that didn't work, and applying a new hypothesis, and then testing it again.\" she says. Tara settled on using plant-based fibres, and the natural sweetener stevia, to mimic the taste and texture of traditional sugared sweets. Then to secure her first customers she used a mixture of emailing, telephoning, showing up in person, and, she says, \"Linkedin-ing\". The first retailer to sign up was Vancouver-based Choices Market, and Tara remembers that she was incredibly nervous ahead of the first meeting. \"I had called and emailed with persistence, until they finally said stop by,\" she says. \"And when I arrived out front, I was so nervous that I drove away. \"Then I drove back, had the meeting, and they became the first retailer to take a chance on Smart Sweets.\" A few other small Canadian chains followed shortly afterwards. \"Like I said, it's about persistence,\" she says. \"I would email and show up until a business would say yes to a conversation, and from there I leveraged the success.\" Tara secured her first American customers in 2018, and the US now accounts for 80% of Smart Sweets' sales. The manufacturing of the sweets also takes place in the US through contract suppliers. More The Boss features: US food entrepreneur and strategist Scott Semel says he is impressed by Tara's \"passion\". \"An annual revenue of CA$50m is very successful,\" says Mr Semel, who in 2016 sold his best-selling confectionary brand Bark Thins to US giant Hershey. \"Just getting to $5m isn't easy, and confectionary is dominated by a few big players. I think what's even more impressive about doing CA$50m in 2019 is the time frame in which she has achieved it. \"Tara has a great feel for the market... she thinks far ahead.\" Now with 47 employees, Tara plans to start exporting Smart Sweets outside of North America. She says that the success of the company has come through hard work and determination. \"For me growing up, I wasn't that smart or athletic,\" she says. \"I didn't really have any talents in particular, but I always had an innate sense of urgency, resourcefulness, and the ability to make something happen if I decided I wanted to make it happen. \"Smart Sweets was the first time I realised the power of those three things combined.\"",

    "text": "By John Sudworth BBC News, Xinjiang At the same time as hundreds of thousands of adults are being detained in giant camps, a rapid, large-scale campaign to build boarding schools is under way. Based on publicly available documents, and backed up by dozens of interviews with family members overseas, the BBC has gathered some of the most comprehensive evidence to date about what is happening to children in the region. Records show that in one township alone more than 400 children have lost not just one but both parents to some form of internment, either in the camps or in prison. Formal assessments are carried out to determine whether the children are in need of \"centralised care\". Alongside the efforts to transform the identity of Xinjiang's adults, the evidence points to a parallel campaign to systematically remove children from their roots. China's tight surveillance and control in Xinjiang, where foreign journalists are followed 24 hours a day, make it impossible to gather testimony there. But it can be found in Turkey. In a large hall in Istanbul, dozens of people queue to tell their stories, many of them clutching photographs of children, all now missing back home in Xinjiang. \"I don't know who is looking after them,\" one mother says, pointing to a picture of her three young daughters, \"there is no contact at all.\" Another mother, holding a photo of three sons and a daughter, wipes away her tears. \"I heard that they've been taken to an orphanage,\" she says. In 60 separate interviews, in wave after wave of anxious, grief-ridden testimony, parents and other relatives give details of the disappearance in Xinjiang of more than 100 children. They are all Uighurs - members of Xinjiang's largest, predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has long had ties of language and faith to Turkey. Thousands have come to study or to do business, to visit family, or to escape China's birth control limits and the increasing religious repression. But over the past three years, they have found themselves trapped after China began detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities in giant camps. The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in \"vocational training centres\" in order to combat violent religious extremism. But evidence shows that many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. For these Uighurs, going back means almost certain detention. Phone contact has been severed - even speaking to relatives overseas is now too dangerous for those in Xinjiang. With his wife detained back home, one father tells me he fears some of his eight children may now be in the care of the Chinese state. \"I think they've been taken to child education camps,\" he says. New research commissioned by the BBC sheds light on what is really happening to these children and many thousands of others. Dr Adrian Zenz is a German researcher widely credited with exposing the full extent of China's mass detentions of adult Muslims in Xinjiang. Based on publicly available official documents, his report paints a picture of an unprecedented school expansion drive in Xinjiang. Campuses have been enlarged, new dormitories built and capacity increased on a massive scale. Significantly, the state has been growing its ability to care full-time for large numbers of children at precisely the same time as it has been building the detention camps. And it appears to be targeted at precisely the same ethnic groups. In just one year, 2017, the total number of children enrolled in kindergartens in Xinjiang increased by more than half a million. And Uighur and other Muslim minority children, government figures show, made up more than 90% of that increase. As a result, Xinjiang's pre-school enrolment level has gone from below the national average to the highest in China by far. In the south of Xinjiang alone, an area with the highest concentration of Uighur populations, the authorities have spent an eye watering $1.2bn on the building and upgrading of kindergartens. Mr Zenz's analysis suggests that this construction boom has included the addition of large amounts of dormitory space. Xinjiang's education expansion is driven, it appears, by the same ethos as underlies the mass incarceration of adults. And it is clearly affecting almost all Uighur and other minority children, whether their parents are in the camps or not. In 2018 work began on a site for two new boarding schools in Xinjiang's southern city of Yecheng (known as Kargilik in Uighur). Yecheng County Middle Schools 10 and 11 Dragging the slider reveals the pace of construction - the two middle schools, separated by a shared sports field, are each three times larger than the national average and were built in little more than a year. In April last year, the county authorities relocated 2,000 children from the surrounding villages into yet another giant boarding middle school, Yecheng County Number 4. Government propaganda extols the virtues of boarding schools as helping to \"maintain social stability and peace\" with the \"school taking the place of the parents.\" And Mr Zenz suggests there is a deeper purpose. \"Boarding schools provide the ideal context for a sustained cultural re-engineering of minority societies,\" he argues. Just as with the camps, his research shows that there is now a concerted drive to all but eliminate the use of Uighur and other local languages from school premises. Individual school regulations outline strict, points-based punishments for both students and teachers if they speak anything other than Chinese while in school. And this aligns with other official statements claiming that Xinjiang has already achieved full Chinese language teaching in all of its schools. Speaking to the BBC, Xu Guixiang, a senior official with Xinjiang's Propaganda Department, denies that the state is having to care for large numbers of children left parentless as a result. \"If all family members have been sent to vocational training then that family must have a severe problem,\" he says, laughing. \"I've never seen such a case.\" But perhaps the most significant part of Mr Zenz's work is his evidence that shows that the children of detainees are indeed being channelled into the boarding school system in large numbers. There are the detailed forms used by local authorities to log the situations of children with parents in vocational training or in prison, and to determine whether they need centralised care. Mr Zenz found one government document that details various subsidies available to \"needy groups\", including those families where \"both a husband and a wife are in vocational training\". And a directive issued to education bureaus by the city of Kashgar that mandates them to look after the needs of students with parents in the camps as a matter of urgency. Schools should \"strengthen psychological counselling\", the directive says, and \"strengthen students' thought education\" - a phrase that finds echoes in the camps holding their parents. It is clear that the effect of the mass internments on children is now viewed as a significant societal issue, and that some effort is going into dealing with it, although it is not something the authorities are keen to publicise. Some of the relevant government documents appear to have been deliberately hidden from search engines by using obscure symbols in place of the term \"vocational training\". That said, in some instances the adult detention camps have kindergartens built close by, and, when visiting, Chinese state media reporters have extolled their virtues. These boarding schools, they say, allow minority children to learn \"better life habits\" and better personal hygiene than they would at home. Some children have begun referring to their teachers as \"mummy\". We telephoned a number of local Education Bureaus in Xinjiang to try to find out about the official policy in such cases. Most refused to speak to us, but some gave brief insights into the system. We asked one official what happens to the children of those parents who have been taken to the camps. \"They're in boarding schools,\" she replied. \"We provide accommodation, food and clothes… and we've been told by the senior level that we must look after them well.\" In the hall in Istanbul, as the stories of broken families come tumbling out, there is raw despair and deep resentment too. \"Thousands of innocent children are being separated from their parents and we are giving our testimonies constantly,\" one mother tells me. \"Why does the world keep silent when knowing these facts?\" Back in Xinjiang, the research shows that all children now find themselves in schools that are secured with \"hard isolation closed management measures.\" Many of the schools bristle with full-coverage surveillance systems, perimeter alarms and 10,000 Volt electric fences, with some school security spending surpassing that of the camps. The policy was issued in early 2017, at a time when the detentions began to be dramatically stepped up. Was the state, Mr Zenz wonders, seeking to pre-empt any possibility on the part of Uighur parents to forcibly recover their children? \"I think the evidence for systematically keeping parents and children apart is a clear indication that Xinjiang's government is attempting to raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language,\" he tells me. \"I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide.\"",

Gay male sex is punishable by up to 30 years in jail in the country. Despite the ban on homosexuality, Tanzania was until recently somewhat more tolerant towards gay people than many other African countries, but a rise in anti-gay rhetoric by the government has led to a spike in discrimination, correspondents say.

In an open letter to the WHO, more than 100 leading scientists had said new findings about Zika made it \"unethical\" for the Games to go ahead. They also said the global health body should revisit its Zika guidance. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it sees no reason to delay or move the Games because of the mosquito-borne disease. The outbreak began in Brazil a year ago, but now more than 60 countries and territories have continuing transmission. Between February and April 2016, Brazil's health ministry registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus. The number of babies born with Zika-linked defects stood at 4,908 in April. While Zika's symptoms are mild, in the letter the experts say it causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and may also cause a rare and sometimes fatal neurological syndrome in adults. The letter is signed by 150 international scientists, doctors and medical ethicists from such institutions as Oxford University and Harvard and Yale universities in the United States. They cite the failure of a mosquito-eradication programme in Brazil, and the country's \"weakened\" health system as reasons to postpone or move the Olympics in \"the name of public health\".

The biggest risk, it adds, is if athletes contract the virus and returned home to poor countries that have not yet suffered a Zika outbreak. They also express concern the WHO has a conflict of interest because of its partnership with the IOC. The Rio Olympics are due to take place between 5 and 21 August. In a statement, the WHO, which has declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency, said: \"Brazil is one of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. \"People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice.\" Several public health experts had previously warned that hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Rio would speed up Zika's spread and lead to the births of brain-damaged babies. But on Thursday, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose advice is quoted approvingly in the letter, said the threat did not warrant halting the Games. \"There is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics,\" Dr Tom Frieden said. However, he urged the US to act more quickly to prevent pregnant women contracting Zika, amid congressional deadlock over the release of $1.9bn (£1.3bn) in funding. And virology researcher Oliver Brady, from Oxford University, said the risk was comparatively low because the Olympics would take place during Brazil's winter. \"We really think August is about 20 to 40 times lower risk than we see around now or in January where we see these large numbers of cases reported from Rio,\" he told the BBC.

    "text": "The Court of Appeal refused Mr Assange's attempt to have a detention order issued in 2010 revoked. Mr Assange, who denies the allegations, has sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition. If he goes to Sweden, he fears he could be extradited to the US to face charges of leaking government documents. Wikileaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have caused intense embarrassment for the US and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations. 'No reason' Two women in Sweden accuse Mr Assange, 43, of sexual assault. Thursday's decision at the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm ruled on an appeal against a similar decision by a lower court. Mr Assange's lawyers argued that the arrest warrant should be repealed because it could not be enforced while he was in the Ecuadorean embassy. Analysis by BBC World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams Before and during his self-imposed incarceration inside the Ecuadorean embassy, Julian Assange has been trying to clear his name through a whole series of legal hurdles. So far without success. Mr Assange's lawyers have attempted to challenge the legal basis for the allegations against him. But the allegations won't go away and today's ruling, while critical of the prosecution's failure to move the investigation forward, makes it plain that Mr Assange still has a case to answer. It offers no opinion on Mr Assange's claim that he cannot leave the safety of the Ecuadorean embassy without running the risk of being extradited to the United States and jailed for his role in the release of classified American military and diplomatic documents. But the fact remains that no such US extradition request exists. A lengthy grand jury investigation has not apparently resulted in any form of indictment. In 2013, when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden began leaking his own stash of damaging material, the importance of Julian Assange suddenly receded. The lawyers noted that Swedish prosecutors had not travelled to London to interrogate Mr Assange. In a statement, the court said there was \"no reason to set aside the detention solely because Julian Assange is in an embassy and the detention order cannot be enforced at present for that reason\". But it also criticised Swedish prosecutors for not making enough effort to explore \"alternative avenues\" to interrogate Mr Assange, saying the \"failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation\". Per Samuelson, one of Mr Assange's lawyers, told Reuters news agency that he believed the court's comments were a \"warning\" to prosecutors, and that the warrant would be revoked at a future hearing. He said the defence team would take the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement: \"Like the court of appeals says, there is every reason to continue considering how the case should be taken forward.\" Smear campaign Mr Assange has not been formally charged in Sweden, but prosecutors want to question him over allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the Scandinavian country in 2010. The Wikileaks founder denies the allegations and has said they are part of a smear campaign against him. The Ecuadorean government granted asylum to Mr Assange in 2012 after the UK Supreme Court refused to reopen his appeal against extradition. Ecuador says there are fears his human rights might be violated if he is extradited. Chelsea Manning, an American soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in the US for passing documents to Wikileaks. But no US extradition request for Mr Assange exists and a spokeswoman at the US embassy in London said Mr Assange was not currently a person of interest.

Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents. The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents. The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence. In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Edward Snowden met four former US security officials in Russia late on Wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what they describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said they had presented Mr Snowden with the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired CIA officers. The officials told Russian media Mr Snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced he had done the right thing. \"He's remarkably centred,\" ex-FBI agent Coleen Rowley told state-funded RT television. 'Legal options' Lon Snowden, arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday, was met by his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena. \"I'm here to learn more about my son's situation,\" Mr Snowden told reporters. \"My hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.\" \"If the opportunity presents itself, I certainly hope that I have the opportunity to see my son,\" he said in televised remarks. \"I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the US. That's his decision, he's an adult.\" Lon Snowden later visited his son, but the place and time of the meeting \"are not being been revealed for security reasons\", said Russia's state-run TV channels Rossiya 24 and Channel One. Lon Snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking \"the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the US. Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend. As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with his consent, The Guardian revealed his identity in June. To escape US attempts to extradite him, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted him asylum. Russia's move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.",

    "text": "By Rebecca MorelleScience correspondent, BBC News Scientists have found that when gusts of high-speed solar particles enter our atmosphere, the number of lightning bolts increases. The research is published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Because solar activity is closely monitored by satellites, it may now be possible to forecast when these hazardous storms will hit. Lead researcher Dr Chris Scott, from the University of Reading, said: \"Lightning represents a significant hazard. \"There's something like 24,000 people struck by lightning each year, so having any understanding or advanced warning of the severity of lightning storms has to be useful.\" As the Sun rotates, the fiery ball of plasma hurls out charged particles that travel at between 400-800km a second (900,000 to 1.8 million miles per hour). The arrival of these solar winds in the atmosphere can trigger displays of the Northern Lights, but this research shows how they could influence our weather too. \"The solar wind is not continuous, it has slow and fast streams. Because the Sun rotates, these streams can be sent out behind each other - so if you have a fast solar wind catching up with a slow solar wind, it causes a concentration to occur,\" said Dr Scott. The scientists found that when the speed and intensity of the solar winds increased, so too did the rate of lightning strikes. The team said the turbulent weather lasted for more than a month after the particles hit the Earth. Using data from northern Europe, the researchers found there was an average of 422 lightning strikes in the 40 days after the high-speed solar wind arrived, compared with 321 strikes in the 40 days prior. The finding was surprising, said Dr Scott, because it had been thought that an increase in the solar wind would have the opposite effect. He explained: \"It's unexpected, because these streams of particles bring with them an enhanced magnetic field - and this shields Earth from the very high-energy cosmic rays from outside of the Solar System - these are generated when supernovae explode, and they accelerate particles up to the speed of light.\" Previous research has shown that cosmic rays from space can boost the rate of lightning, and it had been thought that an increased shielding effect from the solar particles would cause a decrease in the number of strikes. \"Instead what we actually saw was a marked increase in lightning. It turns out these solar winds bring with them a slightly lower energy population of particle - and these are enhancing the lighting rate,\" Dr Scott said. The team is not exactly sure of the mechanism, but said that the particles may be penetrating storm clouds, making it easier for them to discharge electrical energy as a bolts of lightning. \"What we need to do now is to track these energetic particles down through the atmosphere, to see if we can see where they end up,\" said Dr Scott. \"We know these particles aren't energetic enough to reach the ground, so they must be stopped somewhere in the lower atmosphere, and we need to know where this is.\" However, while the questions of how still need to be answered, there is plenty of information about when the particles arrive, which could help with storm forecasting. \"These solar wind streams are very predictable. We know the Sun rotates every 27 days, so there is a very strong recurrence rate. If we see them at one time, we know 27 days later it will be back again,\" said Dr Scott. While the data was collected in Europe, the researchers believe the effect is global. Follow Rebecca on Twitter",

But some Syrians told the BBC many were being deported to Idlib, inside Syria, where fighting is escalating. They say many are being forced to sign voluntary return documents that they cannot read or understand. The order to relocate was issued in late July, giving those affected about a month to comply. About half a million Syrians are registered in Istanbul - but estimates suggest twice that number are living there, having travelled from the provinces they were first registered in. Announcing the move last month, the governor of Istanbul said Syrians with the right to be in the city should carry their passports and identity documents with them at all times, and announced continuous checks at bus and train stations. Doors in Turkey are closing By Mark Lowen, BBC Istanbul Correspondent Turkey is proud of its reputation as the world's largest host of refugees, welcoming 3.6 million Syrians since the war began. But patience with the Syrians is wearing thin. Under international humanitarian law, the \"non-refoulement\" principle prohibits deporting migrants to a warzone. The Turkish government says Syrians returning home are going voluntarily, and to areas secured by the Turkish army. But we've spoken to several who say they've been deported to Idlib, where fighting rages. In Syrian neighbourhoods of Istanbul, stories of forced relocation are everywhere; of people made to sign voluntary return documents they weren't given the chance to read. \"When I crossed the border and saw the Turkish flag behind me, I realised I hated it because this is a racist country,\" said one Syrian, who had been deported but had smuggled himself back to Istanbul. Another, who we spoke to in Syria, said Turks saw Syrians \"like insects sucking their blood\". Eight years since the war began, doors are closing in Turkey and the welcome is running out. By early August some 12,000 migrants had been transferred to their registered province, and more than 2,600 unregistered people had been put into centres run by the interior ministry. Thousands of workplaces have been inspected \"to prevent unregistered employment\". Polling has shown a decline in support for Syrian refugees - from about 70% to 40% – seen as one factor that drove President Erdogan's party out of power in Istanbul in this year's mayoral election. The Turkish government says migrants who want to return to Syria are being transported to safe areas of the country under the control of the Turkish army. On Monday, a Syrian government air strike on a Turkish convoy killed three civilians and injured 12 more, Turkey said. The region is supposed to be protected by a \"buffer zone\" agreed last year.

Interior Minister Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan said that the drone strike was \"not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts\". Mehsud clan The announcement of the new leader was made by the Taliban's caretaker leader Asmatullah Shaheen at a news conference at an undisclosed location. When the news was announced, there was reportedly heavy celebratory gunfire in the area around Miranshah, the main town in the tribal area of North Waziristan. Mullah Fazlullah led a brutal campaign in Swat between 2008 and 2009, enforcing hardline Islamic law, that included burning schools, and public floggings and beheadings. A military operation was launched to retake the area. Mullah Fazlullah fled over the border into Afghanistan but Islamabad says he has continued to orchestrate attacks in Pakistan. He was accused of being behind a roadside bomb in September that killed Maj Gen Sanaullah Niazi, the top commander in Swat, along with two other military personnel. Mullah Fazlullah was known for his radio broadcasts calling for strict Islamic laws and earning him the nickname \"Mullah Radio\". The shooting of Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 sparked outrage in Pakistan and across the globe. The teenager had spoken out against the Taliban's restrictions on girls' education. She was airlifted to the UK for hospital treatment and now lives in Birmingham with her family. This year Malala, now 16, addressed the UN General Assembly and won the European Union's Sakharov human rights prize. Prior to the latest Taliban announcement, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad said that Mullah Fazlullah was not a member of the Mehsud clan and, if appointed, would face a challenge to control the Mehsud fighters, who make up the bulk of the Taliban's manpower. The Taliban's ruling council took seven days to reach a decision. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come to power in May pledging a negotiated settlement to the insurgency, but militant attacks continued. The government said a delegation had been due to fly to North Waziristan to discuss peace talks with Hakimullah Mehsud but he was killed in the drone strike the day before. There had been some hope a new leader of the Taliban would be more open to the peace initiative. Regional Taliban commander Khan Said Sajna, said to favour such a move, had been touted as a favourite before the latest announcement.",

    "text": "By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent The much-trumpeted Abraham Accords - that saw the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan all sign agreements with Israel - were always going to be hostage to events on the ground. Now those events have descended into deadly violence, any further public warming of relations between the Arab states and Israel has been put on hold. The Abraham Accords, concluded with such fanfare in the final months of the Trump administration, saw several Arab countries not only formalise their relations with Israel but also embark on unprecedented cooperation with it, across a wide range of sectors including security and intelligence. Within weeks of the signings in Washington, the head of Israel's external intelligence agency, Mossad, was given a VIP welcome in the Gulf - something unthinkable even a year ago. Yet today governments of the signatory nations, notably the UAE and Bahrain, find themselves in a deeply uncomfortable position. Having told their populations of the coming benefits of teaming up with Israel in the fields of trade, tourism, medical research, green economics and scientific development, they now find themselves metaphorically squirming as 24-hour TV footage shows Israel's bombardment of Gaza, the threatened eviction of Palestinians from their East Jerusalem homes and the recent storming by police of that city's sacred Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. The Saudis, who came under heavy pressure from the US to jump on the normalisation bandwagon, are breathing a sigh of relief that they resisted it, perhaps fearing that something exactly like this could happen. Jerusalem, as the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Madina, holds a special place in the hearts of Muslims and Arabs across the world, so the events at the Al-Aqsa mosque have touched a raw nerve for Saudis as well as others in the region. Bahrain's government has been one of several to issue statements this week reaffirming its support for the Palestinian cause. Michael Stephens, an Associate Fellow at the London-based think-tank Royal United Services Institute, points out that the Arab promise that the Abraham Accords would give countries like the UAE some leverage over Israel to help the Palestinian cause has turned out to be hollow. Not even a plea from President Biden to calm the violence seems to be having much effect right now. Most Arab governments in the Gulf have little love for Hamas, a violent militant group backed by Iran that has so far fired well over 1000 rockets and missiles indiscriminately at Israeli towns. But the sympathies of those countries' Arab populations lie firmly with the Palestinians. If there was some reluctance amongst them to accept the newfound friendship with Israel after so many decades of antipathy then recent events will have only deepened their scepticism. Yet Arab state media coverage of this conflict is not quite as one-sided as it used to be in previous Arab-Israeli clashes. Saudi Arabia's Al-Arabiya TV coverage focussed on the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza but it also showed footage from Israeli towns where civilians fled for cover from Hamas's rockets and sirens wailed. Sky News Arabia, based in the UAE, also focussed on Gaza but included Israeli statements that it was targeting senior Hamas commanders. Qatar, which along with Jordan and Egypt is seeking to mediate an end to the conflict, has close ties with Hamas, something reflected in its ongoing TV coverage. So how will this conflict affect relations between Israel and its Arab partners in the long term? That depends in large part on how much longer it lasts and whether casualties keep rising. The Arab governments that have normalised their relations with Israel know they have an enormous amount to gain from that newfound partnership, especially in the field of cutting-edge technology. But not at the expense of fomenting domestic unrest at home. For now, they cannot afford to be seen to be close to a state that is killing Palestinians, whatever the provocations from Hamas. \"There is no way the UAE will break off the Abraham Accords,\" says Michael Stephens. \"But relations will go into a holding pattern until events calm down\". In practice that means bilateral contacts will continue in private, behind closed doors, as they have done for years, but the days of smiling, joint ambassadorial press conferences are probably over for now.",

    "text": "By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The South Korean megahit had been the site's most-played clip for the last five years. The surreal video became so popular that it \"broke\" YouTube's play counter, exceeding the maximum possible number of views (2,147,483,647), and forcing the company to rewrite its code. But the song has now been overtaken by another music video - Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's See You Again. The heart-wrenching ballad has now been streamed 2,895,373,709 times; beating Psy's current count of 2,894,426,475 views. Adding it up, that means See You Again has been streamed for a total of 21,759 years. If one person was to listen to each of those streams consecutively, they'd have to have started during the glacial peak of the last Ice Age. \"I joined YouTube in 2007 hoping to make a video that would reach 10,000 views,\" wrote Charlie Puth on Twitter. \"Just heard about See You Again... Wow.\" The song was written for the action movie Furious 7, playing over the closing credits in tribute to the actor Paul Walker, who died in a car accident before the film was completed. With its unabashedly sentimental lyrics (\"it's been a long day without you my friend/ And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\"), See You Again has become one of the most frequently requested pop songs at funerals in the UK. It was the best-selling song worldwide in 2015, and received best song nominations at both the Grammys and the Oscars. The music video features the final scene of Furious 7, in which the two main characters Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Cody Walker, filling in for his brother, Paul), drive side-by-side, sharing a smile for the last time before they pull onto separate roads and drive into the sunset. As the camera pans up into the sky, a title card reads \"For Paul\" and the video ends. The video reached 1 billion views in six months, and hit 2 billion last September. However, its reign as YouTube's most-watched clip may be short-lived. Luis Fonsi's summer smash Despacito has racked up 2.5 billion views in just six months, and it shows no signs of slowing down. The Puerto Rican song - sung in a mixture of Spanish and English - has been number one in the UK for the last eight weeks, thanks in part to a remix featuring Justin Bieber. Whoever takes the title, though, its good news for Universal Music, which owns all of the songs. Meanwhile, 47 of the top 50 clips on YouTube are music videos, proving the importance of the streaming site to the music industry - despite the fact the two sides are locked in a battle over royalty payments. According to analysis by Midia Research, every stream on YouTube generates $0.001 for the music industry. If accurate, that means Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's song has earned $2.9m (£2.2m) from YouTube - roughly the same amount it has made from 665 million plays on Spotify.

    "text": "By Tom Calver and Nassos StylianouBBC News These are just some of the findings from the BBC's life expectancy calculator, which uses data from the Global Burden of Disease project by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). We have shared our findings in the charts below. 1. We're living longer Global life expectancy has risen more than seven years since 1990, equivalent to a year gained every three-and-a-half years. People around the world are living longer thanks in part to lower death rates from heart disease in high-income countries and fewer child deaths in low-income countries. Improved health care, better sanitation and medical advances in treating diseases have also contributed to the rise. Healthy life expectancy - the number of years you can expect to be in good health - also rose by 6.3 years. However, the rate of global growth has started to ease off again. 2. Western Europe dominates the top Fourteen of the top 20 countries for life expectancy are in Europe, but East Asia tops the pile overall: people born today in Japan and Singapore can expect to live to 84 years old. As for the home nations, England just about sneaks into the top 20 with a life expectancy of 81 years, while Northern Ireland comes in at 32 and Wales 34, both with 80 years. Scotland ranks 42nd out of 198 countries with a life expectancy of 79 years. 3. African countries dominate the bottom All but two of the bottom 20 countries are from Africa. Children born in 2016 in Lesotho and the Central African Republic - which has been ravaged by civil war - have a life expectancy of only 50 years, 34 fewer than those born in Japan. Meanwhile, decades of war, drought and lawlessness make Afghanistan the only Asian country near the bottom, with a life expectancy of only 58. 4. Women generally outlive men Women outlive men in 195 out of 198 countries, and on average by six years. However, in some countries that gap is as much as 11. As the chart below shows, many of the biggest gender differences are in Eastern Europe and Russia, where comparatively low male life expectancy has been explained by alcoholism and poor working conditions. The three countries where men outlive women are the Republic of Congo, Kuwait and Mauritania. 5. In Ethiopia, life expectancy rose 19 years Since 1990, life expectancy has improved in 96% of countries. Back then, people born in 11 countries would not be expected to reach 50, yet this milestone was reached by every country in 2016. Six of those 10 biggest improvements have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia, still recovering from famine in 1990, had a life expectancy of only 47. Babies born there in 2016 could expect to live 19 years longer thanks partly to significant decreases in respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases, such as rotavirus and cholera. 6. However, life expectancy fell in eight countries As well as having some of the biggest rises in life expectancy, sub-Saharan Africa also has four of the eight countries where life expectancy has fallen since 1990. The biggest drop was in Lesotho, where according to UN estimates, one in four people are living with HIV - the second highest rate in the world. Babies born in neighbouring South Africa in 2016 can expect to live to 62 - two years fewer than their compatriots born 25 years before, in 1990. During this period, the country has struggled with the effects of a widespread HIV epidemic. 7. Cross-border differences Life expectancy can be surprisingly localised - some neighbouring countries had almost 20 years between them. For example, cross the border from China into Afghanistan, and life expectancy falls by more than 18 years. And Mali - which has suffered years of terrorism and civil strife this decade - has a life expectancy of only 62, but people born in neighbouring Algeria can expect to live to 77. 8. War has a devastating impact Back in 2010, Syria was ranked 65th in the world for life expectancy, in the top third of countries. However, years of unrelenting war have seen it drop to 142nd place in 2016. Meanwhile, at the height of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, life expectancy at birth was only 11 years. 9. As do famine and natural disasters North Korea suffered a devastating famine between 1994 and 1998 that knocked several years off its life expectancy until the early 2000s. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have died from the Haiti earthquake in 2010. However, life expectancy did recover the following year.

    "text": "Turkey accused Greece of failing in the \"fight against terrorism\" and said the decision was \"politically motivated\". The eight men fled in a helicopter to Greece after last July's coup attempt but say they were not involved. Presiding judge Giorgos Sakkas said the men were unlikely to receive a fair trial in Turkey. Turkey has demanded the three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors return to stand trial. The soldiers have argued their lives would be in danger. They are accused of playing a significant part in the coup attempt on 15 July 2016, and of having links with a group which allegedly tried to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the night of the attempted coup. \"We protest this decision which prevents these individuals who have threatened the life of our president and took an active role in a coup attempt that killed 248 of our citizens... from appearing in front of Turkish judiciary,\" Turkey's foreign ministry said in a statement. In retaliation to the Greek Supreme Court's ruling, an Istanbul court has approved a request from prosecutors for an arrest warrant for the eight soldiers. A turn for the worse: Analysis by the BBC's Selin Girit in Istanbul Turkish-Greek relations have gone through very difficult phases in the past, but the general understanding was that those days were over. Now, relations between the two countries risk a dramatic turn for the worse. Ankara's heavy-handed response in contesting the Greek Supreme Court's ruling with the issuing of an arrest warrant is a clear accusation to Athens of a failure to co-operate in the arrests of Kurdish or ultra-leftist militants in the past - a general understanding shared by nationalists in Turkey. The extradition bid had become a source of tension between Ankara and Athens in the last few months. Several closed-door meetings reportedly took place between the two countries' foreign ministry officials but no solution could be reached. The case has presented a diplomatic dilemma for Greece and created new tensions between the two Nato allies. They have a complex relationship and are currently working together to help negotiate a peace deal in divided Cyprus. Greek Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis said before the verdict that he would respect the decision and not intervene. The eight soldiers in Greece have said that their relatives in Turkey have lost jobs and had their passports confiscated since they fled. Read more In the wake of the coup attempt, tens of thousands of people from every level of Turkish society have been purged from their jobs, including military officers, government officials and schoolteachers. Critics of Mr Erdogan say he has used the failed uprising as a way of removing his opponents and tightening his hold on power. The Turkish government says that it has taken legitimate action to root out \"terrorist\" groups that had infiltrated the state. It blamed US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who leads a mass movement in Turkey, for the bloody coup attempt. He denies any involvement. Soon after the soldiers arrived in Greece, they were given two-month suspended prison sentences for illegally entering the country. 'A scandal' - Turkish media respond to the ruling, by Pinar Sevinclidir, BBC Monitoring Pro-government news outlets have branded the decision \"a scandal\" and accused Greece of \"protecting the coup soldiers\". Yeni Safak daily said Greece was taking the plotters under its wing and Aksam newspaper called the ruling \"a historical disgrace\" A Haber TV report hinted at a diplomatic crisis, saying \"the relationship between Turkey and Greece will change after this decision\".",

    "text": "Branding the advice sexist, students mounted a campaign to encourage everyone, male and female, to wear short skirts on campus on Thursday. Medellín's Pontifical Bolivarian University, known as UPB, had posted the advice on its website. After an outcry, it said the tips were only meant as general suggestions. \"The UPB respects the right to express personalities, and has never imposed a dress code on students,\" said its statement, adding that the article had been mostly aimed at new students. The original post, now deleted, appeared under a heading, \"How should you dress to go to university?\" Some of the advice was presented as unisex, but there were plenty of tips directed at women. Dress discreetly, it advised. \"There is nothing more uncomfortable than distracting your classmates or teachers. For this reason, we suggest you don't wear low necklines, short skirts or tight-fitting clothes.\" It was posted on 30 January and spread through students' social media accounts, prompting an online campaign under the hashtag #UPBEnFalda (meaning UPB in miniskirts). According to El Tiempo newspaper, the university had issued the advice after a video circulated online, showing a male student aggressively raising a girl's skirt until she falls on the floor. The university did not mention this in its original statement, but the following day it tweeted to say the post and the video had no connection. It said the matter was under investigation. On Thursday, after a rallying cry online calling for people \"not to be scared\", students shared pictures of themselves and classmates in shorts and skirts around the university. Local journalist Jenny Giraldo tweeted [in Spanish] to say the idea of having to police your clothes so others can control themselves is akin to advising people not to get raped. Student Helena Múnera tweeted: \"Those who think that we are fighting for our right to wear short skirts or low necklines are very wrong. What we are asking for is an end to messages that encourage disrespect of women.\" City councillor Daniela Maturana also joined in, tweeting: \"If a woman is wearing a skirt or shorts or whatever she wants to wear, it is NOT a green light for cat calls or harassment.\" Political sciences student Mariana Duque Díez was among those deliberately wearing a skirt to class on Thursday - although she said she often does, and so does at least one of her teachers. \"The frustrating thing is most students and teachers do not feel represented by these old-fashioned institutional positions,\" she told the BBC. \"We feel much more plural.\" You might also be interested in: It is not the first time the university has been accused of sexism. In 2015, it launched a summer-school class aimed at girls aged five to 10, teaching them good manners. The course was called \"Girls' things\".",

    "text": "Mr Meng was first reported missing in late September after travelling from Interpol HQ in France to China. His wife has revealed that he sent her a text message with a knife emoji on the day he went missing. Mr Meng is the latest high-profile target to be ensnared in China's sweeping anti-corruption campaign. He is also a vice-minister for public security in the country. In its announcement of the investigation, China's Public Security Ministry said the probe was \"correct, wise and shows the determination of [President Xi]'s administration to continue its anti-corruption drive\". Interpol is the global policing agency that co-ordinates between police forces around the world, including searches for missing and wanted persons. Interpol's general secretariat oversees the day-to-day work of the 192-member organisation, with the role of the president largely ceremonial. After Mr Meng's disappearance was made public on Friday, speculation had mounted that he had been taken into custody. A number of top Chinese government officials, billionaires and even an A-list celebrity have vanished in recent months. Last week, actress Fan Bingbing, who disappeared in July, emerged with a public apology and a fine of 883 million yuan ($129m; £98.9m) for tax evasion and other offences. But correspondents say that Mr Meng's high-profile position at Interpol was once seen as a prize for Beijing, raising questions about whom he might have angered or what he might have done to be targeted as part of President Xi's anti-corruption blitz. What has Interpol said about the matter? In a statement on Twitter on Sunday, it said it had received Mr Meng's resignation with immediate effect. Under its terms it has appointed senior vice-president Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as acting president. A new president will be elected for the remaining two years of Mr Meng's mandate at the general assembly in Dubai next month. On Saturday, the international police agency urged China to clarify Mr Meng's status, saying it was concerned about the well-being of its president. There has been no word from him on the charges he faces. What did his wife say? French authorities have opened an investigation and have placed Mr Meng's wife under police protection after she received threats. Grace Meng, speaking shortly before China's confirmation of the detention, had told journalists she thought he was in danger. She issued an emotional plea for international help to find her husband. On the day he went missing, she said he had sent her a social media message telling her to \"wait for my call\", before sending a knife emoji, signifying danger. With her back to the cameras to avoid being identified out of fear for her safety, she held back sobs to read out a statement in Chinese and English. \"We are always connected by [our] hearts. He would support me in doing this. The matter belongs to fairness and justice. The matter belongs to the international community. The matter belongs to the people of my motherland.\" The reach of the Communist Party Analysis by Robin Brant, in Beijing When Meng Hongwei was appointed two years ago, one newspaper here wrote that it would \"promote understanding abroad of China's justice system\". This is probably not what was envisaged back then. His \"resignation\" and apparent detention makes it clear that it's the laws of China - and the rules of its governing Communist Party - that trump all else for any government official. Even if they're appointed to a job in France. China's new National Supervision Commission - an anti-corruption agency - said Mr Meng was being investigated for \"violation of laws\". Importantly it didn't mention - as is often the case with high-profile detentions like this - the charge of \"violating party rules\". The anti-corruption body has targeted thousands of people in a relentless drive led by President Xi Jinping. There are also rumours that Mr Meng may have been purged because of his links to another senior party figure out of favour with the leadership. Will this affect China's image? The investigation into Mr Meng has raised some concern that international institutions will be reluctant to appoint Chinese officials to high positions - something Beijing has pushed for in recent years. Chinese nationals hold top positions at several global institutions including the UN, IMF, World Bank and Unesco. But Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing said while he believes the current case is not likely to affect future appointments, it does have an impact on China's image on the international stage. \"There's obviously going to be some bad publicity around this and it's not like China doesn't care about this,\" he said. \"But whatever they want Mr Meng for has in this case trumped their concern for international public opinion.\" Who is Meng Hongwei? He was elected Interpol president in November 2016, the first Chinese person to take up the post, and was scheduled to serve until 2020. He headed the organisation's Executive Committee, which provides overall guidance and direction. Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control. After his election, human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country.",

Brent recovered to $33.95, down less than 1% on the day, while US crude climbed back to $33.42, down 1.6%. Oversupply has hit oil prices, which are now 70% lower than in June 2014. Companies and governments that rely heavily on oil revenues have been suffering as a result. Adding to the continuing fall in oil prices, China depreciated the yuan on Thursday, sending regional currencies and stock markets tumbling.

China's stock markets were suspended less than half an hour into trading on Thursday, after falling 7% and triggering a new circuit-breaking mechanism for the second time this week. Overnight, the US Department of Energy's weekly report showed a sharp drop in US commercial crude inventories of 5.1 million barrels to 482.3 million. The government data also showed a gain in US crude production of 17,000 barrels a day, taking it to 9.22 million barrels a day, the fourth consecutive week of increases. There was also a rise in stockpiles at the Cushing oil hub in Oklahoma. Oil is so oversupplied globally that countries are running out of storage. The US, which is thought to have among the largest storage facilities in the world, has nowhere left to keep it, according to Paul Stevens, professor emeritus at the University of Dundee and a Middle East specialist. \"Storage is pretty much full and people are already talking about buying tankers as floating storage,\" he said. \"But if supply continues to outstrip demand, then the only thing that you can do with the oil is sell it, which inevitably pushes the price down.\" The huge storage overhang means that even if US production falls this year, as oil companies halt production, it will take several months to get rid of excess supplies.",

    "text": "BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why Each year during summer solstice, it's thought that 10,000 dogs are cooked and eaten in Yulin, in Guangxi province in southern China, as part of the city's yearly dog meat festival. Although it's not illegal to eat dog meat in China, opinion is divided on how deep the \"tradition\" really runs. On Chinese social media in recent years, the Yulin Festival has become a focus for the large numbers of animal lovers - mostly within China - who are against it. But this year, the reaction has gone global. Since May, almost a quarter of a million tweets have been posted using the hashtag #StopYulin2015, with most of the activity coming from the UK, the US and Australia. One of the loudest voices has been the US animal welfare group Duo Duo, whose change.org petition calling for the cancellation of the event has received more than 200,000 signatures. The group's campaign video on YouTube has been viewed more than 130,000 times. \"I went to a slaughter house in Yulin a few days ago. The dogs and cats were wearing collars and of different sizes and breeds. They were very friendly,\" says Duo Duo founder Andrea Gung. \"Dogs are man's best friend. To kill more than 10,000 of them in one day is wrong,\" she says. Activists have also raised health concerns - although the meat is traditionally seen as having health benefits, campaigners claim the dogs transported into Yulin come from the black market and could be diseased. \"The consumer thinks they're safe to eat but they're not,\" says Gung. Duo Duo has intentionally targeted a Western audience with its social media campaign, rather than campaigning within China, as it says it doesn't want to interfere with the activities of local activists. \"The main thing we have done is made people in Yulin realise that their tradition is something from the past, that is perceived negatively from the outside world,\" says Gung. The conversation about Yulin has been mostly negative on western social media, but the chatter has been more mixed on the Chinese network Weibo. A page dedicated to discussing \"Yulin Dog Day\" has generated almost 350,000 comments. Many Weibo users expressed concern at the idea of eating dogs and shared loving images of their pets. But others accused animal welfare activists of hypocrisy and said local values in Guangxi Province should be respected. So just how widespread is the eating of dog meat in China? \"Although meat eating has increased in China over the past 30 years as the country becomes more affluent, dog meat is really not widely available,\" says Sam Geall, executive editor of the China Dialogue environmental blog. \"In the 15 years that I have been travelling to China I have never once been offered dog meat.\" Some have even claimed that the Yulin Dog Festival and similar events are in fact designed to draw in international tourists. \"It's common that local tourist administrators will capitalise on elements of their past to attract revenue and tourism,\" Geall says. But with increasing numbers of middle-class Chinese owning pets, criticism of the practice within China is growing fast. \"The perception of dog-meat eating has changed because of social media,\" says Geall. \"Over the past five years there has been a growth in the number of domestic animal welfare groups using Chinese social media to campaign against the consumption of dog meat.\" Blog by Anne-Marie Tomchak Next story: Protesters target Facebook's 'real name' policy Follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.",

    "text": "The blast in Tripoli destroyed the embassy's ground-floor reception area and perimeter wall, as well as damaging neighbouring homes and shops. French President Francois Hollande called on Libya to act swiftly over this \"unacceptable\" attack. It is the first major attack on a foreign embassy in the Libyan capital. Tuesday's explosion happened shortly after 07:00 (05:00 GMT) in a smart residential area of Tripoli. One of the embassy's guards was severely injured while the other suffered lighter injuries. Several residents were also slightly hurt. One young girl suffered a spinal cord injury and was being transferred to neighbouring Tunisia for treatment, her father told the BBC. The blast took place in a small side street and left a scene of devastation, the BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli reports. As well as extensive damage to the embassy building and perimeter wall, two nearby homes were badly damaged and others affected, while the windows of a shop were blown out and two parked cars were burnt out. Many neighbours who gathered in the street to survey the damage were shaken and upset by what had happened, our correspondent says. They told her that there was a lack of proper policing for such a potentially high-profile target. \"It was a big mistake to site the French embassy in our neighbourhood,\" a local resident said. President Hollande said the attack had targeted \"all countries in the international community engaged in the fight against terrorism\". \"France expects the Libyan authorities to shed the fullest light on this unacceptable act, so that the perpetrators are identified and brought to justice,\" he said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius - who has arrived in Libya to see for himself the damage - said French officials would work closely with the Libyan authorities to find out who was responsible for what he called an \"odious act\". Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdel Aziz condemned the bombing as a \"terrorist act\", but did not speculate on who might be behind it. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. French embassies across northern Africa have been on high alert since France sent in troops to help fight an Islamist insurgency in Mali in January. France, under Nicolas Sarkozy, was at the forefront of Nato-led air strikes in 2011 that helped rebel forces topple long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The US consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi was attacked by armed men in September 2012, leading to the killing of ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other American officials.",

He said the Taliban must know they need to give up their arms. But he emphasised that the peace process \"must be Afghan-owned; it must be Afghan-led\". At a joint press conference in Kabul with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Mr Cameron stressed that the country's future was in the hands of the Afghan people. \"I believe that the Taliban, watching all this progress, are beginning to realise that they are not going to secure a role in Afghanistan's future through terror and violence but by giving up their arms and engaging in a political process. \"But let me make absolutely clear this peace process is for Afghanistan to determine. \"It must be Afghan-owned; it must be Afghan-led. There is no other agenda that Britain has, that America has, that any country in the West has - no other agenda other than your stability, your security and your prosperity, that is why we wish this peace process well, but it must be your peace process, not anybody else's.\" President Karzai said violent attacks by Taliban, like the one on the presidential palace several days ago, would not deter Afghans from seeking peace. \"We have had them killing the Afghan people but we still ask for peace. This was peanuts, comparatively speaking. Quite an irrelevant attack. \"We are more concerned when they attack the Afghan civilians; we are more concerned when they attack Afghan schools and children. I wish they would spend all their time attacking the presidential palace and leave the rest of the country alone.\" The incident came just days after representatives of the Taliban opened an office in Qatar's capital, ostensibly for starting negotiations about a peace process. The US also announced it would begin formal talks to be followed by the direct Afghan talks. Tactical hindsight Mr Cameron spoke after comments came the most senior British soldier in Afghanistan, Gen Nick Carter, said the Taliban should have been invited to the negotiating table in 2002, soon after they were removed from power. Gen Carter told the Guardian it would have been easier to find a political solution when the Taliban were \"on the run\" in 2002. \"I think that at that stage, if we had been very prescient, we might have spotted that a final political solution to what started in 2001, from our perspective, would have involved getting all Afghans to sit at the table and talk about their future. \"The problems that we have been encountering over the period since then are essentially political problems, and political problems are only ever solved by people talking to each other.\" Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff said, on Saturday, that it was easy to make comments with hindsight. \"I think to say 'did we miss a trick' will be for the historians to judge. \"The fact is... the military has been there deployed in their request as part of the International Security Assistance Force for over a decade, as part of a UN and a Nato mandate, and with many other nations we have set the conditions for politics to play a part. \"And so really I think the general's remarks are in the context of politics now playing a part in the future of Afghanistan.\"",

    "text": "\"We once again urge the Philippines to withdraw... from the islands that it is illegally occupying,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday. It comes after about 50 protesters, mostly students, landed on Pagasa in the Spratly archipelago on Saturday. They said they wanted to highlight growing Chinese encroachment. China claims almost all the South China Sea, believed to be rich in resources, dismissing rival claims by neighbours. Apart from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam all lay claim to the disputed waters. The protesters, led by a former naval commander and called Kalayaan Atin Ito (Kalayaan This Is Ours), landed on Saturday and said they would stay for three days - they told the BBC that they would leave by 30 December. They have described the journey as a \"patriotic\" voyage and a symbolic act of defiance against China. The government did not sanction the journey and citied safety and security concerns. Tension has intensified over the last year, fuelled by China's aggressive island-building and naval patrols and the area has also seen the US and Australia undertaking freedom of navigation operations. A recent BBC investigation witnessed at close quarters China's construction of new islands on coral reefs in the area and was repeatedly warned off by Chinese authorities while on a civilian flight in the vicinity of the islands. The Philippines has a case challenging Beijing before the arbitration court in The Hague. It says the \"nine-dash line\", which China uses to demarcate its territorial claims, is unlawful under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which both countries have signed. China has boycotted the proceedings, insisting that the panel has no authority to rule in the case.",

    "text": "By Divya AryaBBC Delhi Just before Christmas the church of St Sebastian in Delhi was gutted by fire - one of five churches in the capital to have been attacked in the past year. The pastor of St Sebastian's, Father Anthony Francis, didn't believe the police theory that the fire was caused by a short circuit so started gathering evidence himself. Only when he showed officers a film of oil on top of puddles of water in the wrecked church, did they start an arson investigation. But no-one has been arrested in this case, or in relation to the four other church attacks. The congregation of St Sebastian, meanwhile, gathers under plastic sheets suspended from a nearby community centre. India's much larger Muslim minority has also been under pressure. In the months leading up to last year's election, violence flared between Muslims and Hindus in the town of Muzzafarnagar, 100km (62 miles) north of Delhi, leaving more than 60 people dead. While no riots on that scale have occurred since, smaller incidents are common. \"Just like those riots, now Hindus in the villages are trying to drive Muslims out of the villages - repeated attacks have created an atmosphere of fear,\" says Mohammad Jamshed, whose brother-in-law, Deen Mohammad, was left paralysed in the sleepy town of Kairana, not far from Muzzafarnagar, in May. In a bitterly ironic twist, it happened as protesters held a demonstration to demand police action to stop violence against Muslims. \"I stopped to watch and was hit by a bullet fired from inside a police car,\" says 18-year-old Deen Mohammad. \"I felt numb, walked a few steps and then fell down. Then I started vomiting blood.\" He fears he will never walk again. Police say the bullet recovered from Mohammad's body is not a type they use, but they are investigating complaints that officers used excessive force that day. The previous month a Muslim labourer in the nearby village of Shamli was returning home from Delhi by train when a gang of about 10 Hindu men beat him brutally with rods in the groin, before stealing his money and pulling his beard from his face by the roots. \"The police have not done anything except register a complaint. And now when I go out, I fear that something like this may happen again,\" says the man, giving his name as Faizan, aged 26. Stories such as these usually go unnoticed by the media. They seem to some all the more worrying when seen alongside derogatory comments about minorities from a number of BJP politicians. \"Each Hindu woman should mother four children in order to protect the predominance of Hindus,\" said one MP, Sakshi Maharaj. \"Should the country be led by sons of Ram [a Hindu god] or by sons of bastards?\" asked the country's Minister for Food Processing Niranjan Jyoti - implying that non-Hindus were bastards. Another MP, Giriraj Singh said, \"Those opposing Modi will have to go to Pakistan.\" Later he was appointed to be minister for micro, small and medium enterprises. But according to the Minister for Minorities Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, \"You cannot judge the government with isolated incidents of violence or isolated statements by some ministers.\" Narendra Modi himself has presented a moderate face of Hindu nationalism since becoming prime minister. \"Our government will not allow any religious group belonging to the majority or the minority to incite hatred against others overtly or covertly,\" he said in February, under pressure to respond to the church attacks. But recently-released statistics on inter-communal violence for the first half of 2015 indicate that there has been a 30% increase compared with the same period of 2014 - a total of 330 attacks, 51 of them fatal, compared with 252 attacks, of which 33 were fatal, in 2014. The Muzzafarnagar riots mean that the statistics for 2013 were even worse, however. And even the events of Muzzafarnagar pale in comparison with the anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 when Narendra Modi was the state's chief minister. Then, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in clashes after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a fire on a train. There are other forms of discrimination, as well as outright violence, which are harder to measure. \"It's not just whether you go and kill Muslims and chase them out, it's not just about burning someone's house down, it's denying them jobs, it's denying them places to stay, it's making them live in terror,\" says Booker prize-winning author Arundhati Roy. \"While Modi pretends to be a statesman and travel to various places and is pressurised to speak the language of diversity, the goons have been unleashed on the ground.\" Even middle-class urban Indians like herself, she says, are now wary of criticising the ideology of Hindu nationalism. \"It's not just Muslims or Christians, perhaps the people they hate the most are the ones who are standing up for a different way of looking at the world, and therefore need to be silenced.\" Father Anthony says the burning of his church \"was like burning India's constitution\", with its guarantees of religious freedom. \"I fear that if the country becomes a Hindu nation, goes on the track of Pakistan and starts using laws such as the blasphemy law to target minorities, what kind of country will we have?\" he asks. \"That will be real injustice, it won't be a blessing, it'll be a curse on the nation.\" Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",

    "text": "Shaker Aamer was held at the US military base in Cuba over allegations he had led a Taliban unit and had met Osama Bin Laden, but was never charged. Downing Street said there were \"no plans\" to detain him after his arrival. Mr Aamer said he felt \"obliged\" to everyone who fought for him to be released, and to \"bring an end to Guantanamo\". \"My thanks go to Allah first, second to my wife, my family, to my kids and then to my lawyers who did everything they could to carry the word to the world,\" he said. \"I am overwhelmed by what people have done by their actions, their thoughts and their prayers, and without their devotion to justice I would not be here in Britain now.\" Concern has been raised over the health of the Saudi national, 48, whose family live in London, and the BBC witnessed an ambulance arrive at the airport. Number 10 said Prime Minister David Cameron \"welcomes\" the release of Mr Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is British. It also said any necessary security measures \"will be put in place\". The father-of-four landed at London's Biggin Hill Airport shortly before 13:00 GMT. Mr Aamer's father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, said his release was a \"miracle\". \"It's a delightful day,\" he told BBC News while admitting it was also a \"surprise\". Mr Aamer, who was first held by US authorities in Afghanistan in 2001, maintains he was in the country doing charity work. Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents George W Bush and then Barack Obama. It is understood Mr Aamer will go through standard immigration checks now he has arrived in the UK. Mr Aamer's legal representative Clive Stafford Smith told BBC News: \"Shaker only wants the truth to come out he is not interested in persecuting anyone. \"His first priority is health - he really is in terrible shape.\" In letters sent to the BBC by his lawyers earlier this month, Mr Aamer described himself as \"an old car that has not been to the garage for years\", saying the first thing he wanted once freed was a cup of coffee. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent When the business jet carrying Shaker Aamer landed in London he was met by British officials. His lawyers say he will need urgent medical and mental assessments. He may, like others who have been held at Guantanamo, be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. While the PM has said Mr Aamer won't be detained, it's unlikely we will ever find out if MI5 separately decides to monitor him - by definition its work is secret. Mr Aamer is said to be relaxed about such prospects and has asked his lawyers to make clear he believes he has a \"contract\" to honour with the people of Britain. Shaker Aamer's return is the end of an astonishing and murky personal saga. But it's by no means the end of the story. The government's long-promised investigation into substantial allegations that our agencies became mixed up in rendition and torture - unwittingly or otherwise - hasn't happened. Shaker Aamer and many others want to know the truth. Who is Shaker Aamer? What now for Guantanamo detainee? Shaker Aamer in his own words 'Falsely imprisoned' Mr Aamer's release has been welcomed by some human rights groups and a number of MPs - but others say serious questions remain unanswered. Amnesty International said Mr Aamer's alleged torture in front of British agents in Afghanistan was a very serious claim that required investigation. Tory MP David Davis said he was keen to speak to Mr Aamer, saying: \"When Mr Aamer is ready to talk, the Shaker Aamer All-Party Parliamentary Group, and I am sure many more MPs, look forward to seeing what he has to say about his detention.\" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \"Shaker was simply a man in the wrong place at the wrong time, a charity worker building wells in Afghanistan who was kidnapped, ransomed and falsely imprisoned.\" But Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society - a think tank which supports liberal democracies and an interventionist approach to foreign affairs - said: \"Any joy and relief at his release must be tempered by the fact that this is someone who has had very serious questions posed of his past connections and conduct.\" Lawyer and journalist Jonathan Foreman told the BBC Mr Aamer's lack of a trial was \"not so incredible\" because he was \"not detained in the same way as a criminal trial, he was detained on the battlefield as an unlawful combatant\". 'Approved for transfer' Mr Aamer was detained in Afghanistan by bounty hunters tracking down and handing over possible al-Qaeda suspects, shortly after the 9/11 attacks in the US. He was detained on the same day his youngest son was born, and has never seen him. Mr Aamer was first held by US forces at Bagram air base, near Kabul, where his lawyers say he was tortured. They say he made false confessions to end his torture. In February 2002, Mr Aamer was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where his lawyers say he suffered further abuse. The US Department of Defense said on Friday a review had been conducted of Mr Aamer's case. \"As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, Aamer was unanimously approved for transfer.\" the statement said. Some 112 people are still being held at Guantanamo, which President Obama has promised to close, the statement confirmed. Guantanamo Bay is a US military prison in Cuba, set up during the \"war on terror\" in 2002 to detain what the US government called \"enemy combatants\". The first 20 detainees were transferred to the facility on 11 January of that year, and a total of 780 men have been held since then - the vast majority without charge or criminal trial.",

    "text": "A two-judge bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court awarded bail to three law students from the elite Jindal Global Law School who had been convicted by a lower court in March for blackmailing and gang-raping a fellow student. Hardik Sikri and Karan Chhabra were sentenced to 20 years in prison, while their friend Vikas Garg was handed a seven-year term. They were all also found guilty of other crimes and given smaller terms, but these were to run concurrently. According to court documents, the young woman had a consensual relationship with Sikri in November 2013 which lasted a month, after which she broke up with him. But for the next 18 months, he used her nude photographs to blackmail her and rape her. Not just that, he also forced her to have sex with his two friends and on one occasion, Sikri and Chhabra gang-raped her. The convicts appealed in the high court and asked to be freed on bail while the case was being heard - and the court agreed. In a country where thousands of people under trial languish in prison for decades, often for minor crimes, it is shocking that men convicted of crimes as serious as gang-rape and blackmail were freed on bail. What is worse is that the short 12-page court order is littered with statements that have been described by the Indian media as some of the \"worst examples of victim shaming\". The young woman was castigated for drinking beer, smoking, taking drugs, keeping condoms in her room and not confiding in her parents that she was being abused. Here are some excerpts from the judgement: Read the full court order In their order, Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Raj Shekhar Attri said they intended \"to balance the concerns of the victim, demands of the society and law and the element of reformatory and rehabilitative justice\". \"It would be a travesty if these young minds are confined to jail for an inordinate long period which would deprive them of their education, opportunity to redeem themselves and be a part of the society as normal beings,\" they added. Predictably, the court order has been greeted with howls of protest in India. Many took to social media to express their anger and the victim's friends started a petition on change.org condemning the judgement. Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy told the BBC that the order \"implies she had no right not to be raped\". A judgement like this, she says, takes away hard-won victories for women's legal equality. \"This order seems to be innocent of the legal definition of consent and of the judgements of the Supreme Court that are quite clear that even a woman of 'easy virtue' may well withhold consent. Any sex after that is rape,\" Ms Nundy says. In a society steeped in patriarchy, it's not uncommon for women to be blamed for inviting sexual assault and rape. Victims are often blamed for wearing short skirts or jeans, having boyfriends, being out late at night, or even talking on mobile phones. In fact, until 2003, we even had a law that allowed victim shaming. Under Section 155(4) of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, it was essentially the rape victims who were put on trial and the accused were often allowed to go scot-free if they could prove that \"the victim was of generally immoral character\". In 1980, the Law Commission suggested that the archaic law be amended and in 2000, the Commission recommended its deletion, saying that it could destroy a victim's reputation and self-respect. Decades later, however, victims continue to be shamed.",

He is accused of making a recent threat to kill Mr Roy on social media. Avijit Roy, a US citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was hacked to death by men with machetes last Thursday while visiting Bangladesh. His wife was badly wounded. Colonel Ziaul Ahsan, from Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), told local media bdnews24.com that Mr Farabi was leaving the city when he was arrested in Dhaka's Jatrabarhi area on Monday morning. RAB spokesman Major Maksudul Alam said he was \"the main suspect\" in the attack on Avijit Roy, who was a critic of religious intolerance. Mr Roy's family said he had been threatened by Mr Farabi on Twitter and Facebook, Maj Alam said. \"[Roy's] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times,\" he told AFP news agency. Police accuse Mr Farabi of involvement with the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Bangladesh. On Sunday, the Bangladeshi government accepted a US offer of FBI help to assist in the murder inquiry. Wife in hospital Avijit Roy was attacked last Thursday evening by men wielding machetes as he returned from a book fair in Dhaka, his native city. His wife Rafida Ahmed also suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack and remains in hospital in a serious condition. Mourners gathered on Sunday in Dhaka to pay their respects to Mr Roy. \"Free thinking in Bangladesh is becoming a great danger,\" Reuters quoted writer Shahriar Kabir as saying. \"We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.\" Farabi Shafiur Rahman is currently on bail in a second case, having been previously arrested over online postings following the murder of another anti-extremism blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, in 2013. Ahmed Rajib Haider was among a group of bloggers who had called for the execution of Islamist leaders for crimes committed in Bangladesh's 1971 independence war.

    "text": "By Tim Whewell BBC Newsnight A citizens' protest movement has been challenging the jihadist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), an affiliate of al-Qaeda, after its fighters attacked churches in the city of Raqqa. But activists who have fled to Turkey told BBC Newsnight that many had been arrested, beaten or kidnapped by ISIS in retaliation. Raqqa, a city currently sheltering nearly a million people, is now under the full control of the group. One of the activists, photographer Mezar Matar, said: \"I saw many people who had signs of lashes on their bodies after being released from an ISIS prison.\" He said his brother, Muhammed Nour, had disappeared after filming a battle in Raqqa between ISIS and a brigade loyal to the Western-backed Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). He believed Muhammed had been kidnapped by the jihadists. Another activist, who asked not to be named for her own safety, said she and her sister, also involved in the protest movement, had fled after being fired at by ISIS gunmen. \"Seven or eight men with explosive belts surrounded my sister. Some said: 'Knife her.' Some said: 'Shoot her.' They tore down her banner that said 'Christians and Muslims are one', and told her she was an infidel,\" the activist said. The protests started in September after jihadists raised their black flag over a church in Raqqa and turned it into their headquarters. \"Two carloads of armed fighters went onto the roof of the church. They broke the bell with hammers, and threw one of the crosses down into the street. They tried to break it, but it was iron,\" the activist said. Activists filmed protesters carrying the cross through the streets shouting \"Shame! Shame!\" and calling for Muslim-Christian unity. 'New dictators' Earlier this year, Raqqa became the first provincial capital in Syria to fall fully under rebel control. But after only two months when control was shared by SMC-aligned and jihadist fighters, it was taken over in May by ISIS. They marked the moment by publically executing three men they said were Alawites, members of the same heterodox Shia sect as President Bashar al-Assad. Now Raqqa, its population swollen by displaced families, may be the largest city in the world ever to be controlled by al-Qaeda. Mr Matar said: \"They banned the sale of alcohol, they tried to close cafes where boys and girls sit together, they banned street theatre, cinema, bright colours, and forced women to wear Islamic dress. \"They are the new dictators, just like Bashar al-Assad, but dressed in black. Only the colour has changed.\" Smaller but better funded than other rebel groups, ISIS has historically been made up of foreign jihadists from Arab countries - particularly Iraq, but also Libya, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia - Russia's north Caucasus, and Europe. But activists from Raqqa said it was now attracting more and more Syrian recruits. In the last few months, ISIS has made significant advances, largely at the expense of the FSA, and controls a wide swathe of northern Syria close to the Turkish border.

    "text": "The move comes amid heightened tensions with Iran over the safety of shipping lanes in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia confirmed that King Salman had approved the move \"to strengthen regional security and stability\". The kingdom has not hosted US combat forces since 2003, when Donald Rumsfeld announced their withdrawal. The US presence in Saudi Arabia started with Operation Desert Storm in 1991, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. BBC North America correspondent Peter Bowes says the US is understood to be deploying Patriot air defence missile batteries manned by 500 soldiers to Prince Sultan Base in Saudi Arabia. The US also plans to send a squadron of F-22 stealth fighters to the base. \"This movement of forces provides an additional deterrent and ensures our ability to defend our forces and interests in the region from emergent, credible threats,\" a statement from US Central Command said. What's the background? Tensions between the US and Iran have worsened since Washington unilaterally withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The US has since tightened sanctions it re-imposed on Iran's oil sector. Last month, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz, accusing it of violating Iranian airspace. The US insisted the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned it as an unprovoked attack. The US has also called on Iran to release a Panamanian-flagged tanker and 12 of its crew, which was seized by Revolutionary Guards on Sunday during a naval patrol. Iran said the vessel had been smuggling fuel. Then on Thursday President Donald Trump said a US warship had destroyed an Iranian drone that came too close. Iran has denied losing a drone. On Friday tensions ratcheted up even higher when Iranian forces seized the UK-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in the Gulf saying it was in breach of regulations. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt demanded the tanker's release, saying there would be \"serious consequences\" if Iran continued to detain it. The US has also blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent On a damp winter evening, Deepika Padukone stood in solidarity with a throng of students at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), protesting against a shocking campus attack allegedly by a mob of rival students linked to Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made no speeches, and left as quietly as she arrived. Within minutes, social media erupted with a frenzy that only a Bollywood star can whip up in movie-mad India. Padukone's fans and peers and student leaders lauded her for her \"brave support\" for the embattled students of the university, which has long been in the crosshairs of right-wing groups supporting Mr Modi's government. Even those who usually scoff at Bollywood declared that they would watch her new film - a feature on an acid attack victim which Padukone has produced and acted in - several times. Familiar supporters of Mr Modi's government rebuked the actress, saying she was cynically mining publicity for her new film. On Twitter, rival hashtags asking people to both support and boycott her new film began trending. The kerfuffle over Padukone's visit to the troubled campus is understandable. The 34-year-old actress of nearly three dozen films is truly a megastar in the world's most thriving film industry. She has an imposing social media presence - 26 million followers on Twitter and 42 million on Instagram. In 2016, Forbes ranked her the 10th highest-paid actress in the world. The next year, she and her star husband Ranveer Singh made an estimated $21m (£16m) in combined earnings, according to the magazine. After working with her on a Hollywood film, Vin Diesel waxed eloquent: \"Anyone could talk about how beautiful she is, and anyone could tell you about her unmatched comedic timing. But she isn't just a star. She's an actor's actor, dedicated to the craft.\" Over the years, Padukone has gained a reputation as a sensitive, thinking actor. She has spoken openly about her battles with depression, and will travel to Davos later in January to speak about her work in trying to raise awareness about mental health. She also faced right-wing ire over her 2017 film Padmaavat, where she and Singh played the lead roles. Protesters vandalised cinemas and threatened to chop off Ms Padukone's nose, referring to a story in an Indian epic where a character has her nose chopped off as punishment. Padukone's campus visit was a compelling image. Bollywood filmmakers and actors have often been pilloried for not speaking up. Successive governments in the past - especially led by the right-wing Shiv Sena party in Mumbai - have openly threatened filmmakers for making films they didn't like. The Bollywood filmmaker, director Mahesh Bhatt once said, is \"a vulnerable animal, especially when his film inches towards release. You can blackmail and make him kneel down.\" Mr Modi himself has assiduously courted Bollywood and has happily posed for selfies with supportive actors and directors. So is Padukone's act an inflection point of sorts? Will it encourage other Bollywood A-listers to \"stand up - and stand in\" as a newspaper described her campus visit? The students' protest in India against Mr Modi's government is remarkable because it is has been led by civil society and not political parties. \"In a sense, Padukone had captured the spirit of the moment. This is the politics of solidarity beyond ideology. So her presence in JNU was important,\" sociologist Shiv Visvanathan told me. Other are not so sure. In a sharply polarised country - pitting those who endorse Mr Modi's muscular Hindu nationalist politics against those who believe in a secular India - people who dismiss what they describe as \"troublesome left-wing students\" are not likely to be swayed by Padukone's visit. \"I am also not sure that people who have criticised her will stop watching her films. Our public culture is not one of consistent ideological positions. It is far more ad hoc. We are capable of holding deeply contradictory opinions. We mostly live in a threshold society rather than one which has clear distinctions between good and bad, left and right. People, for example, support both a strong state and an open economy,\" Sanjay Srivastava, a professor and sociologist, currently at the Institute of Economic Growth, told me. To be sure, Padukone is not the only Bollywood heavyweight who has spoken out against Mr Modi's politics. A number of young female actors and well-known directors have attended protests against a controversial new citizenship law and the JNU campus attack. Anurag Kashyap, one of India's best-known directors, told a network last night that Mr Modi's government had \"divided the country into two kinds of people - the anti-nationals and the patriots\". Before meeting the students at JNU, Padukone told a news network that she was \"pained\" by what was going on. \"It pains me because I hope this doesn't become the new normal. It's scary, and sad. This is not what our country's foundation was,\" she said. It is easy to be cynical about the politics of celebrities, but Padukone's remarks sounded like genuine anguish. \"I think this is a very significant moment. She knows the consequences of speaking out, yet she has risked a lot of things by standing up,\" says film critic Shubhra Gupta. \"Who knows what it will lead to? Will more stars speak out now?\" Time will tell. Read more from Soutik Biswas",

    "text": "Poorer and younger respondents were more likely to face discrimination due to their sexuality, the survey found. Some 93,000 people in the EU and Croatia were polled in the EU's first survey on this scale. Gay rights campaigners welcomed the report but called for stronger legal action by Brussels to tackle the issue. Ilga-Europe, a non-governmental organisation which surveys attitudes to gay issues, told the BBC it regretted that a comprehensive EU Anti-Discrimination Directive drafted by the European Commission in 2008 had yet to be approved by EU leaders. Ilga's own annual report published on Thursday found \"little legislative progress towards protecting LGBTI [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender/Transexual and Intersexed people] from discrimination in accessing goods and services\". In a survey ranging across both the EU and the rest on Europe, the NGO noted the hostility gay people encountered in former Soviet states like Russia and Georgia when they tried to demonstrate publicly. On Friday, about 10,000 anti-gay protesters in the Georgian capital Tbilisi stormed police barricades, beating and chasing a couple of dozen gay activists who had tried to mark the international day against homophobia. Unreported discrimination The report by the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) was launched at a conference in The Hague attended by some 300 politicians and experts. Respondents were asked in the survey whether they had experienced discrimination, violence, verbal abuse or hate speech on the grounds of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The survey found Ioannis Dimitrakopoulos, head of the FRA's equality and citizens' rights department, told the BBC News website it was unclear whether the reported level of homophobic crime had increased because of a past lack of data. The survey was commissioned in 2007, the same year the FRA was created, after the EU gained new powers to tackle discrimination, he said. Despite the findings of the survey, Mr Dimitrakopoulos said there appeared to be a \"pattern across Europe whereby things seem to be improving for the younger generation\". \"From circumstantial evidence, it is possible to say that the situation has improved, both in legal terms and in people's perceptions,\" he argued. Spat at Ilga's communications manager, Juris Lavrikovs, said that while the EU report was welcome, it was regrettable that the EU's 2000 directive on equal treatment in employment had not been extended to cover access to goods and services. The EU had made \"tremendous progress\" legislatively and in terms of promoting awareness of gay rights, he told the BBC, but the economic crisis had increased radicalisation, complicating the lives of gay people. \"Look how easily political opinion is being manipulated in Europe, how certain rhetoric can provoke violence, and it is very easy for people to go back into the closet,\" he said. \"Look at France, which used to be considered a very liberal, very open country. Now it is scary for a gay couple to walk hand in hand in Paris because of the increase in violence.\" The EU survey suggests Lithuania has one of the worst records for homophobic behaviour. Tomas Vytautas Raskevicius, project assistant at the Lithuanian Gay League, told the BBC: \"Lithuania has one of the highest suicide rates in Europe. \"We have this real feeling that a lot of suicides are connected to homophobic bullying. The authorities don't talk about it out loud, and the daily harassment and remarks in the streets and public places is very widespread.\" One gay man from the Netherlands, John van Breugel, told the BBC he was shocked by the scale of the problem. He himself, he said, had been subjected to homophobic abuse only twice in his life. \"First when I was in Germany with my boyfriend and a couple came up and called us 'dirty gays',\" he said. On the second occasion, he was in London when someone spat in his face as he went to the shops. He said the EU should do everything it could to tackle hate crime against gay people, including sanctions on countries that allowed homophobic attacks to happen.",

    "text": "By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The 37-year-old was told by doctors that she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer without this radical treatment because of genes she inherited from her mother. Jolie explained that her mother fought breast cancer for nearly a decade and died at the age of 56. While most women will not have the same access to expensive private medical care as Jolie, testing for high-risk breast cancer genes is available in many developed health systems around the world. The NHS in the UK offers free testing to anyone who could be at high risk because they have a strong family history of the disease. Most cases of breast cancer are not caused by inherited genes, but around one in 500 people carries a gene that puts them at high risk. Surgery to remove both breasts can slash this lifetime risk down to about 5%. Jade effect Jolie hopes that by speaking out about her own experience more women will get tested. Jolie is not the first celebrity to change women's attitudes to cancer. In 2009, 27-year-old reality TV star Jade Goody announced that she had terminal cervical cancer. Her death in March of that year sparked a massive increase in the number of women coming forward to be screened for this cancer. Robert Music, director of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: \"We saw an extra 400,000 women going for screening. That's a rise of 12%. \"It had a huge effect. When Jade was diagnosed as terminal the news was in everyone's living rooms twenty-four-seven. \"As a charity, we saw a 300% increase in demand for our services at the time.\" This came mostly from young women with whom Jade's story had struck a chord. Sadly, the Jade effect was short-lived, says Robert Music. Screening rates fell back down again a year later and have remained so. Dr Richard Francis of Breakthrough Breast Cancer says we may well see a 'Jolie effect' for breast cancer. \"It may raise awareness among women, which is important. \"There are many different types of breast cancer and that is not something that is really appreciated. It's often seen as one disease. \"We do not want women to be scared or worried but we do want women to be aware.\" He said it was important to remember that BRCA gene faults were rare and in most cases linked to family history. \"For women like Angelina it's important that they are made fully aware of all the options that are available, including risk-reducing surgery and extra breast screening. \"Though Angelina decided that a preventative mastectomy was the right choice for her this may not be the case for another woman in a similar situation. \"We urge anyone who is worried about their risk of breast cancer to talk it through with their doctor.\"",

    "text": "By Hannah RitchieOxford Martin School This often forms part of a bid to become healthier, reduce their environmental impact, or consider animal welfare. A third of Britons claim to have either stopped eating meat or reduced it, while two thirds of those in the US say they are eating less of at least one meat. This trend is partly thanks to initiatives such as Meat-free Mondays and Veganuary. At the same time, a number of documentaries and high-profile advocates of veganism have highlighted the potential benefits of eating less meat. But have these sentiments had any effect on the ground? Rising incomes What we do know is that global meat consumption has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. Meat production today is nearly five times higher than in the early 1960s - from 70 million tonnes to more than 330 million tonnes in 2017. A big reason for this is that there are many more people to feed. Over that period the world population more than doubled. In the early 1960s there were around three billion of us, and today there are more than 7.6 billion. While population is part of the story, it doesn't entirely account for why meat production increased five-fold. Another key factor is rising incomes. Around the world, people have become richer, with the global average income more than tripling in half a century. When we compare consumption across different countries we see that, typically, the richer we are the more meat we eat. There are not just more people in the world - there are more people who can afford to eat meat. Who eats the most meat? We see a clear link with wealth when looking at patterns of meat consumption across the world. In 2013, the most recent year available, the US and Australia topped the tables for annual meat consumption. Alongside New Zealand and Argentina, both countries topped more than 100kg per person, the equivalent to about 50 chickens or half a cow each. In fact, high levels of meat consumption can be seen across the West, with most countries in Western Europe consuming between 80 and 90 kilograms of meat per person. At the other end of the spectrum, many of the world's poorest countries eat very little meat. The average Ethiopian consumes just 7kg, Rwandans 8kg and Nigerians 9kg. This is 10 times less than the average European. For those in low-income countries, meat is still very much a luxury. These figures represent the amount of meat per head available for consumption, but do not account for any food wasted at home or on the shop floor. In reality, people eat slightly less meat than this, but it's still a close estimate. Middle-income countries driving the demand for meat It is clear that the richest countries eat a lot of meat, and those on low incomes eat little. This has been the case for 50 years or more. So why are we collectively eating so much more meat? This trend has been largely driven from a growing band of middle-income countries. Rapidly growing nations like China and Brazil have seen significant economic growth in recent decades, and a large rise in meat consumption. In Kenya, meat consumption has changed little since 1960. By contrast, the average person in 1960s China consumed less than 5kg a year. By the late 1980s this had risen to 20kg, and in the last few decades this has more than tripled to over 60kg. The same thing happened in Brazil, where meat consumption has almost doubled since 1990 - overtaking almost all Western countries in the process. India is one notable exception. While average incomes have tripled since 1990, meat consumption hasn't followed suit. It is a misconception that the majority of India is vegetarian - two thirds of Indians do eat at least some meat, according to a nationwide survey. Nonetheless, the amount of meat consumed in India has remained small. At less than 4kg per person, it is the lowest in the world. This is likely to be partly down to cultural factors for some in India, including not eating certain types of meat for religious reasons. Is meat consumption falling in the West? Many in Europe and North America say they are trying to cut down on meat, but is it working? Not really, according to statistics. Recent data from the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) suggests meat consumption per head has actually increased over the last few years. While we may think that meat is becoming less popular, US consumption in 2018 was close to its highest in decades. It's a similar picture with meat consumption in the EU. While Western consumption of meat is steady, or slightly increasing, the types of meat eaten are changing. This means less red meat - beef and pork - and more poultry. In the US, poultry now accounts for half of meat consumption, up from a quarter in the 1970s. These types of substitution could be good news for health and the environment. More stories like this The impact of meat In some circumstances, eating meat can be beneficial. Moderate quantities of meat and dairy can improve people's health, particularly in lower-income countries where diets may lack variety. But in many countries, meat consumption goes far beyond basic nutritional benefits. In fact, it could be a health risk. Studies have linked excess red and processed meat consumption with increased risk of heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer. Substituting chicken for beef or bacon could be a positive step. This swap is also better for the environment as cows, in particular, are inefficient converters of feed to meat. Compared to chicken, beef has anywhere in the range of three to 10 times as much impact on land use, water and greenhouse gas emissions. Pork is somewhere in between the two. A future where meat consumption is sustainable and balanced across countries would require major changes. This would mean not only a shift in the types of meat we eat, but also how much. Essentially, meat would have to become more of a luxury again. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

The attacks, in January and February this year, were confirmed by CBS News. Hackers targeted a contractor linked to a US military organisation that conducts research and development for submarines and underwater weaponry. In a separate development, a former US intelligence officer was convicted on charges of giving top-secret documents to a Chinese agent. Kevin Mallory, 61, was found guilty under the federal Espionage Act on Friday. He is due to be charged on 21 September and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, the US justice department said in a statement. In the case of the US Navy contractor, US officials told the Washington Post that the firm had been working for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, a military organisation based in Newport, Rhode Island. They added that among the material accessed were data relating to a project known as Sea Dragon, as well as information held within the navy submarine development unit's electronic warfare library. Plans included an anti-ship missile system to be installed on US submarines by 2020. While the data was stored on an unclassified network belonging to the contractor, it is considered highly sensitive due to the nature of the technology under development and the links to military projects. A commander of the US Navy, Bill Speaks, said that measures were in place requiring companies to notify the government when a \"cyber incident\" had occurred on networks that contained \"controlled unclassified information\". \"It would be inappropriate to discuss further details at this time,\" he added. The investigation is being led by the Navy with the assistance of the FBI, officials said. On Friday, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis ordered a review into possible cybersecurity issues relating to the contractor, CBS News reports, citing the Pentagon inspector general's office.

    "text": "By Ian WestbrookHealth reporter, BBC News Tests showed stiffening of the arteries had begun by this relatively young age. These physical changes have been linked with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems, such as stroke and heart attack, in later life. But the study also found that the arteries of teenagers who stopped smoking or drinking returned to normal. The researchers studied data between 2004 and 2008 from 1,266 youngsters taking part in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which charts the health of 14,500 families in the Bristol area. The study has been published in the European Heart Journal. The participants detailed their smoking and drinking habits at the ages of 13, 15 and 17 and tests were then done to discover if there had been any stiffening of their arteries. They had to report facts including: Those who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes or tended to binge drink had a higher incidence of stiffened arteries than those who had smoked fewer than 20 cigarettes or had fewer than two drinks per day. The report's senior author, Prof John Deanfield, from the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: \"We found that in this large contemporary British cohort, drinking and smoking in adolescence, even at lower levels compared to those reported in adult studies, is associated with arterial stiffening and atherosclerosis progression. \"However, we also found that if teenagers stopped smoking and drinking during adolescence, their arteries returned to normal - suggesting that there are opportunities to preserve arterial health from a young age.\" Dr Marietta Charakida, who carried out the research at the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: \"Injury to the blood vessels occurs very early in life as a result of smoking and drinking and the two together are even more damaging. \"Although studies have shown teenagers are smoking less in recent years, our findings indicated approximately one in five teenagers were smoking by the age of 17. \"In families where parents were smokers, teenagers were more likely to smoke.\" Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research, told the BBC that the fact damage could be reversed was an \"encouraging indication\". He said: \"It's never too late to make changes that may literally end up saving your life. \"This study suggests that the damage to arteries can occur even in the young, leading to serious trouble later on in life. \"Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do to protect your heart. \"If you do drink, try to ensure that it's not to excess and within the recommended guidelines.\"",

Interestingly, the credit for this strategic alliance is being credited to Priyanka Gandhi, sister of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. 'Relevant dynasty' Many in the party have fancied a larger role for Ms Gandhi for years, but this is perhaps the first time her backroom negotiating skills are being acknowledged publicly by the party. In the family stronghold of Rae Bareli district in Uttar Pradesh, Ms Gandhi is held in high regard. \"If anyone in India can revive the Congress and ensure the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty remains relevant, it's Priyanka,\" declares Bhure Lal, 43-year-old farmer and Congress party loyalist. Rae Bareli is represented in parliament by her mother Sonia Gandhi, Congress party chief and widow of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, and over the past 16 years, Ms Gandhi has campaigned extensively for her mother and her brother Rahul Gandhi in the nearby constituency of Amethi. The Gandhi family has enjoyed cult status in these underdeveloped areas where her father Rajiv and grandmother, former PM Indira Gandhi, also won several elections. In the 2014 elections, covering village after village in the blistering heat of northern India, Ms Gandhi was a hit with the masses, often sharing her home-cooked meals with people. Setbacks On the campaign trail, she is often seen skipping her security cordon to talk to supporters, giving jitters to the security men, considering both her father and grandmother were assassinated. \"One day, after a long day of election campaign, she returned to her makeshift home in Rae Bareli and leaving her security men bewildered, decided to take her children out on a rickshaw ride in the town,\" recalls veteran journalist Umesh Raghuvanshi. In recent years, the Congress has suffered several electoral setbacks - the party was reduced from 206 to 44 seats in the 543-member parliament in the 2014 general elections and also lost in the crucial states of Assam, Kerala and West Bengal, where both Rahul and the Italian-born Sonia had campaigned aggressively. This has led to demands within the party to bring Priyanka, perceived by many to be more popular than her bachelor brother, to the forefront. But the 44-year-old mother-of-two has been reluctant to take centre stage and prefers to work only in the family bastions. Mood of voters In Amethi, which her brother has represented as an MP since 2004, Ms Gandhi has kept close tabs on the mood of the voters. During the 2014 polls, when Mr Gandhi was busy campaigning for Congress candidates elsewhere, it was she who is credited with ensuring the defeat of his opponent Smriti Irani, television actress and now a cabinet minister. \"Had it not been for her, Rahul Gandhi would have lost. Sensing her brother was losing popularity, Priyanka devoted extra time to the constituency, reminding people of the sacrifices her family had made for the country. Rahul won but his victory margin decreased considerably and that was embarrassing,\" says Lal Bahadur Khan, a Congress supporter in Amethi. Those who have worked closely with her praise the easy connections she makes with the masses. \"Her biggest asset is the instant connect she makes with the voter and her fluency in Hindi. She makes people feel as if they are interacting with the person next door,\" says Sanjay Singh, a former Amethi royal and MP. Ms Gandhi had previously displayed no political ambition and always endorsed her bother as the one who has political insight, dedication and conviction to run the party. 'Active politics' \"I don't think I would be able to have a normal quiet life if I was in active politics. When I am not helping my mother or brother in their constituencies, I am making cupcakes for my two kids and buying groceries,\" she told Outlook magazine in a rare interview. But now, she has been officially listed as one of the political campaigners for the Congress party in this election. And although Ms Gandhi has insisted that she has no political ambitions, many are unconvinced that her family will stay away from politics. Her flashy and flamboyant husband Robert Vadra has hinted in the past that he is not averse to entering politics. 'Witch hunt' He has been accused of wrongdoing in his real estate business in the states of Haryana and Rajasthan and is being investigated by the BJP government in Haryana. Mr Vadra and the Gandhis have denied the allegations and accuse the BJP of a \"political witch hunt\". Some, however, say it will take much more than the charms of Ms Gandhi to stall the Congress party's slide. They also wonder if she has the political acumen and flair to lead the party. A long-time Congress worker and local party administrator in Rae Bareli, Ram Sevak Chaudhary, says she may be the \"best bet\" to revive the floundering party, but \"she is mostly surrounded by sycophants\". \"When we lost the 2012 state polls, she asked me the reasons for the loss. I bluntly told her that the faulty candidate selection by her team was one of the reasons. She looked visibly upset and I was thrown out of the local organisational set-up the following month,\" he says. 'Never too late' Critics also say that with the Congress losing ground fast, the party must take a call on launching Ms Gandhi before it's too late. But between the raging debate of \"will she or won't she\" lies the traumatic experience of a young girl who saw her father and grandmother being killed while on political duty. So despite being the biggest crowd-puller amongst the Gandhis currently, it may be a completely emotional decision if she ever decided to join politics, says analyst Rasheed Kidwai. \"Sonia Gandhi is ageing and it's clear that she wants to pass on the mantle to Rahul Gandhi who appears to be a bit unsure. Even Priyanka hasn't delivered phenomenally in the Gandhi strongholds of late, but who knows… It is never too late in politics.\"",

    "text": "The two sides had discussed holding talks to resolve the Qatar crisis, which has seen Doha cut off from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. However, Saudi Arabia then accused Qatar of distorting facts about the call, and said it was ending talks. The four countries say Qatar supports terrorism - something Doha denies. The row led to all four Arab nations cutting ties with Qatar on 5 June - Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, while all four countries cut air and sea links with the country. Friday's phone call, which came after US President Donald Trump spoke separately with both sides, had initially been seen as a possible breakthrough in the crisis. The call was the first formal contact between Riyadh and Doha since the crisis began. State media on both sides reported that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had discussed the need for dialogue to resolve the crisis. Who said what? The Saudi Press Agency said Qatar's leader had \"expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries\", and that further details would be announced after Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. Meanwhile, the Qatar News Agency said the Saudi crown prince had proposed assigning \"two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of states\". Shortly afterwards, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of not being \"serious\" about dialogue, and said communications between the two sides would be suspended. The row appears to be over protocol - observers say Saudi Arabia is angered that Qatari state media did not make clear that the call was initiated by Doha. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, who are blockading Qatar, have presented a list of conditions for the lifting of sanctions. They include the closure of news broadcaster Al-Jazeera and reducing ties with Iran. The group accuses the Qatari-funded channel of fostering extremism, a charge the network denies. Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait and backed by Western powers have so far failed to end the dispute. On Friday, Mr Trump spoke with both sides, and the UAE, in an attempt to broker talks. \"The president underscored that unity among the United States' Arab partners is essential to promoting regional stability and countering the threat of Iran,\" the White House said in a statement. It added that \"all countries must follow through on commitments... to defeat terrorism, cut off funding for terrorist groups and combat extremist ideology\".",

    "text": "She denied false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm after the son, now aged about 40, was found injured and living in squalor. It seems he was only discovered by a relative on Sunday after his mother fell ill and was taken to hospital. He is now undergoing surgery in hospital for his injuries. Police have sealed off the apartment in Haninge, a southern suburb of the capital, to conduct their investigation and are seeking witnesses as they try to piece together what happened. The woman, who is aged 70, is expected to remain in police custody while the investigation continues. If she is found guilty of false imprisonment, police say she could face up to ten years in jail. How was the son found? The relative who discovered the son said she was his sister and had gone to the flat on Sunday evening with her partner after hearing that the mother was in hospital, she told Swedish media. She told Swedish broadcaster SVT she had moved out of the apartment when she was a teenager and had not seen her brother since. As a child, she said, she had tried in vain to raise the alarm over the welfare of the child, who had been removed from school when he was aged 11 or 12. Opening the unlocked door, she said she found the flat in darkness and reeking of urine, decay, dirt and dust. There was no answer when she shouted \"hello\" so she went in, picking her way through mounds of clutter. Hearing a sound from the kitchen, she saw the man sitting in a dark corner, lit by a lamp on the street outside. Sores covered his legs up to his knees. When he saw her, he stood up and whispered her name again and again. He had lost almost all his teeth and his voice was slurred, she told the paper. Somehow, she said, he had recognised her after all the time that had passed and he was not afraid of her. When the man was taken to hospital, doctors alerted the police and the mother was detained. Stockholm prosecutor Emma Olsson told Reuters news agency the man had required surgery, without giving further details. \"The only comment on the time that person has been kind of 'imprisoned' by his mother is: we are sure that it has been for a long period of time,\" police spokesperson Ola Österling told BBC News. \"We don't estimate how many years. That's a part of our investigations now, to get the detailed information about the exact amount of time.\" What do we know of the relationship? Earlier, SVT quoted the relative - who was not immediately identified as the sister - as saying the mother had felt bad about losing an earlier child at a young age. When she gave birth again, her new son was given the same name. She wanted her dead son back and became over-protective. \"I'm just thankful that he got help and is going to survive,\" the relative told Expressen.

    "text": "By Beth RoseBBC News Her partner Andrew Wilde was halfway up a mountain in the US state of Montana when he received a baffling text from Hannah. He understood only two words - \"dog\" and \"hospital\" - but knew instinctively something was wrong. The text was in German, a language Hannah had grown up with, but Andrew didn't really understand. They only ever communicated in English. Hannah had stayed at home in the UK, running the dog-training business she'd set up in Wokingham, Berkshire, while Andrew had gone to the US to train for an international shooting competition. He called Hannah's mobile number, but got no response. With growing unease, he started to phone hospitals around Berkshire but couldn't get any information. He knew he needed to get home. He made his way to the airport, unsure of what would be waiting for him when he returned. What he didn't expect to find, was a different Hannah to the one he'd kissed goodbye days earlier. Hannah had been cycling through a park near their home the day before she sent the text to Andrew. She'd rounded a familiar corner and collided with another cyclist. She remembers little, but paramedics have since filled her in - the other cyclist saw her lying motionless and bleeding on the ground and called emergency services. He waited for help to arrive, told them he'd been cycling no faster than 32km/h (20mph), then left, without giving any more information. An air ambulance was called for Hannah, who had been identified from items in her wallet. It was touch and go whether she would survive. Listen to the podcast: The bike crash which made me forget English A full transcript is available here. For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast. Hannah eventually came to on a busy ward in the Royal Berkshire Hospital with no idea where she was, what had happened or why, in her mind, no-one spoke English. \"I couldn't understand anything,\" she says. \"I felt as though I'd woken up in a foreign country and I couldn't understand why people weren't speaking to me in a way that I could understand.\" Doctors tended to her in this unfamiliar language. Finally she recognised what she thought was \"name\" and \"date of birth\" - and recited that to anyone who approached. It seemed like the right thing to do. The doctors were puzzled as Hannah's documents all pointed to the fact she lived and worked in the UK. They knew she was called Hannah Jenkins, and yet she didn't understand or respond to English. They contacted her next of kin, her sister Margaret, who asked to speak to Hannah. As Hannah sat in her hospital bed she chatted away on the phone, relieved that she was finally able to communicate with someone. This bemused doctors, because previously she had only uttered the odd, indecipherable word. Hannah had so many questions for Margaret, one of them being why the doctors weren't speaking to her in English. \"They are, Hannah,\" her sister replied. The crash, it seemed, had knocked Hannah's knowledge of English clear out of her mind. But she was left with the German that she had learnt as a child - the language that she defaulted to when speaking to her sister. \"The doctors didn't know I could speak German,\" Hannah explains. \"It wasn't until they spoke to my sister that they realised.\" The sisters were brought up in the UK speaking German and English, by polyglot parents. Their Austrian mother spoke four languages and their father, a language teacher from Wales, spoke seven. \"German was my first oral language,\" says Hannah. \"It was a rule we had in my house - that when we speak to my family it's always in German, just to keep the language fresh in our heads. \"I couldn't get my head around the fact that in the hospital they were speaking English. My brain had lost my ability to understand that.\" Hannah was experiencing something called secondary language loss, according to consultant neurosurgeon Colin Shieff, who is also trustee of brain injury charity Headway. \"Our brains are very sensitive and anything that has the ability to disturb the computer in any way can potentially impact upon the words coming out,\" he says. \"There is no algorithm that would follow that a specific injury will invariably result in the loss of German nouns or English grammar, but we do lose those bits.\" He says the skills learned in childhood are those most likely to be retained - the ability to say \"yes\" or \"no\" or even to repeat a nursery rhyme. He says \"something that's been ingrained for ever\" - is more likely to remain intact and those skills learned later, are the first to go. Why did Hannah lose her speech? Information from the brain injury charity, Headway The physical impact of the crash was minimal - a bruised leg and a sore shoulder - so Hannah was discharged within days. But via her sister, who acted as her translator, she learnt that her brain injury was significant and would take years, rather than months, to improve. She went home and waited for Andrew. \"I was listening to the radio a lot,\" she says. \"I don't know how much I understood, but when my partner came that's when I learned how badly the language was affected.\" The couple had been together for eight years, but now Hannah couldn't understand Andrew - and his school German only got him so far. They devised hand signals and their own version of sign language. As time went on, Hannah's written English improved quicker than the speaking. \"When the communication really broke, we did resort to writing stuff down and texting or emailing each other, even though we were in the same room,\" she says. \"My relationship with Andrew has been affected because you can't not talk to each other just because you're tired or under pressure. \"Having that patience for the situation is always a little bit of a struggle. But I certainly couldn't have done it without him.\" Andrew took an 18-month sabbatical from his job to support Hannah. Slowly she regained much of her English language, but it's something that even now, three years on, has not returned completely. It has now become her second language. \"I'm fine in the mornings, but by the afternoon the fatigue really kicks in and I switch in my mind to thinking in German. \"I'll write little notes to myself in German, and I just sort of almost power down that part of my brain that deals with communication, so that in the evening when my partner's back I can communicate again.\" The couple also had to come to terms with the fact that Hannah's personality would be likely to change as a result of the crash. She was told she \"might not be the same person post-accident\". \"I think that's the hardest part to get your head around,\" she says. \"It's almost like you have to go through a bereavement process to say goodbye to the old you, before you can get to know the new you. \"But there is that level of resentment there to start with. I was fighting that quite a lot and saying, 'No, I'm still me, don't be silly, this is who I always am'.\" Hannah has recognised a few \"subtle changes\" in her personality - she's not as patient as she once was - something that led her to close her business. \"I forgot so much of the theory behind it, my reactions are a lot slower and I don't have the subtlety of language that you need when you have to tell people that this isn't the right dog for them.\" She has taken up photography and art, something she studied at university, and has thrown herself into a new sport to improve her focus - shooting. \"Shooting has been described as skilled meditation, and I think that is very true because you have to focus completely on what you're doing. If your brain goes off and ruminates or meanders then your shots do the same. \"To start with I could only do it for about 20 minutes, and now I'm up to about an hour-and-a-half.\" The crash on an October afternoon in 2015 altered Hannah's life, language and personality, but it is something to which she has learned to adapt. \"Mentally I have to see that this is me now,\" she says. \"I'm happy in my own skin again. So there's no reason why I can't just run with life as I am now.\" Illustrations by Katie Horwich For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast.",

    "text": "Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving. The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high. Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been \"cynical\" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU. Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was \"cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge\". \"I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,\" he said. Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was \"no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing\" and the situation was \"completely out of control\". He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people \"kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration\". Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures \"could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase\". Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on \"sham marriages\", would \"close back-door routes\" into the country. \"Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,\" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would \"wreck the economy and harm jobs\". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU: According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014. The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the \"tens of thousands\" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year. A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would \"continue to look at what more might be done\". The spokesman added: \"Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.\" He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying \"they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas\". Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015. They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014. The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating. Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show \"mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders\". But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a \"fortress Britain\" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying \"We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy.\" He added: \"40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.\" The Institute of Directors said the public was \"being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration\" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of \"best performing economies in Europe\". \"Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,\" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.

    "text": "The directive from the Gulf kingdom's Supreme Court says flogging will be replaced by imprisonment or fines. It says this is an extension of human rights reforms brought by King Salman and his son, the country's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia has been criticised over the jailing of dissidents, and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Campaigners say Saudi Arabia has one of the worst records for human rights in the world, with freedom of expression severely curtailed and critics of the government subject to what they say is arbitrary arrest. 'Bad image' The last time that flogging in Saudi Arabia hit the headlines was in 2015 when blogger Raif Badawi was subjected to the punishment in public, reportedly after being convicted of cybercrime and insulting Islam. He had been due to receive 1,000 lashes in weekly beatings but global outrage and reports that he nearly died put a stop to that part of his sentence. BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says it was clearly bad for Saudi Arabia's image. Now, the practice looks like it will be done away with entirely. But waves of arrests of every type of dissident under the king and the crown prince - including of women's rights campaigners - undercut this claim, our reporter says. Earlier on Friday, the most prominent Saudi human rights campaigner died in jail after a stroke which fellow activists say was due to medical neglect by the authorities.",

    "text": "Garcia Marquez was considered one of the greatest Spanish-language authors, best known for his masterpiece of magical realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude. The 1967 novel sold more than 30 million copies and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982. Garcia Marquez had been ill and had made few public appearances recently. He achieved fame for pioneering magical realism, a unique blending of the marvellous and the mundane in a way that made the extraordinary seem routine. With his books, he brought Latin America's charm and teaming contradictions to life in the minds of millions of people. 'Greatest Colombian' \"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has died,\" a spokeswoman for the family, Fernanda Familiar, said on Twitter. \"[His wife] Mercedes and her sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo, have authorised me to provide the information. Such deep sadness,\" she added. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos also took to Twitter to pay tribute to the author. \"One Hundred Years of Solitude and sadness for the death of the greatest Colombian of all time,\" he wrote. US President Barack Obama said the world had \"lost one of its greatest visionary writers - and one of my favourites from the time I was young\". Former US President Bill Clinton also said: \"I was always amazed by his unique gifts of imagination, clarity of thought, and emotional honesty. I was honoured to be his friend and to know his great heart and brilliant mind for more than 20 years.\" Poor health The cause of Garcia Marquez's death was not immediately known but he was recently hospitalised for a lung and urinary tract infection in Mexico City. He was sent home last week but his health was said to be \"very fragile\" because of his age. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says his loss will be particularly felt in his native Colombia but in Mexico too, which for more than 30 years became his adopted home. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted: \"On behalf of Mexico, I express sorrow over the death of one of the greatest writers of our time.\" Colombian pop star Shakira said \"Gabo\", as the author was affectionately known, would \"always be in my heart\". \"Your life, dear Gabo, will be remembered by all of us as a unique and singular gift,\" the singer said. Peruvian Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa called him a \"great writer\". \"His works gave literature great reach and prestige. His novels will survive and will continue to find new readers everywhere,\" he told Peruvian media. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's other works include Love in the Time of Cholera, Chronicle of a Death Foretold and The General in His Labyrinth. Controversy The novelist was also an accomplished journalist whose reporting shone in his work News of a Kidnapping. The non-fiction book recounted high-profile abductions by the Medellin drug cartel run by Pablo Escobar, a notorious Colombian drug lord who died in 1993. The novelist was at times a political figure too. His friendship with the former Cuban President Fidel Castro sparked some controversy among literary and political circles in Latin America. But he insisted their friendship was based on books. \"Fidel is a very cultured man,\" he said in an interview. \"When we're together we talk about literature.\" Unlike other authors in the region, his work transcended Latin America with One Hundred Years of Solitude, which was translated into more than 30 languages. The Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda called the novel \"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since Don Quixote\", the 17th-century masterpiece by Spain's Miguel de Cervantes.",

    "text": "The conservative leader said the action sabotages any chance of enacting cross-party reforms and damages the presidency itself. Mr Obama's plan means more than 4m illegal immigrants in the US will be allowed to apply for work permits. Speaking in Las Vegas on Friday, the president said he had no choice. \"We're not giving up,\" he said. \"We're going to keep on working with members of Congress to make permanent reform a reality.\" But until that day, he said, he will take actions within his powers to make the system \"more fair and more just\". Earlier, Mr Boehner said the plan would encourage more people to arrive unlawfully. \"We have a broken immigration system and the American people expect us to work together to fix it,\" Mr Boehner told reporters on Friday, saying Mr Obama had acted unilaterally \"like a king or emperor\" and not through a democratic process. Astrid's moment \"The action by the president yesterday will only encourage more people to come here illegally,\" Mr Boehner said. \"[It] also punishes those who have obeyed the law and waited their turn.\" The Republican leader said Mr Obama's actions fail to to take into account the wishes of the American people, adding it is not the first time the US leader has acted without the consent of Congress. \"All year long I have warned the president that by taking unilateral action on matters such as his healthcare law or by threatening action repeatedly on immigration, he was making it impossible to build the trust necessary to work together,\" Mr Boehner said. The same day, House Republicans filed a federal suit over the legality of parts of Mr Obama's signature healthcare reform law, nicknamed Obamacare. Analysis: Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor How has the immigration debate in the United States become so polarised, so toxic, so unpleasant? That it has cannot be doubted. Barack Obama says he has grown so weary of trying to get Congress to engage seriously that he is going it alone. He's bypassing the legislature and brandishing his big stick - the executive action. It is governance by diktat. And the reaction of his opponents suggests it will spark an atmosphere of retaliation and revenge. How did immigration debate get so toxic? Under Mr Obama's new immigration plan, undocumented parents of children who are US citizens or permanent legal residents will be able to apply for work permits lasting three years. There are estimated to be 11 million illegal immigrants in the US. More than 4m of them are expected to benefit from the reform package forced through using executive orders, which allow Mr Obama to bypass Congress. Only parents who have lived in the US for five years will qualify. Some 3.7 million people are thought to be eligible for this scheme, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Another part of the package will extend a programme that gives temporary legal status to people who arrived in the US as children. Currently only those under the age of 30 who arrived before 2007 can apply for the programme, which was launched in 2012 and already covers roughly 1.2 million people. Mr Obama has abolished the age limit and extended the cut-off point to 2010, potentially extending the programme to a further 300,000 people. The US leader said in a televised address that his measures would allow illegal immigrants to \"come out of the shadows and get right with the law\". He insisted that his proposals, which are the biggest immigration reforms since the mid-1980s, did not amount to an amnesty. \"What I'm describing is accountability - a common-sense, middle ground approach,\" he said. Mr Obama's plan does not go as far as an immigration bill that failed to pass Congress last year. The bill was supported by the Democrat-led Senate, but the Republican-controlled House of Representatives refused to debate the proposal. The vast majority of illegal immigrants in the US come from Mexico, according to figures supplied by Homeland Security. They made up 59% of undocumented people in 2012, followed by El Salvador (6%), Guatemala (5%), then Honduras and Philippines (3%).",

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News A team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \"light enough to see across\" at night. However, they caution there is not enough evidence to advise people to buy thicker curtains or turn off lights. The study of 113,000 women was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. The women were asked to rate the amount of light in their bedrooms at night as: Their answers were compared to several measures of obesity. Body Mass Index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference were all higher in women with lighter rooms. Prof Anthony Swerdlow, from the Institute of Cancer Research, told the BBC: \"In this very large group of people there is an association between reported light exposure at night and overweight and obesity. \"But there is not sufficient evidence to know if making your room darker would make any difference to your weight. \"There might be other explanations for the association, but the findings are intriguing enough to warrant further scientific investigation.\" Body Clock One possible explanation is that the light is disrupting the body clock, which stems from our evolutionary past when we were active when it was light in the day and resting when it was dark at night. Light alters mood, physical strength and even the way we process food in a 24-hour cycle. Artificial light is known to disrupt the body clock by delaying the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, from the Surrey Sleep Centre, said there would be no harm in trying to make bedrooms darker. He told the BBC: \"People in general are not aware of the light present in their bedroom, I think people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker.\" Street lights, some alarm clocks and standby lights on electrical equipment such as televisions could light a room, he said. \"Overall this study points to the importance of darkness,\" he concluded. Cancer The study was funded by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and the findings emerged from a long-term study to understand the risk factors for breast cancer. Obesity is known to increase the odds of the disease. Dr Matthew Lam, from the charity, commented: \"It's too early to suggest that sleeping in the dark will help prevent obesity, a known risk factor for breast cancer, but the association is certainly interesting. \"Whilst we are learning more and more each day about the environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that affect breast cancer risk, it is not yet possible to predict who will get breast cancer, and for women who have been diagnosed with the disease, we can't yet say what caused it.\"",

    "text": "By Catrin NyeVictoria Derbyshire programme \"You can never truly understand how painful something like that is until it actually happens,\" Dave Henson tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. He was blown up by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan in 2011, and remembers the experience vividly. \"There was a lot of fear. When you're lying there on the ground and a certain amount of blood has been chucked out of your body - the cold that sets in is quite terrifying. That sort of thing you can never prepare for.\" Mr Henson served as a captain in the British army. He struggles to comprehend the effect a bomb blast would have on a child - especially those too young to understand what is going on. \"I just can't imagine the fear that is instilled in a child at that moment,\" he says. Bombardments continue to cause both personal and structural devastation in countries such as Afghanistan and Syria. Until now, most training and techniques available to war-zone medical staff have focused on treating adults - leaving them struggling to provide children with the special type of care they need. This is despite the United Nations estimating that there have been more than 20,000 child deaths since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 from all causes - including blasts. Dr Murhaf - one of the few surgeons left working in Idlib province in Syria - describes living in that region as \"chaos\", and akin to \"hell\". It is the last rebel-held province of the country opposed to President Assad, and is currently being bombarded by Russian and Syrian government forces. There are also constant ground battles. \"I have a little daughter, and when I see every child I think of her,\" he says. \"We need to learn more and more about surgery for children.\" Now that help may be coming. A manual has been developed to help medics, including Dr Murhaf, tailor their care for children. It is being taught just over the border in Reyhanli, Turkey, within a specialist centre at which 7,000 Syrian victims of bombs, mines, and shrapnel have been treated since the outbreak of the war - including many children. One of them is seven-year-old \"Saed\", whose name we have changed. When he was just 18 months old he was in a car with his family, trying to flee aerial bombardment in Aleppo. He was sitting on his mum's lap when an air strike landed so close to their car that shrapnel pierced the whole vehicle. He needed both his legs amputated. His sister was killed. Saed now wears prosthetics, and is currently undergoing an adjustment for a newly constructed socket for his limb, the clinic's medical director, Dr Malik, explains. \"He needs to have an adjustment to the limb every year or one-and-a-half years, because the bone will keep growing,\" he says. \"They will cut open the amputation - adjust the bone length and then sew it out again.\" These continued operations are crucial to Saed's rehabilitation - but without specialist understanding of the needs of children, it is something that could be easily missed. It is why war medics requested the manual and why they believe it could be crucial. The guide has been designed and written by charity Save the Children and scientists at Imperial College London in the UK - including Dr Emily Meyhew. She explains how \"people with incredible experience in treating and saving lives of blast casualties can fall apart when confronted with a blast-injured child.\" \"So we want to be able to help them get across that first moment of panic, the first moment of fear, the first moment of worry,\" she says. 'My family is proud' \"Abdel\" - not his real name - was just nine when he lost a leg in an air strike in Syria. He remembers hearing a very loud sound, and that for three or four minutes he \"didn't feel anything at all\". When he opened his eyes, he saw others around him who had lost both arms and both legs. Others were dead. His leg had to be amputated. Now he wears his prosthetic proudly outside, but for a long time the incident left deep scars - and left him afraid to go out. \"I initially didn't adapt well to this situation,\" he says, \"[but now] my family is very proud.\" It is hoped the guide will play a role in the recovery and development of children like Abdel, both psychologically and physically. Those behind it are already looking to roll it out to other war zones in future, including Afghanistan. For Dave Henson, who has since gone on to compete in the Paralympics and is involved in research on improving prosthetics, the more knowledge medics have, the better. Having been in the Army in Afghanistan, his military training had prepared him for the possibility of being blown up. But he says that for a child injured by a bomb, it would be much worse. \"[As a child] you have no understanding of what has happened, probably no understanding of what a blast injury is. \"And yet suddenly they find themselves on the ground with blood everywhere, bits missing and just an extraordinary amount of pain. \"We know from our experience that you can have rehab and you can recover from the injuries themselves - but it's the fear of the unknown that comes with it that I hate thinking about so much.\" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.",

YouTube has stolen Facebook's former dominance over teens, with 85% of them preferring the video-sharing platform.

The numbers of teens who use Twitter (32%) and Tumblr (14%) are largely unchanged compared to the results found in 2015.

Today's 95% is a 22-point increase from the 73% of teens three years ago. It also found, consistent with previous studies, that while most teens used the same social media platforms as their peers, low-income teens were more likely to prefer Facebook than teens from a higher-income household. The Pew survey could not find clear consensus among teens about the effects of social media on their lives. Almost a third described the effect as mostly positive, and a quarter saying mostly negative. The largest bloc, 45%, said that the effect was neither positive nor negative.",

    "text": "By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The study says that bees, ants and beetles are disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles. But researchers say that some species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, are likely to boom. The general insect decline is being caused by intensive agriculture, pesticides and climate change. Insects make up the majority of creatures that live on land, and provide key benefits to many other species, including humans. They provide food for birds, bats and small mammals; they pollinate around 75% of the crops in the world; they replenish soils and keep pest numbers in check. Many other studies in recent years have shown that individual species of insects, such as bees, have suffered huge declines, particularly in developed economies. But this new paper takes a broader look. Published in the journal Biological Conservation, it reviews 73 existing studies from around the world published over the past13 years. The researchers found that declines in almost all regions may lead to the extinction of 40% of insects over the next few decades. One-third of insect species are classed as Endangered. \"The main factor is the loss of habitat, due to agricultural practices, urbanisation and deforestation,\" lead author Dr Francisco Sánchez-Bayo, from the University of Sydney, told BBC News. \"Second is the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture worldwide and contamination with chemical pollutants of all kinds. Thirdly, we have biological factors, such as invasive species and pathogens; and fourthly, we have climate change, particularly in tropical areas where it is known to have a big impact.\" Some of the highlights of study include the recent, rapid decline of flying insects in Germany, and the massive drop in numbers in tropical forests in Puerto Rico, linked to rising global temperatures. Other experts say the findings are \"gravely sobering\". \"It's not just about bees, or even about pollination and feeding ourselves - the declines also include dung beetles that recycle waste and insects like dragonflies that start life in rivers and ponds,\" said Matt Shardlow from UK campaigners Buglife. \"It is becoming increasingly obvious our planet's ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends. Allowing the slow eradication of insect life to continue is not a rational option.\" Pests on the rise The authors are concerned about the impact of insect decline up along the food chain. With many species of birds, reptiles and fish depending on insects as their main food source, it's likely that these species may also be wiped out as a result. While some of our most important insect species are in retreat, the review also finds that a small number of species are likely to be able to adapt to changing conditions and do well. \"Fast-breeding pest insects will probably thrive because of the warmer conditions, because many of their natural enemies, which breed more slowly, will disappear, \" said Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex who was not involved in the review. \"It's quite plausible that we might end up with plagues of small numbers of pest insects, but we will lose all the wonderful ones that we want, like bees and hoverflies and butterflies and dung beetles that do a great job of disposing of animal waste.\" Prof Goulson said that some tough, adaptable, generalist species - like houseflies and cockroaches - seem to be able to live comfortably in a human-made environment and have evolved resistance to pesticides. He added that while the overall message was alarming, there were things that people could do, such as making their gardens more insect friendly, not using pesticides and buying organic food. More research is also badly needed as 99% of the evidence for insect decline comes from Europe and North America with almost nothing from Africa or South America. Ultimately, if huge numbers of insects disappear, they will be replaced but it will take a long, long time. \"If you look at what happened in the major extinctions of the past, they spawned massive adaptive radiations where the few species that made it through adapted and occupied all the available niches and evolved into new species,\" Prof Goulson told BBC News. \"So give it a million years and I've no doubt there will be a whole diversity of new creatures that will have popped up to replace the ones wiped out in the 20th and 21st centuries. \"Not much consolation for our children, I'm afraid.\"",

    "text": "The victims were fleeing fighting in the al-Durayhimi district, south of the port city of Hudaydah, when their vehicle was hit on Thursday. A separate air strike the same day killed four children, according to the UN's humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock. It comes just weeks after a strike on a bus killed over 40 children. The Saudi-led coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthi rebels, has yet to comment on the latest deaths. However, it responded to the news of the deadly bus attack in the northern province of Saada earlier this month by saying that its actions were \"legitimate\". It insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. What happened in Hudaydah? The first reports of the strike emerged in Houthi rebel media, which broadcast graphic footage of what it said were victims and aftermath of the strike late on Thursday. Mr Lowcock's statement on Friday confirmed that the victims had been fleeing violence around the rebel-held port city Hudaydah. He renewed calls for an impartial and independent investigation into air strikes. A report by Human Rights Watch the same day accused the Saudi-led coalition of failing to hold \"credible\" investigations into such incidents. The reported attack was condemned by Unicef, Save the Children and other international organisations. In June, Saudi-backed forces launched an operation to recapture Hudaydah, amid warnings from aid agencies of a humanitarian catastrophe. The port is the main entry point for aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen. What happened earlier this month? Deadly air strikes in Yemen are not uncommon, but the strike on a bus of children on an outing on 9 August drew particularly strong condemnation. The bus was parked at a market when it was hit, killing dozens. Rights groups have since criticised the role of governments who provide arms to Saudi Arabia, after CNN reported that the bomb used in the attack was supplied by the US. The coalition against the rebels receives logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has defended UK ties with Saudi Arabia, which he described as a \"very, very important military ally\". Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when Houthi rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.",

'Inadequate' The search engine says it does not control data, it only offers links to information freely available on the internet. It has previously said forcing it to remove data amounts to censorship. The EU Justice Commissioner, Viviane Reding, welcomed the court's decision in a post on Facebook, saying it was a \"clear victory for the protection of personal data of Europeans\". \"The ruling confirms the need to bring today's data protection rules from the \"digital stone age\" into today's modern computing world,\" she said. The European Commission proposed a law giving users the \"right to be forgotten\" in 2012. It would require search engines to edit some searches to make them compliant with the European directive on the protection of personal data. In its judgement on Tuesday, the court in Luxembourg said people had the right to request information be removed if it appeared to be \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\". A right to be forgotten? BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones says the ruling has huge consequences for anyone who publishes material online about individuals. It appears to say that anyone who does not like an old story about them can ask for it to be wiped away, he adds. The judgement stresses that the rights of the individual are paramount when it comes to their control over their personal data, although there is a public interest defence when it comes to people in public life. 'No legal oversight' The ruling came after Mario Costeja Gonzalez complained that a search of his name in Google brought up newspaper articles from 16 years ago about a sale of property to recover money he owed. He said the matter had been resolved and should no longer be linked to him. Campaign group Index on Censorship condemned the decision, saying it \"violates the fundamental principles of freedom of expression\". \"It allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight,\" it said. \"This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books.\" Mr Gonzalez's case is one of scores of similar cases in Spain whose complainants want Google to delete their personal information from their search results.

    "text": "On Friday, the kingdom will launch a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a \"historic moment\" for the country. Visas have until now largely been restricted to pilgrims, business people and expatriate workers. Saudi Arabia is also hoping to secure foreign investment in the tourism industry. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. \"Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share - five Unesco World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty,\" Mr Khateeb said. Foreign women visitors will not be required to wear the body-covering abaya robe required to be worn in public by Saudi women, but must still dress modestly. There will also be no restrictions on unaccompanied women visiting the country. \"We have a culture. We believe our friends and our guests will respect the culture, but definitely it is modest and it will be very clear,\" Mr Khateeb said. Non-Muslims will still not be allowed to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the ban on alcohol will be maintained. More details on the scheme, including which countries are eligible, are due to be provided later on Friday. But Mr Khateeb said he did not believe the recent attack on Saudi Arabia's oil industry would put people off visiting. \"Our cities are among the most safest cities globally. Therefore, we don't believe at all it will impact our plans. We have all the expats living in Saudi Arabia, enjoying Saudi Arabia. We're very secure,\" he said. The moves to open up tourism is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's wider economic reform programme that aims to reduce the kingdom's focus on oil. Under the plan, Saudi Arabia wants to increase international and domestic visits to 100 million a year by 2030. The government expects to create one million tourism jobs. Still, the push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. In 2017 Saudi Arabia announced a massive tourism development project that will turn 50 islands and other sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts. Last year construction began on Qiddiya \"entertainment city\" near Riyadh, which is to include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area. This is not the first time Saudi Arabia has opened its doors to tourism. In the summer of 2000 it hired French Alpine instructors from Chamonix to take visitors rock-climbing and paragliding in the mountainous southwestern province of Asir. I jumped off a cliff with one of them in a tandem flight that had us soaring on thermals for 45 minutes, hundreds of feet above juniper forests where wild Hamadryas baboons foraged amongst the rocks. But everything came to a grinding halt one year later after the 9/11 terrorist attacks involving, amongst others, 15 Saudi nationals. Since then, domestic and religious tourism have continued apace. Up to three million Muslims come to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina each year to make the Hajj pilgrimage. With the country's hot, arid climate, a lot of Saudis like to get away to the over-developed Red Sea coast or to the cool, verdant mountains of Asir. The views here are simply stunning. But it is still Saudi Arabia, so don't expect cocktails at sundown! Have you visited Saudi Arabia? Where did you visit and how was your experience?

    "text": "By William McCantsAuthor of The ISIS Apocalypse His family was known for its piety and his tribe claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad. As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him \"the Believer\" because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Baghdadi pursued his religious interests at university. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively. Until 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children. He taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club. During Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood. Baghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism. Activist to insurgent Within months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity). In February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months. While in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners. According to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled. Baghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004. After his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Impressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam. Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri. That October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda. The new emir Because of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks. He was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi. Baghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq. After the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir. Baghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces. Hoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front. Advent of Isis Baghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. But Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad. In the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed \"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant\" (Isis/Isil). When al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda. Isis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws. Its stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq. The caliph In June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis \"Islamic State\". Days later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph. The media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times. But if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.

    "text": "The Sewol sank off the south-western island of Jindo on 16 April 2014 killing 304 people, almost all school children on a trip. It has been winched to the surface so a platform can be inserted under it for it to be towed ashore. It is expected to arrive at port in less than two weeks, where it will be met by the families of victims. The bodies of nine victims are believed to still be trapped inside the sunken ship, and raising it was one of the central demands of their families. The government bowed to pressure to raise the 6,825 tonne vessel, one of the most complex operations ever attempted, said the the BBC's Stephen Evans on Jindo Island. The 16-year-old daughter of Huh Hong-Hwan was one victim whose remains were never found. \"To see the Sewol again, I can't describe how I'm feeling right now,\" Mr Huh told the AFP news agency as he watched the raising of the ship from a boat nearby. The sinking was blamed on a combination of illegal redesigns, cargo overloading, the inexperience of the crew member steering the vessel, and lax government regulations. The ship's captain was later convicted of murder. Anger over the response of the authorities after the disaster contributed to the unpopularity of former President Park Geun-hye, who was recently ousted.",

The group had travelled to the area, in the state of Guerrero, to take part in a protest over teachers' rights. Police opened fire on their buses, killing six people. Twenty-two police officers are being held in connection with the shooting. Witnesses said that most of the survivors - all trainee teachers - were bundled into police vans before disappearing. Some had gone into hiding and contacted their relatives after several days, still fearing for their lives. 'Anonymous tip' It was thought initially that 44 students, not 43, had gone missing. They had been taking part in a protest over job discrimination against rural teachers. Iguala lies about 120 miles (200km) south of the capital Mexico City. The grave was discovered on Saturday, following an anonymous tip, local media reported. It is not known exactly how many bodies it contains. Guerrero state prosecutor Inaky Blanco said forensic scientists were trying to identify the victims. \"We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site,\" Mr Blanco said at a media conference in the state capital, Chilpancingo. At least 15 bodies have already been retrieved from the pit. Some of the relatives of the missing students had joined the search, knocking on doors and handing out pictures of their loved ones. State prosecutors said local officials and police officers could have links with criminal gangs operating in Guerrero state. Arrest warrants have been issued for the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Albarca, and his security chief who are both considered fugitives from justice and may be involved in the violence. Mexico correspondent Will Grant says the incident has highlighted the extent of the collusion between criminal groups and officials in much of the country.",

    "text": "The FBI believe Samuel Little, who is 78, may be among the most prolific serial killers in US criminal history. State and federal agencies are now working to match his confessions with the deaths of dozens of women across the country from 1970 to 2005. Investigators say they have already linked him to 34 murders and are working to corroborate many others. Little is currently serving life in prison after being sentenced in 2014 for the murders of three women. He has been in custody since September 2012 when he was arrested at a Kentucky homeless shelter and transferred to California where he was wanted on a drugs charge. DNA samples taken from Little were then linked to the unsolved deaths of three women in Los Angeles county in 1987 and 1989. All three of those victims had been beaten and strangled before their bodies were dumped separately. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually sentenced to three consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole. Before that he already had an extensive criminal record, with offences including rape and armed robbery. The murder convictions led to Little being referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) - a scheme that works to analyse serial offenders of violent and sexual crimes, and share information with local law enforcement agencies to cross-reference unsolved crimes. Officials from the programme say they then uncovered an \"alarming pattern\" and \"compelling links\" to many more murders across the US. One unsolved cold-case murder in Odessa, Texas of a woman named Denise Christie Brothers was then pursued by local authorities. A local ranger, James Holland, then travelled to California with ViCAP team members earlier this year to interview Little. They say Little agreed to talk to them because he was hoping to move prisons. The FBI say that Little has confessed to 90 killings in total - stretching states across the breadth of the US, from California to Maryland. The ViCap team said in a news release earlier this week they had so far established his ties to 34 deaths, with many others apparently pending confirmation. \"Over the course of that interview in May, he went through city and state and gave Ranger Holland the number of people he killed in each place. Jackson, Mississippi - one; Cincinnati, Ohio - one; Phoenix, Arizona - three; Las Vegas, Nevada - one,\" ViCAP Crime Analyst Christina Palazzolo said in the report. They believe Little particularly targeted marginalised and vulnerable women who were involved in prostitution or addicted to drugs. Investigators say their bodies were often left unidentified and their deaths un-investigated by authorities. \"Little's method of killing also didn't always leave obvious signs that the death was a homicide. The one-time competitive boxer usually stunned or knocked out his victims with powerful punches and then strangled them,\" the FBI report said. \"With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,\" it continued. A large number are believed to have taken place in the 1970s and early 1980s before DNA technology was available to police. Beth Silverman, the Los Angeles County prosecutor who helped convict Little in 2014, told the New York Times that \"a lot of agencies around the country...dropped the ball on this case\". \"He got off over and over and over again,\" she told the newspaper. The FBI says the 78-year-old is \"in poor health\" and is likely to now remain in prison in Texas until his death, where he was transferred from California after admitting the Odessa killing. The bureau says it is continuing to work alongside Ranger Holland, who is said to be interviewing Little \"nearly daily\", to help build an accurate and full picture of his crimes. \"The biggest lesson in this case is the power of information sharing,\" Kevin Fitzsimmons, ViCAP's supervisory crime analyst said in the FBI report. \"A Jane Doe [unidentified victim] who turned up dead in an alley in New Orleans may look like an isolated event but when entered into the ViCAP database and examined with other mysterious deaths or missing persons, patterns emerge. That is the value of ViCAP.\"",

Frontex said it was picking up all the migrants it encountered at sea because bad weather made the crossing more dangerous during the winter. More than 1m people arrived in the EU in 2015, making it Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War Two. New reception centres Frontex announced Thursday's rescue in a tweet, posting a photo of some of the migrants who later disembarked from the Bulgarian ship at Mytilene. The migrants' nationalities were not immediately known. Earlier this week, Greek started to register asylum seekers at four new reception centres on islands near Turkey, including Lesbos. This is being done in line with a demand from the EU. Converted shipping containers and prefab shelters are being used to house thousands of people. The EU says they must all be registered there and fingerprinted before going anywhere else. Last year more than 850,000 migrants - mostly refugees fleeing war and abuses in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - entered Greece as a gateway to the EU. During the summer months, some 7,000 migrants were arriving in Greece every day after crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey. More than 700 died during their perilous journeys last year, and at least another 100 this year. The EU has pledged €3bn (£2.3bn; $3.3bn) to Turkey in return for housing refugees and strengthening the country's borders. Turkey is home to nearly three million refugees, most of them from Syria. Many of them pay smugglers thousands of dollars to make the crossing to Greece. They then head north, trying to reach Germany and Scandinavia.

    "text": "China has criticised the BBC for its reporting on coronavirus and the persecution of ethnic minority Uighurs. The BBC said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision. It follows British media regulator Ofcom revoking state broadcaster China Global Television Network's (CGTN) licence to broadcast in the UK. Separately, the broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) said it would stop relaying BBC World Service programming in the region, prompting condemnation from the BBC. 'Curtailing freedom' China's National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) said that BBC World News reports about China were found to \"seriously violate\" broadcast guidelines, including \"the requirement that news should be truthful and fair\" and not \"harm China's national interests\". It said that the BBC's application to air for another year would not be accepted. The BBC said in a statement: \"We are disappointed that the Chinese authorities have decided to take this course of action. The BBC is the world's most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories from around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\" The commercially funded BBC World News TV channel broadcasts globally in English. In China it is largely restricted and appears only in international hotels and some diplomatic compounds, meaning most Chinese people cannot view it. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the move an \"unacceptable curtailing of media freedom\". The US State Department condemned the decision, calling it part of a wider campaign to suppress free media in China. In Hong Kong, the publicly-funded broadcaster RTHK said it was suspending the relaying of BBC World Service radio. It had previously aired it daily from 23:00 to 07:00. It also removed a weekly Cantonese programme from the BBC's Chinese Service from its schedule. BBC World News TV channel broadcasts, however, are still available in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, a former British colony, is expected to retain certain rights and freedoms, including freedom of press, until 2047, as part of a handover agreement between China and Britain. Hong Kong Journalists Association chairman Chris Yeung Kin-hing told the South China Morning Post that RTHK's decision was \"disturbing and worrying\", amid questions about whether RTHK was instructed to act by the authorities. The RTHK union also called the decision \"extremely regrettable\", adding: \"Under the policy of One Country Two Systems, we've never seen Hong Kong being required to follow decisions of China's State Film, TV and Radio Administration before\". Hong Kong's Office of the Communications Authority said it \"did not set boundaries\" and that decisions were up to individual operators. A BBC spokeswoman said: \"We condemn this decision by the Chinese authorities. Access to accurate and impartial news is a fundamental human right and should not be denied to the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week.\" The corporation rejected accusations of bias and said it would make every effort to bring the news to its audiences, who would \"still find ways to access the BBC\". The actions in China and Hong Kong follow Ofcom's revoking of the CGTN licence after it found it was wrongfully held by Star China Media Ltd. CGTN was also found in breach of British broadcasting regulations last year, for airing the allegedly forced confession of UK citizen Peter Humphrey. CGTN can now also no longer be broadcast in Germany following Ofcom's decision, Deutsche Welle reports, as the licence in Germany had been approved by Ofcom as part of a sharing initiative. Worsening relations Relations between China and the UK have seen a serious deterioration in recent months over Hong Kong, where Beijing introduced a controversial new security law after a large pro-democracy movement swept the ex-colony. In January the UK introduced a new visa that gives 5.4 million Hong Kong residents the right to live in the UK and eventually become citizens because it believes China is undermining the territory's rights and freedoms. And in the past two years China has been systematically blocking or banning foreign media, including in effect expelling journalists from three US newspapers in 2020. The BBC website and its app are already banned in mainland China. In February the BBC published a report featuring interviews with Uighur women who said they had been systematically raped, sexually abused and tortured in China's \"re-education\" camps in Xinjiang. China's foreign ministry accused the BBC of making a \"false report\". Last month the US said China had committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim groups. According to estimates, more than a million Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in camps in China. China denies that Uighurs are persecuted. Last year China's UK ambassador Liu Xiaoming told the BBC's Andrew Marr that reports of concentration camps were \"fake\" and the Uighurs received the same treatment under the law as other ethnic groups in his country.",

The statements come amid concern among world powers over a series of ballistic missile tests by Iran. Iran denies the tests breach a UN resolution on its missile programme. The resolution, passed last year, calls on Iran not to develop or test ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Iran test-fired a nuclear weapon-capable ballistic missile in October 2015 and carried out more ballistic missile tests earlier this month. Iran's missile programme was not banned under a deal last year with world powers which curbed its nuclear activity, but the call to desist forms part of a resolution endorsing the agreement. 'Defence power' On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the recent missile test had caused \"alarm and concern\" but that it would be up to the United Nations Security Council to decide what to do, Reuters news agency reported. In comments carried on his website, Ayatollah Khamenei said any negotiations should be backed by military strength. \"If the Islamic system pursues technology and negotiations without defence power, then this will be a retreat in the face of threats from other insignificant countries,\" the website quoted him as saying. \"People say that tomorrow's world is a world of negotiations and not a world of missiles. If they say this thoughtlessly, it shows that they are thoughtless. However, if this is intentional, then this is treachery.\" The statement comes days after former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani tweeted \"the future is in dialogue, not missiles\".

    "text": "By Mir SabbirBBC Bengali, Dhaka Her courage in speaking out against sexual assault, her death five days after being set alight and everything that happened in-between has gripped Bangladesh and brought attention to the vulnerability of sexual harassment victims in this conservative South Asian country. Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out. Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened. At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal. In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint \"no big deal\" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media. 'I tried to take her to school' Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these. On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety. Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams. \"I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter,\" said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman. \"If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister,\" he said. According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire. Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted \"to make it look like a suicide\". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died. \"One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned,\" Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali. But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone. \"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" you can hear her say. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa. News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni. Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. \"None of the culprits will be spared from legal action,\" she said. Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh. \"Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists,\" said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page. \"I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry,\" wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post. According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher. \"When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations,\" said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association. \"It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples.\" Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh? In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students. \"This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done,\" said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka. \"Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools,\" she said. \"They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment.\"",

    "text": "The 16-year-old is the youngest person to be chosen by the magazine in a tradition that started in 1927. Speaking at a UN climate change summit in Madrid before the announcement, she urged world leaders to stop using \"creative PR\" to avoid real action. The next decade would define the planet's future, she said. Last year, the teenager started an environmental strike by missing lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. It sparked a worldwide movement that became popular with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. Since then, she has become a strong voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. Earlier this year, she was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. At the UN Climate Conference in New York in September, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. In a now-famous speech, she said: \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We'll be watching you.\" Reacting to the nomination on Twitter, the activist said: \"Wow, this is unbelievable! I share this great honour with everyone in the #FridaysForFuture movement and climate activists everywhere.\" The teenager's message, however, has not been well received by everyone, most notably prominent conservative voices. Before her appearance in Madrid, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro called her a \"brat\" after she expressed concern about the killing of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. \"Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,\" Mr Bolsonaro told reporters. \"It's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,\" he said, using the Portuguese word for brat, \"pirralha\". The activist responded by briefly changing her Twitter bio to \"Pirralha\". She has previously been at odds with US President Donald Trump, who has questioned climate science and rolled back many US climate laws, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who once called her a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\". Announcing Time's decision on NBC, editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said: \"She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.\" The magazine's tradition, which started as Man of the Year, recognises the person who \"for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year\". Last year, it named murdered and imprisoned journalists, calling them \"The Guardians\". What happened in Madrid? At the COP25 Climate Conference in Madrid, Greta Thunberg accused world powers of making constant attempts \"to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition\". \"The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when, in fact, almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,\" she said, drawing applause. \"In just three weeks we'll enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future,\" she added. \"Right now, we're desperate for any sign of hope.\" A speech grounded in research This was meant to be a big moment in the talks, the elixir of the \"Greta effect\" bringing new energy to a flagging process. The teenager is almost certainly the most famous person here, attracting far more attention than other celebrities like Al Gore, and the UN badly needs a boost. Her talk came over as measured, grounded in the latest research, and avoided the flash of hurt and anger she displayed in New York in September. Looking around the hall, it was striking how many of the national delegations had not turned up for this morning session at the conference. A snub by the big fossil fuel economies? Or maybe they were too busy in the negotiations themselves? In any event, the passion among the millions of young people who have taken to the streets to demand action on climate change feels very remote from the diplomatic struggles in these halls. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission - the EU executive - announced ambitious environmental proposals to cut the bloc's dependency on fossil fuels, hoping to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on 1 December, called the European Green Deal Europe's \"man on the Moon moment\". It includes proposals that affect everything from transport and buildings to food production, and air and water pollution. The package will be debated by EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and includes: Reacting to the proposals, Jagoda Munic, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe, said they were \"too small, too few and too far off\", adding: \"We're on a runaway train to ecological and climate collapse and the EU Commission is gently switching gears instead of slamming on the brakes.\"",

    "text": "The operating system, which runs on its iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices, will no longer include Google Maps software. Apple will instead run its own mapping app, which has a high-quality 3D mode, on the platform. Google announced its own 3D mapping software last week on its competing mobile platform, Android. Both companies have used fleets of planes to capture the imagery, drawing concerns from some privacy campaigners. Apple's updated iOS software is being released in beta on Tuesday, and will be available for general consumers by the autumn, chief executive Tim Cook said. It will be a free update for owners of either an iPhone 4S, iPhone 4 or iPhone 3GS - as well as users of the latest iPad, the iPad 2 and fourth generation iPod touch. 'Biggest cheer' Additional features include \"eyes free\", a feature on which Apple said it had worked with car manufacturers to integrate a \"Siri button\" to activate the iPhone's voice-operated assistant. For the first time on Apple's devices, video calls will be able to be made over a cellular connection, rather than relying on wi-fi. The switch to its own mapping platform will provide Apple with even more opportunities to monetise its users, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Gartner, who attended the event in San Francisco. \"Maps got the biggest cheer [from the audience],\" she said. \"The opportunity that controlling maps gives to Apple for learning more about what their users are doing, keeping that information, and then being able to leverage that for advertising purposes is huge.\" Ms Milanesi said the announcements appeared to be warmly received by the developers in attendance. \"iOS6 is a continued evolution,\" she told the BBC. \"I think the whole operating system is getting more clever. It's learning from what consumers are doing and improving the experience.\" Macbook revamp The company also announced revamped models in its Macbook Pro and Macbook Air ranges. Its new Macbook Pro is 0.71 inches thick, with a high-resolution Retina display. It utilises Intel's Ivy Bridge processor. Its slimline Macbook Air range has also been upgraded with enhanced graphics and processing capabilities. Both will offer a free upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion, the latest version of the Mac operating system which is set for release in July. Among its features is enhanced synchronisation between desktop, laptop and mobile, thanks to iCloud, the company's cloud-based storage service.

    "text": "Syria's head of antiquities was quoted as saying the temple was blown up on Sunday. The UK -based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that it happened a month ago. IS took control of Palmyra in May, sparking fears for the site. It is considered one of the ancient world's most important cultural centres. The ancient city, which is a Unesco World Heritage site, is famed for its well-preserved Graeco-Roman ruins, and the Baalshamin temple, built nearly 2,000 years ago, is one of the city's best-known buildings. The Islamic State group has destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq. The militants believe any shrines or statues implying the existence of another deity are sacrilege and idolatry, and should be destroyed. IS \"placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baalshamin today [Sunday] and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple,\" Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdul Karim told AFP news agency. \"The cella (inner area of the temple) was destroyed and the columns around collapsed,\" he said. Emma Loosley, a professor at Exeter University who lived near the ancient city for three years, said the temple's cella was \"pretty much perfect\". \"I can't think of another temple as beautifully preserved as the temple of Baalshamin, and what was special about Palmyra was that it was a unique culture,\" she told the BBC. \"It had its own gods, its own form of art and architecture that you don't get anywhere else.\" Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra The Baalshamin temple is dedicated to the Phoenician god of storms and fertilising rains, and was almost completely intact. The oldest parts of the temple are thought to have dated from the year 17AD. Residents who had fled from Palmyra also said IS had planted explosives at the temple, although they had done it about one month ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last month, IS published photos of militants destroying what it said were artefacts looted at Palmyra. A week ago, it emerged that the archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades, Khaled al-Asaad, had been beheaded by the militant group. Mr Abdul Karim said the 81-year-old had refused to tell IS where some treasures had been hidden, in an effort to save them. The group has also published photos of what they said was the destruction of two Islamic shrines near Palmyra, which they described as \"manifestations of polytheism\". The modern city of Palmyra - known locally as Tadmur - is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the eastern city of Deir al-Zour. IS attacks on historical sites and artefacts January: IS ransacks the central library in the Iraqi city of Mosul, burning thousands of books. February: A video emerges showing the destruction of ancient artefacts at the central museum in Mosul. March: IS uses explosives and bulldozers on Nimrud, one of Iraq's greatest archaeological treasures. Shortly after, IS militants destroy ruins at Hatra.

    "text": "The constitutional changes were passed by the annual sitting of parliament, the National People's Congress. The vote was widely regarded as a rubber-stamping exercise. Two delegates voted against the change and three abstained, out of 2,964 votes. China had imposed a two-term limit on its president since the 1990s. But Mr Xi, who would have been due to step down in 2023, defied the tradition of presenting a potential successor during October's Communist Party Congress. Instead, he consolidated his political power as the party voted to enshrine his name and political ideology in the party's constitution - elevating his status to the level of its founder, Chairman Mao. On paper, the congress is the most powerful legislative body in China - similar to the parliament in other nations. But it was widely believed that it would approve what it was told to. Xi forever? Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing It is now hard to see Xi Jinping being challenged in any way whatsoever. He has amassed power the likes of which has not been seen since Chairman Mao Zedong. Only five years ago Beijing was being ruled by a collective leadership. Under ex-President Hu Jintao you could imagine differing views being expressed in the then nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. There was a feeling that Mr Hu needed to please various factions within the Communist Party and it seemed that every 10 years a new leader would come along with their own people in a process of smooth transition. From today all this has gone. The constitution has been altered to allow Xi Jinping to remain as president beyond two terms and they would not have gone to this much trouble if that was not exactly what he intended to do. There has been no national debate as to whether a leader should be allowed to stay on for as long as they choose. Quietly but surely Xi Jinping has changed the way his country is governed, with himself well and truly at the core. Rare dissent The issue is not, however, without controversy. Online censors in China have been blocking discussion around the topic, including images of Winnie the Pooh. Social media users have taken to using the cartoon character to represent Mr Xi. One government critic described the proposal in an open letter last month as a \"farce\", in a rare show of public dissent. Former state newspaper editor Li Datong wrote that scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos - in a message sent to some members of the national congress. \"I couldn't bear it any more. I was discussing with my friends and we were enraged. We have to voice our opposition,\" he told BBC Chinese. State media, however, have portrayed the changes as much-needed reform. US President Donald Trump was criticised by some commentators for seeming to approve of Mr Xi's unlimited rule, saying on Monday: \"President for life... I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day.\" At a political rally on Saturday, Mr Trump insisted he had merely been joking during a fundraiser, and that his comments were represented unfairly by some media. Xi Jinping thought Mr Xi's possible third term is not the only item the National People's Congress is likely to approve. It was also expected to: Xi Jinping thought is the ideology approved by the Communist Party last October. Officially, it is \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era\". Schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will have to study the political ideology, which the Communist Party is trying to portray as a new chapter for modern China. More on China under Xi Mr Xi became president in 2013, and quickly consolidated personal power while cementing China as the regional superpower. He also fought corruption, punishing more than a million party members - which has helped his popularity among some. At the same time, however, China has clamped down on many emerging freedoms, increasing its state surveillance and censorship programs. Critics also say Mr Xi has used the anti-corruption purge to sideline political rivals.",

    "text": "Two of the men were among the kingdom's most influential figures. The detentions are seen as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightening his grip on power. In 2017 dozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen were confined to Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel after the crown prince ordered their arrests. Mohammed bin Salman, a controversial figure, has been considered the de facto ruler of the kingdom after he was named crown prince by his father in 2016. The detentions were first revealed by the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which said they took place early on Friday. The three men arrested are the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and a royal cousin, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef. Mohammed bin Nayef was interior minister until he was removed from his role and placed under house arrest by Mohammed Bin Salman in 2017. In his previous role, he was seen as a close and trusted partner by US intelligence officials. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 78, is the king's only surviving full brother. In 2018 he made comments seen as critical of the crown prince to protesters in London but later said he had been misinterpreted. Both men were seen as potential rivals to the 34-year-old crown prince, who is first in line for the throne. Guards arrived at the homes of the royals wearing masks and dressed in black, and searched the properties, the Wall Street Journal says. This is a significant move by Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate his position. Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz is one of the last surviving sons of the country's founder, King Abdelaziz, and widely respected amongst older members of the ruling family. The other senior prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was next in line to the throne before he was suddenly replaced three years ago. Before that, as interior minister, he was credited with defeating the al-Qaeda insurgency that gripped Saudi Arabia in the 2000s. There has been no immediate official confirmation or denial of the story published in the US media but palace affairs in Saudi Arabia are often shrouded in secrecy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman won international praise in 2016 when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018. He has also been criticised over the continuing conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia backs pro-government forces, and the harsh treatment of women's rights activists. despite the lifting of some restrictions including the right to drive. In recent days Saudi Arabia has been taking measures to contain the spread of the deadly new coronavirus. Foreign pilgrims have been prevented from entering the country to perform Umrah, or pilgrimage, and there are questions over whether the hugely important annual Hajj will go ahead this year, On Thursday Islam's holiest city Mecca was emptied to allow a deep clean.

It examined data from 1969-2004 on children under five living near 13 nuclear power plants in Britain. About 500 children develop leukaemia each year - the majority are cured. COMARE was set up in 1985 to advise government on the health effects of radiation. The committee examined 430 cases of leukaemia occurring within 25 kilometres of nuclear power plants over the 35-year period. COMARE has recommended that the government looks at other possible factors involved in childhood leukaemia. Infection link In an earlier report it found that cases of leukaemia were more likely among wealthier families in the least overcrowded conditions. Other studies have suggested that babies who have regular contact with other children are less likely to develop leukaemia, perhaps because their immune system is primed by early contact with infections. Professor Alex Elliott from the University of Glasgow, who chaired the committee, said \"We should not be complacent about this issue, but we think the government should be looking for other causes beyond radiation for childhood leukaemia cases.\" The committee will now examine clusters of leukaemia cases previously identified around the Sellafield reprocessing plant and Dounreay research facility - these were not included in the current report which focussed only on power plants.",

    "text": "By Liza TambunanBBC News Indonesian Citra* thought it was just a work meeting. Two men, claiming to be local officials, said they wanted to go over budgets for a project she was running at a local aid agency. The then 28-year-old was slightly nervous about going alone but keen to distinguish herself at work, so she pushed such concerns aside. An hour in, the men suggested the meeting continue at a different location and invited her to ride in their car. Insisting on taking her own motorbike she went to slide her key into the ignition, when suddenly another group of men grabbed her. \"I was kicking and screaming, as they pushed me into the car. I was helpless. Inside two people held me down,\" she says. \"I knew what was happening.\" She was being captured in order to be wed. Bride kidnapping, or kawin tangkap, is a controversial practice in Sumba with disputed origins which sees women taken by force by family members or friends of men who want to marry them. Despite long-standing calls for it to be banned by women's rights groups, it continues to be carried out in certain parts of Sumba, a remote Indonesian island east of Bali. But after two bride kidnappings were captured on video and widely shared on social media, the central government is now calling for it to end. 'It felt like I was dying' Inside the car, Citra managed to message her boyfriend and parents before arriving at a traditional house, with its high peaked roof and solid wooden pillars. The family who kidnapped her, she then realised, were distant relatives from her father's side. \"There were lots of people waiting there. They sounded a gong as I arrived and started doing rituals.\" An ancient animist religion, known as Marapu, is widely practised in Sumba alongside Christianity and Islam. To keep the world in balance, spirits are appeased by ceremonies and sacrifices. \"In Sumba, people believe that when water touches your forehead you cannot leave the house,\" Citra said. \"I was very aware of what was happening, so when they tried to do that I turned at the last minute so that the water didn't touch my forehead.\" Her captors told her repeatedly that they were acting out of love for her and tried to woo her into accepting the marriage. \"I cried until my throat was dry. I threw myself on the ground. I kept jabbing the motorbike key that I was holding into my stomach until it bruised. I hit my head against the large wooden pillars. I wanted them to understand I didn't want this. I hoped they would feel sorry for me.\" For the next six days she was kept, effectively a prisoner in their house, sleeping in the living room. \"I cried all night, and I didn't sleep. It felt like I was dying.\" Citra refused to eat or drink anything the family offered her believing it would put her under a spell: \"If we take their food, we would say yes to the marriage.\" Her sister smuggled food and water to her while her family, with the support of women's rights groups, negotiated her release with village elders and the family of the potential groom. No position to negotiate Women's rights group Peruati has documented seven such bride kidnappings in the last four years, and believe many more have taken place in remote areas of the island. Just three women, including Citra, ended up being freed. In the two most recent cases that were captured on video in June, one woman stayed in the marriage. \"They stayed because they didn't have a choice,\" says activist Aprissa Taranau, the local head of Peruati. \"Kawin tangkap can sometimes be a form of arranged marriage and women are not in a position to negotiate.\" She says those that do manage to leave are often stigmatised by their community. \"They're labelled as a disgrace and people say they will not be able to get married now or have children. So women stay because of a fear of that,\" she says. That is what Citra was told. \"Thank God I am now married to my boyfriend and we have a one-year old child,\" she says with a smile, three years on from her ordeal. Promises to outlaw the practice Local historian and elder Frans Wora Hebi argues the practice is not part of Sumba's rich cultural traditions and says it is used by people wanting to force women to marry them without consequences. A lack of firm action by custodial leaders and the authorities means the practice continues, he says. \"There are no laws against it, only sometimes there is social reprimand against those who practice it but there is no legal or cultural deterrent.\" Following a national outcry, regional leaders in Sumba signed a joint declaration rejecting the practice early this month. Women's Empowerment Minister Bintang Puspayoga flew to the island from the capital, Jakarta, to attend. Speaking to the media after the event she said: \"We have heard from custodial leaders and religious leaders, that the practice of capture and wed that went viral is not truly part of Sumba's traditions.\" She promised that the declaration was the beginning of a wider government effort to end the practice that she described as violence against women. Rights groups have welcomed the move but described it as \"a first step in a long journey\". Citra says she is grateful that the government is now paying attention to the practice and hopes, as a result, no one will have to go through what she did. \"For some this may be a tradition from our ancestors. But it's an out of date custom that must stop because it's very damaging to women.\" *Citra's name has been changed to protect her identity. You may also be interested in:",

    "text": "Aid agency Care said camps had turned into \"lakes\" at 87 sites in northern Idlib and western Aleppo provinces, which are held by opposition forces. Some people were having to shelter in public buildings or out in the open as temperatures fell below zero, it said. One child has reportedly died as a result of the harsh weather conditions. Children and women make up 80% of the region's 1.5 million camp residents. More than 12 million Syrians have fled their homes since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad almost 10 years ago. Some 6.6 million are internally displaced, while 5.6 million have sought refuge abroad. Care's country director in Turkey, Sherine Ibrahim, said humanitarian organisations were rushing to provide emergency relief to the thousands who had lost their homes in Aleppo and Idlib, but that reaching them had been made difficult by the flooding of access roads. They are also concerned that the situation might contribute to the rise in Covid-19 infections, she added. As of last Wednesday, health authorities in north-western Syria had recorded 20,000 confirmed cases and 379 deaths. \"With inadequate shelter and increasing hunger for displaced Syrians in the north-west of the country, they are running out of coping strategies to keep themselves and their loved ones safe,\" Ms Ibrahim warned. \"Zainab\", a woman living at a camp in Idlib told Care: \"The water came into the tent where I live with my grandchildren, covering the ground. We cannot live in it now. Look at how our situation has become. We do not have blankets, food, or any other supplies. \"The water has destroyed everything; there is nothing left. These are difficult times,\" she added. \"Abu Ali\", who was displaced last year, said his family had not had any clean drinking water for more than a week because there was no way for aid agencies to deliver it to their camp. The Syria Civil Defence, whose first responders are known as the White Helmets, said on Sunday that it was continuing emergency operations despite the rainstorm ending. It was also providing services and assistance to more than 3,200 affected families in more than 225 camps. Last week, the Syria Civil Defence reported that a six-year-old boy was killed in Idlib after a brick wall built around his tent collapsed on top of him.",

    "text": "Abdul Momen told the BBC that Ms Begum has \"nothing to do\" with his country. The 19-year-old, who left east London to join the Islamic State group in 2015, was stripped of her British citizenship in February. Her claim to Bangladeshi nationality through her mother is believed to have informed the Home Office's decision. Under international law, it is illegal to deprive nationals of citizenship if to do so would leave them stateless. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Begum's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, told the BBC \"in no way is she Bangladesh's problem\". Ms Begum is appealing against the Home Office's decision. Mr Momen said there was \"no question\" of giving Ms Begum Bangladeshi citizenship or allowing her into the country, piling pressure on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to settle her status. \"She has never sought Bangladeshi citizenship and her parents are also British citizens,\" he told the BBC. \"The British government is responsible for her. They'll have to deal with her.\" He added that, if she did end up coming to Bangladesh, she would fall foul of the country's \"zero tolerance policy\" towards terrorism. \"Bangladeshi law is very clear. Terrorists will have to face the death penalty,\" he said. Although Ms Begum travelled to Syria to join the IS group, she has not admitted any terror offences. The Home Office could reverse its decision \"at any time\" and doing so would \"save British taxpayers a lot of money\" in court costs and legal aid, Mr Akunjee said. \"What Sajid Javid did in stripping Shamima of her citizenship is human fly tipping - taking our problems and dumping them on other countries,\" he said. The Home Office told the BBC it would not respond to Mr Momen's comments and had nothing further to add to its previous statement. Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends at the age of 15 before being found by a journalist from the Times in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February this year. Heavily pregnant with her third child, she pleaded to return to the UK, claiming she had been \"brainwashed\" by Islamic State and now \"regrets everything\". She said she did not regret travelling to Syria but did not agree with everything the IS group had done. Mr Javid did not acquiesce to her pleas, telling MPs he \"won't hesitate\" to revoke her citizenship in the interests of national security. \"If you back terror, there must be consequences,\" he said. Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Mr Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. Under the 1981 British Nationality Act, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be \"conducive to the public good\" and they would not become stateless as a result.",

    "text": "Images from a joint Homeland Security and FBI bulletin show the remains of a dark backpack, a detonation device and mangled pieces of metal. Three people were killed and more than 170 injured when two devices exploded near the finish line of Monday's race. Those who died were an eight-year-old boy, a woman aged 29 and a postgraduate student from China. The BBC's Paul Adams, in Boston, says vigils for the victims were held across the city on Tuesday night as Bostonians still wrestled with why anyone would want to attack their much-loved marathon. President Barack Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for a memorial. 'Someone knows' FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers told a news conference that pieces of nylon had been recovered from the scene, along with fragments of ball bearings and nails that were \"possibly contained in a pressure-cooker device\". He said they were being sent to the agency's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where experts would reconstruct the devices to determine their make-up and components. \"The investigation is in its infancy,\" he added. \"There are no claims of responsibility and the range of suspects and motives remains wide open.\" Mr DesLauriers urged people to report anyone they had seen acting suspiciously. \"Someone knows who did this,\" he said. The Associated Press quoted a source close to the investigation as saying that the bombs consisted of explosives placed in 1.6-gallon (6-litre) pressure cookers, one with shards of metal and ball bearings, the other with nails. The bombs were put into black bags and left on the ground, the source said. It has been reported that a circuit board and battery pack - parts of a triggering mechanism - were recovered. And the lid of a pressure cooker, apparently blown off during the explosion, was found on the roof of a nearby building, an official said on Wednesday. Doctors treating the wounded say their injuries indicate that the bombs contained metal shards and other shrapnel. A number of victims have had limbs amputated. Boston Medical Center trauma surgery chief Peter Burke said hospitals were saving \"large quantities\" of fragments extracted from victims for the police. They include metal, plastic, wood and concrete. At least 58 of the injured have been released from various hospitals around the city, according to AP. Of those that remain, 17 patients are listed as in a critical condition. President Obama will address an interfaith service in Boston for the victims on Thursday morning. The White House said Mr Obama had cancelled a planned trip to Kansas to speak. President Obama has condemned the bombings as a terrorist act. He said the attack was \"heinous and cowardly\" but stressed it was not yet known whether an organisation - either domestic or foreign - or a \"malevolent individual\" was responsible, nor what the motive might have been. \"Everything else at this point is speculation,\" he said. \"It will take time... but we will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice.\" One of those who died has been named as eight-year-old Martin Richard, from the Dorchester area of Boston. He was at the finishing line with his mother and sister, who were both seriously injured. \"They were looking in the crowd as the runners were coming to see if they could identify some of their friends when the bomb hit,\" Congressman Stephen Lynch, a friend of the Richard family, told Associated Press. Flowers and tributes were being placed outside the family's home on Tuesday. A second victim was named as Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Her mother, Patty, shaking with emotion, told reporters that \"you couldn't ask for a better daughter\". \"Everybody who knew her loved her... she had a heart of gold. This doesn't make any sense.\" Boston University said the third person who died was a graduate student. The Chinese consulate in New York confirmed that she was a Chinese national. \"At the request of her family, the victim's personal information will not be disclosed,\" said a statement from the consulate. She has been identified, however, by a Hong Kong TV channel which said she was from Shenyang in north-eastern China. The university said she was with two friends watching the race near the finish line. One of the friends, named as Zhou Danling by Chinese TV, was said to be in a stable condition in hospital. The consulate said it was providing \"all necessary assistance\" to the two families. The first explosion went off close to the finish line at about 14:50 local time (18:50 GMT) on Monday. Seconds later, as rescuers were rushing to help the injured, another explosion went off nearby. Police have asked the public to send in any videos or photographs they may have from the day. The London Marathon - the next major international marathon - is to go ahead on Sunday, with police saying they have well-rehearsed security plans. Organisers have said they will hold a 30-second silence at the start as a mark of respect.",

It came after the racy video for her song, I Have Issues, sparked outrage in the socially conservative country. She has apologised to people who took the video \"in an inappropriate way\". \"I didn't imagine all this would happen and that I would be subjected to such a strong attack from everyone,\" she wrote on her now-deleted Facebook page. In the video, the singer appears in a classroom with several young men. Standing in front of a blackboard bearing the phrase \"Class #69\", she proceeds to eat an apple, banana and some crisps in a sexually suggestive manner. The scene is interspersed with pictures of her wearing lingerie. \"Shyma presents a lesson in depravity to youths,\" wrote the Youm al-Sabaa newspaper after the video was released. On Monday, two days after her arrest, the public prosecutor's office ordered that Shyma's detention be extended for a week, Youm al-Sabaa reported. Arrest warrants were also issued for the directors of the video, it said. Last year, Egyptian courts sentenced three female dancers to six months each in prison after convicting them of inciting debauchery in music videos. Another singer is meanwhile facing trial for \"spreading provocative publicity\" because she suggested that drinking from the River Nile could make someone ill. A lawsuit was filed after video emerged showing Sherine Abdel Wahab being asked at a concert last year to sing Mashrebtesh Men Nilha (Have You Drunk From The Nile?).

    "text": "Here is a round-up of reaction to the BBC's decision, along with a statement from director general Tony Hall. Tony Hall, BBC director general \"This has been a difficult time for the team and also obviously for the individuals concerned. \"What we know is that the producer Oisin Tymon was indeed attacked by Jeremy Clarkson and he was then subjected to sustained to verbal abuse of the sort that no one should have to endure. \"We all know that Jeremy is a huge talent and has made an extraordinary contribution to the BBC. I've always been a great fan of his work on Top Gear. I also believe that his voice and voices like his have a really important place in the BBC. But not at any price. \"Physical violence accompanied by prolonged verbal abuse has, in my view, crossed a line and that's why with regret I have decided we will not be renewing Jeremy's contract. \"People love Top Gear, I love Top Gear. Our priority now is to look to the future and how we can bring it back in great shape in 2016 and yes, of course, it will be different. \"I also want to make sure that Oisin is properly looked after. \"But I just want to end by saying to Jeremy a very big thank you for nearly 25 years of remarkable programming on Top Gear and to wish him the very, very best for the future.\" \"I don't really have anything to say about it. It's a tragedy. I'm sorry that what ought to have been a small incident sorted out easily has turned into something big. \"I'm sure Top Gear will continue in some way - it existed before us, it's been reformatted several times. \"I don't want to talk about [who will replace Clarkson] too much, but I think of the three of us as a package. It works for very complicated reasons that a lot of people don't fully understand. So that will require a lot of careful thought \"As much as I think he's a knob, I quite like working with Jeremy.\" \"Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together.\" \"Tony Hall was backed into a corner and was unable to make any other decision. \"If this had been kept confidential and investigated there would have been far more options available. At the moment we've lost Top Gear, Jeremy is off the BBC and the corporation probably suffers by about £100m a year. It needed to be investigated, but there was a brighter way to go about it. \"There could have been damages [paid] to the producer, financial penalties to Jeremy, suspension or a cooling down period - all of it could have been decided away from the public spotlight. \"The BBC may continue to try and push the franchise forward, but like him or loathe him, people tune in to Top Gear for Jeremy and the relationship the three boys bring on screen. That chemistry won't exist anymore.\" \"It's hard to fault the inquiry, but some will ask whether the BBC had to deal with it in a formalised way. \"There are three issues at play. One: Talent management - broadcast depends on talent and it would appear there was a long-term failure on talent management in this regard. \"Two: How on Earth do you reinvent Top Gear? It's a special programme because of these three characters. Everyone can see it, but creating it is terribly difficult. \"Three: The BBC really doesn't want to appear anti-Jeremy Clarkson. They want to say it's a broad church. Jeremy Clarkson is a valuable part of the BBC's proposition. They won't be lost without him, but they won't be where they were without him, either.\" \"Tony Hall had no choice. He paid a fulsome and appropriate tribute to Jeremy Clarkson, but verbal abuse on the scale that seems to have taken place is bad enough - if you bash somebody you have no choice. You have to go. \"He's kind of a licensed jester and was able to make inappropriate remarks and get away with it - but this is of a different magnitude. It was a brave but absolutely correct decision. \"It will be very difficult to see him making a comeback to the BBC in any form for at least many years. Maybe he can serve his time, but it's difficult to see that happen. \"The great strength of the BBC is it can reinvent programmes like Top Gear and frequently has done so in the past when stars have moved on. I'm sure they'll do it successfully with Top Gear.\"",

    "text": "The former Mexico City mayor pledged on Saturday to end corruption and impunity to transform the nation on behalf of the poor and marginalised. The 65-year-old, popularly known by his initials Amlo, won a landslide victory in July - his third presidential bid. The political veteran begins his six-year term with approval ratings of 56%. His predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto leaves office with only 24% - his administration was plagued with corruption scandals and murder rates reaching record-high levels. President López Obrador inherits an immediate foreign policy issue - what to do about the thousands of Central American migrants camping on the US-Mexico border. Foreign dignitaries including US Vice-President Mike Pence, first daughter Ivanka Trump and Bolivian President Evo Morales attended the inauguration in the capital. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro did not attend the swearing-in ceremony, at which protesters unfurled a banner reading \"Maduro, you're not welcome\", but did go to a dinner hosted by Amlo. British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who Mr López Obrador considers a close friend, was also present. Mr López Obrador - whose leftist National Regeneration Movement party (Morena) will lead a coalition government - later took part in a traditional indigenous ceremony in Mexico City's Zócalo square. What did Amlo say? \"We will carry out a peaceful and orderly but also deep and radical transformation,\" the silver-haired leader said in his first speech to Congress. \"Because we will put an end to the corruption and impunity that are blocking Mexico's rebirth.\" Mr López Obrador reiterated many of the populist pledges he made during his campaign, tackling crime, poverty and corruption. He intends to rule frugally - selling Mexico's presidential plane, not living in the presidential palace, and by cutting his own salary by 60%. Mexico has privatised almost every part of its economy over the past three decades and Amlo vowed to reverse what he called disastrous neo-liberal economic policies of his predecessors. He promised that he would \"never seek re-election\" and more surprisingly, announced his intention to promote a recall referendum during his administration, allowing voters to remove an elected official through a direct vote. \"I no longer belong to myself, I belong to you, I belong to the people of Mexico,\" the new president said. New hope for Mexico Will Grant, BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent To chants of \"Presidente\" and \"Yes we could!\" inside the chamber, Andres Manuel López Obrador received the presidential sash from the outgoing President Enrique Peña Nieto. There has undoubtedly been a sea change in Mexican politics but whether he will truly be able to effect a change in Mexico remains to be seen. It certainly won't be easy given the extent to which such problems are endemic in the country's politics and society. However, the new presidential approach was clear from the moment Amlo left his home to attend the ceremony. He travelled in the same aging Volkswagen he has driven for years while Mr Peña Nieto was in the usual armoured convoy. Crowds also flocked to watch the ceremony at the official residence of Los Pinos, which President López Obrador has refused to live in and has instead turned into a public museum. His thousands of supporters have gathered in the main square in Mexico City to celebrate a moment many thought would never come: the one-time political outsider now crowned as the new hope for change in Mexico. First act President López Obrador has signed an agreement with three Central American counterparts to create a plan to stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum in the US, the Associated Press reported. Mexico's foreign ministry said the plan included a fund to generate jobs in the region. In the Mexican border city of Tijuana, more than 6,000 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador face months of waiting for their asylum claims to be processed. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries and have travelled more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) for a chance at the American Dream.",

Other companies have designed Braille phones in the past, but OwnFone says its device is the first of its kind to go on sale. For those who can't read Braille, the company can print raised text on the keypad. The phone, currently only available in the UK, retails for £60 and according to its inventor Tom Sunderland, 3D printing the front and back of the device helped to keep the costs down. \"3D printing... provides a fast and cost-effective way to create personalised Braille buttons,\" he says. The device is designed to provide an instant connection between blind users and their friends and family. Haptic touchscreen In 2012, OwnFone launched what was one of the world's first partially 3D printed phones. A year later, the company developed a special child-friendly version called 1stFone, a credit-card sized device with programmable buttons for crucial contacts. OwnFone's new Braille phone is based on these previous two devices, keeping its small form factor and colourful design. \"The phone can be personalised with two or four Braille buttons which are pre-programmed to call friends, family, carers or the emergency services,\" Mr Sunderland told the BBC. \"This is the first phone to have a 3D printed keypad and for people that can't read Braille, we can print texture and raised text on the phone. Our 3D phone printing process is patent pending.\" Those who wish to buy the phone can create a custom design on the company's website. However, at £60 it's the most expensive of the three available options, with their previous models selling for £40 and £50. While this may be the first Braille phone available to consumers, the idea is not an original one. India-based start-up Kriyate built a prototype Braille-enabled smartphone in 2013, featuring a repressible Braille display and feedback controls (known as haptic touch) that beep or vibrate after receiving certain commands. Some visually impaired users of mobile phones may not see the need for this device however, with features such as Apple's VoiceOver becoming more sophisticated. VoiceOver is a \"screenreader\" that allows users to navigate their phone using gesture-based controls. There are also a number of apps on both the Apple Store and Google Play that allow for an easier reading experience for the visually impaired.",

The policy angered France's business community and prompted some wealthy citizens to say they would emigrate. Mr Hollande's government said it would rework the tax, due to take effect in 2013, to meet the council's complaints. In its ruling on Saturday, the Constitutional Council said the new tax rate \"failed to recognise equality before public burdens\" because, unlike other forms of income tax, it was to be applied to individuals rather than households. For example, that meant a household in which one person earned more than 1m euros would pay the tax, but a household in which two people earned 900,000 euros each would not have to pay. The council also rejected new methods for calculating the tax. Pressing ahead But Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the government would press ahead with the new tax rate. \"The government will propose a new system that conforms with the principles laid down by the decision of the Constitutional Council,\" he said. The new rate was seen as largely symbolic since it would have only applied to some 1,500 people for a temporary period of two years. But along with other tax rises, it has still been the subject of fierce debate in France. French actor Gerard Depardieu recently announced he was moving to Belgium to avoid taxes, sparking a furious reaction from some on the left. There was also speculation that people employed in high-income jobs like banking and finance would move elsewhere, including to London. Mr Hollande campaigned against the austerity policies used in many European countries affected by economic crisis, favouring higher taxes rather than spending cuts to bring down the deficit. The 75% rate for high earners was included in the government's 2013 budget, approved by parliament in September.",

Mullah was a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. At his trial earlier this year, he was described by prosecutors as the \"Butcher of Mirpur\", a suburb of Dhaka where he is alleged to have carried out his crimes. These included the massacre of unarmed civilians and the killing of intellectuals who supported independence from Pakistan. Mullah always denied the charges. Four other leading figures in Jamaat-e-Islami have also been convicted by the ICT and face the death penalty.

His family were allowed a final meeting with the 65-year-old and found him \"calm\". \"He told us that he is proud to be a martyr for the cause of the Islamic movement in the country,\" his son, Hasan Jamil, told the AFP after the meeting.

Security has been tightened in Dhaka and around the country amid fears the execution is likely to inflame tensions. At least three people are reported to have died on Thursday in sporadic clashes between Jamaat-e-Islami supporters and security forces. Human rights concerns Bangladesh broke away from Pakistan 42 years ago after a war which saw killings on a mass scale, the exodus of more than 10 million refugees and military intervention by neighbouring India. The government set up the special court to deal with those accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces who attempted to stop East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then, from becoming an independent country. The two wings of Pakistan were held together mostly by a shared religion. While many Bangladeshis have welcomed the work of the ICT, Jamaat supporters say it is a politically-motivated attempt to eradicate its leaders. Human rights groups have also expressed concern that the special court falls short of international standards. UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay had written to the Bangladeshi authorities urging them to stay the execution of Abdul Kader Mullah, saying the trial had not met the international standards required for the death penalty. Mullah had been scheduled to be hanged on Tuesday, before gaining a reprieve pending a last-minute appeal against his death sentence. His appeal was dismissed earlier on Thursday by the Bangladeshi Supreme Court. Jamaat is barred from contesting elections scheduled for 5 January but plays a key role in the opposition movement led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).",

    "text": "Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 \"was not manmade or genetically modified\". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. What did Trump say? At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: \"Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?\" \"Yes, I have. Yes, I have,\" said the president, without specifying. \"And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.\" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: \"I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.\" He also told reporters: \"Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? \"I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.\" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News. What did the intelligence service say? In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the \"wide scientific consensus\" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. \"The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. What is the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. What are Trump's accusations against China? Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before? In January, he called US intelligence agencies \"naive\" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens. The right moment for this fight? President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.",

The statement gave Saudis fighting in Syria 15 days to return. A royal decree issued last month said any citizen found guilty of fighting in conflicts abroad faced a jail sentence. Hundreds of Saudis are believed to be fighting in Syria, and correspondents say Riyadh fears they could pose a security risk when they return home. Although the kingdom has supported the Sunni-led rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, it has long feared a backlash from radical jihadist groups. Last month, King Abdullah decreed jail terms of up to 20 years for anyone belonging to \"terrorist groups\" or fighting abroad. The interior ministry also said the Saudi branch of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah was now banned. The new law also promised tough sanctions for anyone backing the incriminated organisations. However, rights group Amnesty International has criticised the legislation, saying it could be used to suppress peaceful political dissent. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia joined the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in withdrawing its ambassadors from Qatar, which it sees as an important supporter of the Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood is already banned in Saudi Arabia, which has long viewed its ideology of populist Islam as a threat. Analysts say the Brotherhood's conservative Sunni doctrines are seen as a challenge to the Saudi principle of dynastic rule. In Egypt, the Brotherhood has been driven underground since the army deposed President Mohammed Morsi, a longtime member of the group. The military-backed government in Cairo designated the Brotherhood a terrorist group in December.

    "text": "Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said a tweet by Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher was \"insulting\" to Russians and Americans. On Monday she tweeted: \"Dear President Putin, Hitler and Stalin colluded to start WWII.\" President Vladimir Putin says Poland and its allies are distorting history. During a marathon news conference on 19 December, the Russian president said it was \"totally unacceptable and inaccurate\" to cast equal blame on Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin for the war's outbreak. Mr Putin said he had requested Soviet archive documents in order to write an article on the subject - Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 - and, in his view, to set the record straight. He argued that the Western powers and Poland had appeased Hitler's aggression by letting him grab Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Nazi invasion of Poland came just a week after Hitler's Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had signed a non-aggression pact on 23 August 1939, which stunned the world. A secret clause in the pact carved up Eastern Europe into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence, allowing the two dictators - one fascist, the other communist - to occupy and dismantle Poland. Ms Mosbacher's tweet recalled that Poland was a victim of the two dictators. But Mr Volodin, who is close to Mr Putin, said the US state department ought to make sure that an ambassador such as Ms Mosbacher had sufficient knowledge of a country's history before sending her to work there. Mr Putin has revived wartime Soviet symbols, and portraits of Stalin are commonly displayed in Russia now. In 2020, the 75th anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany will be marked. More than 20 million Soviet citizens died in what Russians call the \"Great Patriotic War\" after the Nazis invaded the USSR in 1941. Mr Putin's father served in Stalin's NKVD secret police and was severely wounded in the war in 1942. President Putin argued that Stalin had tried to forge an anti-Hitler alliance with Britain, France and Poland, but that the Munich Agreement in 1938 - dooming Czechoslovakia - had scuppered that plan. Stalin then had to reach a deal with Hitler, feeling betrayed by the West, he argued. However, Western historians point out that the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact meant Hitler did not have to fear a clash with the USSR if he invaded Poland, so giving him the assurance he needed. Moreover, Stalin then supplied the Nazi war machine with raw materials, which helped fuel - literally - Hitler's aggression against Western Europe. How has this row escalated? Monday, 30 December: Besides the tweet by the US ambassador, Germany's ambassador to Poland - Rolf Nikel - also wades into the row, tweeting: \"The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland.\" 29 December: Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issues a statement accusing Mr Putin of using the World War Two issue as a means to cover up recent international setbacks for Russia, such as the sports sanctions imposed over Russian doping. Mr Morawiecki says \"President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions\". 27 December: Poland's foreign ministry summons the Russian ambassador to protest, recalling that the war began with the Nazi-Soviet pact, and that Poland lost about six million citizens in the war. Earlier, Mr Putin had scorned Poland and Western powers for appeasing Hitler and had labelled Poland's ambassador to Berlin in the 1930s an \"anti-Semitic swine\". 19 September: A European Parliament resolution - politically significant, but not a law - urges EU states to \"make a clear and principled assessment of the crimes and acts of aggression perpetrated by the totalitarian communist regimes and the Nazi regime\". It describes the war as \"an immediate result\" of the infamous Nazi-Soviet deal in 1939.",

    "text": "In 2009, when I was 18 years old, I was at a friend's house having fun and dancing with other girls. In Egypt, girls don't have anywhere to dance in public, so we dance together behind closed doors. I asked one of my friends to record a video of me dancing on my mobile phone. There was nothing pornographic about this video, but I was wearing a short dress that revealed my body. A few days later, I sent it to my boyfriend. In Europe or the US this would not be a big deal. But I come from an ordinary Muslim family in the Nile delta and, like most Egyptian girls, I had been raised to believe that no man has the right to see my body except my husband. At that time I was still wearing the hijab, the very emblem of female modesty, whenever I left the house. I knew that it was risky to send that kind of video to a man who was not my husband or even my fiance. But I sent it anyway. A while later I did something even riskier and sent him some private photos. By 2012 we had broken up. That's when the threats started. He said he would put the video and photos online if I didn't get back together with him. He knew that I was starting to build a public profile as a political activist and women's rights campaigner, and he thought he could use these images to destroy my career as well as my reputation. I was really frightened. I even thought my life might be in danger. In our society, the reputation of the whole family rests on the conduct of its daughters, sisters, and wives. Our bodies are not our own: they belong to the male members of the family, and are the vessels in which the family's honour is carried. I was scared that the video would bring shame on my parents, that our friends and neighbours would condemn my father for failing to raise me as a \"good girl\". I begged my ex-boyfriend not to publish the photos or the video. About a year later, in early 2013, I was talking with friends and mentioned that I loved dancing. I'll never forget the reply from one of the men in the group. \"I know,\" he said. \"I've seen you dancing on YouTube.\" #ShameOnline This is one of a series of stories looking at a new and disturbing phenomenon - the use of private or sexually explicit images to threaten, blackmail and shame young people, mainly girls and women, in some of the world's most conservative societies. You can explore all the stories and contribute to the conversation here. My ex had not only uploaded the dancing video - he had also made a video montage out of the private photographs and uploaded that as well. I managed to get YouTube to take down the video showing these photos, but the dancing video was still online. Secretly, I contacted a friend who is a lawyer and asked if there was anything in Egyptian law that would allow me to press charges. He encouraged me to file a complaint for defamation. The next day I reported my ex-boyfriend to the police. My family still knew nothing of this, and I was hoping to keep it that way. But a few months later, when I was on my way from Cairo back to my parents' home town, I received a phone call from my mum. Worried by the involvement of the law, my ex-boyfriend had gone to my father and told him everything. He had even shown my dad the private photos to prove that he had seen my body, and then offered to \"restore\" the family's honour by marrying me - on the condition, of course, that I drop the charges. I can definitely say that this was the worst marriage proposal I have ever received. The absurdity of this offer - a legal settlement wrapped up as a marriage proposal - lays bare the assumptions that restrict the sexual freedom of women in Egypt and across the Arab world. Family honour is inextricably linked to female sexual purity. If that purity is compromised in any way, honour can only be restored through marriage - or, in extreme cases, through murder. Some countries apply the same logic even in cases of rape. Jordan, for example, still has a law, Article 308, which exempts rapists from prosecution or punishment if they agree to marry their victims. When I got home, my mother was distraught. \"You have shamed us,\" she said. I left and got on the bus back to Cairo, where I had been living for a while. I was convinced that I had lost my family. But after a few kilometres, I told the bus driver to stop and let me off. I went home again to my parents and asked them to help me put it right. \"I can't fix this without your support,\" I told them. My father was furious with me for sending the video to a stranger. I tried to argue that the fault lay not with me, but with the man who had violated my privacy. He looked totally unconvinced. But despite the immense social pressures that they were under, my parents supported me in my fight for the right to privacy, and in 2014 my ex-boyfriend was convicted for defamation and sentenced in absentia to one year in jail. The legal situation was muddied by counter charges that, in an attempt to derail the case, he had filed against me in a separate dispute over money. In the end, exhausted by the whole procedure, I decided to withdraw my complaint. His conviction was annulled and he was never arrested or jailed. But the fact that a judge had examined the case and found him guilty was enough for me. The blackmailing was over. I thought I could forget about the video and get on with my life. I was wrong. Back in 2012, exactly one year after the Egyptian uprising and the protests in Tahrir square, I had founded a group called Girls' Revolution. It began as a hashtag on Twitter, and then grew into a movement of young women campaigning for change. We felt we had no real rights in Egypt, that we were merely tolerated as guests in our own country. Around the same time I decided to take off the hijab and started to become more outspoken - on Facebook, in TV debates and elsewhere - about the situation of women in Egypt. This drew hostility from some men, who began to insult me on social media. In October 2014, one of these trolls posted a link to the dancing video, with a comment saying, \"This is Ghadeer Ahmed, who wants to corrupt our Egyptian girls, and here is the video that shows that she herself is a slut.\" For me, that was breaking point. I was exploding with rage. I thought, \"No. I refuse to be blackmailed, I refuse to be threatened, I refuse to be shamed for having a female body. I will never again feel guilty about my own body, or frightened of what I do with it.\" So I took the dancing video and posted it on my own Facebook page for the whole world to see. The post I wrote to accompany it said: \"Yesterday a group of men tried to shame me by sharing a private video of me dancing with friends. I am writing this to announce that, yes, it was me in the video, and no, I am not ashamed of my body. To whoever is trying to stigmatise me, as a feminist I've got over the social misconceptions about women's bodies that still dominate Eastern societies. I don't feel ashamed because I was dancing happily, just as I did publicly at my sister's wedding, where I also wore a very short and revealing dress. Now, I want to ask you guys: what is it that really annoys you? Me being a slut, or me being a slut without sleeping with you? My body is not a source of shame. I have nothing to regret about this video.\" Immediately, the post went viral in Egypt. A lot of people said how brave I was, and agreed with my argument that a woman must have rights over her own body, as well as the right not to be exposed online. I received calls from my close friends offering their support. Finally, after five years, I felt that I had put an end to all the fear. I closed the door on it all. Two years on, I have no regrets about posting that video. Every now and then a girl has to break the mould that girls are put in. A girl has to stand up and say \"Yes, I've been blackmailed with private images, yes, I sent them of my own free will, but still no-one has the right to use them to shame or humiliate me.\" I am sharing my story now to encourage the thousands of girls all over the world who are still being threatened and blackmailed with digital images on social media. Here is what I want to say to you: You are not alone. I went through what you are struggling for. I felt lonely, I felt helpless, I felt weak and ashamed. There were times when I collapsed during this whole exhausting experience. I do not have the right to tell you to fight as I did, but I am urging you to ask for help from someone you trust. Once we ask for help, we feel less alone, less endangered. Together, we can change the culture that makes us frightened and ashamed. Together, we can survive. Together, as sisters, we can turn the world into a safer place for women. Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

    "text": "He was charged with molesting seven girls, many of whom are gymnasts, while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. As part of the plea deal, Nassar, 54, could face at least 25 years in prison. The hearing comes after a third former US Olympian, Gabby Douglas, accused him of sexual abuse. Douglas reveals abuse by team doctor In a statement to the court on Wednesday, Nassar said he was pleading guilty to \"move the community forward and stop the hurting\". \"I'm so sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire, out of control,\" he said. \"I want them to heal. I want this community to heal. I have no animosity toward any one. I just want healing. It's time.\" \"You used that position of trust that you had in the most vile way - to abuse children,\" Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said, noting that sex abuse is a nationwide \"epidemic\". \"You violated the oath that you took, which is to do no harm, and you harmed them. Selfishly.\" Many of his accusers testified that they were abused while he was examining the young athletes, and sometimes while their parents were nearby. He has been accused of abusing more than 130 women - including Olympic gold medalists Ms Douglas, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney - during his time as team doctor for the US women's gymnastics team. Ms Douglas, who was one of the so-called Fierce Five that won gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, revealed her accusation on Instagram. \"I didn't publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful,\" she wrote. During the hearing Ms Raisman, a member of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, tweeted that she was \"disgusted\" that Nassar, who lost his licence, was referred to as a doctor. Nassar's case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year. Mr Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations. In a statement after the plea deal was announced, USA Gymnastics - the organisation which determines the US Olympic team - said it is \"very sorry that any athlete was harmed\" by their former doctor. They added that it was \"important\" that he acknowledged \"his appalling and devious conduct\" in court and said the deal \"permits punishment without further victimisation of survivors\". Nassar has already pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child pornography in federal court and could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before accepting the plea, Judge Aquilina asked him to confirm that he did not wear gloves when abusing his victims between 1998 and 2015, when he was fired. The alleged examinations were \"not for any medical purposes is that right? It was for your own purpose, is that right?\", the judge asked. Nassar responded: \"Yes.\" He is due to be sentenced on 12 January.",

    "text": "The 83-year-old emperor said last year that his age and health were making it hard for him to fulfil his official duties. But there is no provision under existing law for him to abdicate and be succeeded by Crown Prince Naruhito. The bill will now pass to the parliament, where it is widely expected to be passed. It would be the first time a Japanese emperor has stepped down since Emperor Kokaku in 1817. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Friday that the government \"hopes for the smooth passage of the legislation\". Akihito, who has had heart surgery and was treated for prostate cancer, has been on the throne since the death of his father, Hirohito, in 1989 and is loved and revered by many Japanese. In a rare address to the nation in August, he said he was beginning to feel \"various constraints such as in my physical fitness\" which caused him to \"contemplate on my role and my duties as the emperor in the days to come\". The emperor is constitutionally barred from making any comments on politics, so he could not say explicitly that he wanted to stand down. The bill approved by the cabinet on Friday mentions the widespread public support for the emperor's wishes, Japanese media reported. It says that on abdication, Crown Prince Naruhito would immediately take the Chrysanthemum Throne, but that neither he nor his successors would be allowed to abdicate under the same law. The government will set the date for the abdication, which is expected to be in December 2018. Dwindling household - By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Tokyo Japan's royal household has not always been so strict. Once emperors were allowed to retire. There have also been at least eight female occupants of the throne. But in 1866 Japan underwent the \"Meiji Restoration\", a very Japanese revolution. The emperor was brought from seclusion in Kyoto and placed on the throne in Tokyo. He was declared a god-emperor. There would be no more female succession, and the god-emperor would reign for life. In 1947, following Japan's defeat, the rules changed again. The emperor would now be an ordinary man with no political power. The size of the royal household was cut. In future any royal woman marrying a 'commoner' would leave the imperial household. But the rule on emperors serving for life stayed, and so did the ban on women ascending the throne. Now we have an emperor who wants to retire, and a royal household rapidly dwindling in numbers. Of Emperor Akihito's four grandchildren, only one is a boy. This week the engagement of Princess Mako, his eldest grandchild, was revealed. When she marries she will leave the royal family, as will her sister, Princess Kako, and her cousin, Princess Aiko. And so only Prince Hisahito, 10, will remain to carry on the 2,500-year-old imperial line. Women are not allowed to inherit the throne and so Princess Aiko, the daughter of Crown Prince Naruhito, cannot succeed her father. A debate about whether or not a woman should be able to ascend the throne was triggered in 2006 when the emperor had no grandsons, but was postponed after a boy was born to the imperial family. The discussion about the role of royal women arose again when it was announced that Princess Mako, 25, was to be engaged to a commoner, law firm employee Kei Komuro.

    "text": "Keepers at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington DC only discovered Mei Xiang was pregnant during an ultrasound scan last week. The zoo said both cubs appeared healthy. Giant pandas are one of the most endangered species in the world and are notoriously hard to breed in captivity. The National Zoo is one of only four zoos in the US to have pandas, which are on loan from China. Mei Xiang, who has two other offspring, is one of the zoo's star attractions and a Panda Cam on her enclosure crashed within seconds of the birth of the first cub being announced because of the volume of interest. Female pandas are able to conceive for only two or three days a year, leading to a very low reproduction rate. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated with sperm from the zoo's resident male Tian Tian and a panda named Hui Hui from Wolong, China. It will not be known for a while which is the father, or what sex the cubs are. It has previously taken months before Mei Xiang's cubs have been introduced to the public. AP news agency reports that her first cub, Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010; her second cub, Bao Bao, is two years old on Sunday and still lives at the zoo. The panda population is threatened by habitat loss as land is increasingly inhabited by humans, with about 1,800 pandas left in the wild in China. However, the number living in the wild in China has gone up over the last 10 years.",

    "text": "Just 3% of the collection is available for the public to view, said the Taxpayers' Alliance. Its freedom of information requests showed that one local council - Carlisle, in Cumbria - displayed just 0.02% of the 864,100 works it owned. The alliance called on the government to improve the number of works on show. It acknowledged that selling off items, many of which were bequeathed specifically to be put on public display, could be \"inappropriate\", but suggested councils could consider loaning artwork to schools and community centres. \"No one is proposing a wholesale sell-off of art owned by the government but, nonetheless, the scale of the collection is staggering,\" said Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the alliance. \"Public bodies and local authorities should make an effort to display more of their art for people to enjoy, and they also need to take a good, hard look at their art portfolio and think about what does and does not need to be retained.\" The most valuable item owned by the state is Henry VIII's armour for field and tournament, which was acquired by the Royal Armouries in 1649 and is now estimated to be worth £53.6 million. A painting by LS Lowry, called Lancashire Fair: Good Friday, Daisy Nook, is the most expensive item in the collection not owned by a gallery. Bought in 1947 for just £120, it is now worth an estimated £3.5 million. It currently hangs in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport - but has been loaned to several institutions, including Tate Britain, the Ulster Museum and The Lowry, over the last five years. It is also available to see on the BBC's Your Paintings site, which aims to catalogue every oil painting in the UK national collection. Analysis - Will Gompertz, BBC Arts Editor The suggestion here is that a valuable asset owned by the taxpayer is being mismanaged: If these artworks and artefacts are not being made available for the public to see, then sell them and put the money into the public coffers. But that overlooks one of the purposes for which people and authorities buy art, and that is PR or soft power. Go to almost any ambassador's official residence and you will see great examples of art from his or her home country. Their job is not to be merely decorative, but to communicate the values, status and culture of a country. It brings a certain credibility, authority and a confident swagger to proceedings. It is working hard for its place on the wall. That said, there is far, far too much art that is owned by authorities and museums that is merely gathering dust in storerooms across the country, which really ought to be made available to the public. There's many a school wall, for instance, that would benefit from a high quality art work. It would bring hidden benefits, just as the oil painting in the ambassador's residence does. Amongst local councils, Manchester City Council owns the most valuable collection - of 46,347 pieces, worth some £347 million. Of those, 1,017 (2.1%) are on display. North Hertfordshire council did not reveal how many pieces it owned, but it has the largest collection of any local authority, with \"over a million pieces\". The Taxpayers' Alliance also noted that, since austerity measures came into place, the government had continued to buy pieces for the national collection. Between 2010 and 2015, the state bought art worth £361,320, including a £40,000 sculpture by the contemporary Brtitish artist Mel Brimfield, and a £22,500 work by Jim Lamble. \"At a time when we are making necessary savings, it is only reasonable to ask whether some of the recent purchases represent value for taxpayers' money,\" said Mr Isaby. A spokesman from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the suggestion that only 3% of publicly-owned works were on display \"does not apply to the Government Art Collection, which has 58.3% of its artwork currently on display in British government buildings in the UK and around the world\". \"The works of art are seen by thousands of visitors including heads of state, public figures and the general public.\" The Government Art Collection was founded in 1898 to promote British art and culture to the world and includes more than 13,000 items, dating from the 16th Century to the present day. It includes works by, among others, John Constable, William Hogarth and Lucian Freud. Hundreds of them were displayed at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in 2010 and 2011; and members of the public can tour the collection by appointment.",

    "text": "The electoral commission said 92% of the 3.3 million Kurds and non-Kurds who cast their ballots supported secession. The announcement came despite a last-minute appeal for the result to be \"cancelled\" from Iraq's prime minister. Haider al-Abadi urged Kurds to instead engage in dialogue with Baghdad \"in the framework of the constitution\". Kurdish leaders say the \"Yes\" vote will give them a mandate to start negotiations on secession with the central government in Baghdad and neighbouring countries. Iraq's parliament meanwhile asked the prime minister to deploy troops to the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and other disputed areas held by Kurdish forces. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took control of Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic region claimed by the Kurds and Arab-led central government, when jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) swept across northern Iraq in 2014 and the Iraqi army collapsed. The referendum was held in the three Iraqi provinces that make up the Kurdistan Region, as well as \"areas of Kurdistan outside the region's administration\". Electoral commission officials told a news conference in Irbil on Wednesday afternoon that 2,861,000 people had voted \"yes\" to independence and 224,000 had voted \"no\". Turnout was 72.61% among those eligible to vote. In a speech to parliament before the result was announced, Mr Abadi insisted that he would \"never have a dialogue\" about the referendum's outcome with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The vote was vehemently opposed by Baghdad and much of the international community, which expressed concern about its potentially destabilising effects, particularly on the battle against IS. Mr Abadi said his priority now was to \"preserve citizens' security\" and promised to \"defend Kurdish citizens inside or outside\" the Kurdistan Region. \"We will impose Iraq's rule in all districts of the region with the force of the constitution,\" he added. The prime minister also reaffirmed his threat to prevent direct international flights to the Kurdistan Region if Baghdad was not given control of Irbil and Sulaimaniya airports by Friday afternoon. The KRG's transport minister said he was seeking clarification from Baghdad. \"We don't understand how to give them the two airports,\" Mowlud Murad told reporters. \"They are already subject to the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority.\" The United States, which was \"deeply disappointed\" that the referendum was held, has also questioned Mr Abadi's threat to ban international flights. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday that such a move \"would not be an example of engaging constructively\". Lebanon's Middle East Airlines and EgyptAir meanwhile warned customers they would halt flights to Irbil from Friday until further notice. Mr Abadi has also demanded control of all border crossings and oil revenues. Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East but they have never obtained a permanent nation state. In Iraq, where they make up an estimated 15% to 20% of the population of 37 million, Kurds faced decades of repression before acquiring autonomy in 1991.",

    "text": "By Laurel IvesBBC Health A large new global study published in the Lancet has confirmed previous research which has shown that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption. The researchers admit moderate drinking may protect against heart disease but found that the risk of cancer and other diseases outweighs these protections. A study author said its findings were the most significant to date because of the range of factors considered. How risky is moderate drinking? The Global Burden of Disease study looked at levels of alcohol use and its health effects in 195 countries, including the UK, between 1990 and 2016. Analysing data from 15 to 95-year-olds, the researchers compared people who did not drink at all with those who had one alcoholic drink a day. They found that out of 100,000 non-drinkers, 914 would develop an alcohol-related health problem such as cancer or suffer an injury. But an extra four people would be affected if they drank one alcoholic drink a day. For people who had two alcoholic drinks a day, 63 more developed a condition within a year and for those who consumed five drinks every day, there was an increase of 338 people, who developed a health problem. One of the study authors, Prof Sonia Saxena, a researcher at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said: \"One drink a day does represent a small increased risk, but adjust that to the UK population as a whole and it represents a far bigger number, and most people are not drinking just one drink a day.\" The lead author of the study Dr Max Griswold, at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said: \"Previous studies have found a protective effect of alcohol on some conditions, but we found that the combined health risks associated with alcohol increases with any amount of alcohol. \"The strong association between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer, injuries, and infectious diseases offset the protective effects for heart disease in our study. \"Although the health risks associated with alcohol start off being small with one drink a day, they then rise rapidly as people drink more.\" In 2016, the government cut the levels of alcohol it recommends for men and women to no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine. At the time, England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, noted that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer. 'Informed risk' Prof Saxena said the study was the most important study ever conducted on the subject. She explained: \"This study goes further than others by considering a number of factors including alcohol sales, self-reported data on the amount of alcohol drunk, abstinence, tourism data and the levels of illicit trade and home brewing.\" The study shows that British women drink an average of three drinks a day, and rank eighth in the world of highest drinkers. British men by contrast, ranked 62nd out of the 195 countries surveyed, even though they also drink on average three alcoholic drinks a day. This is because the drinking levels were far higher generally among men, with Romanian men drinking more than eight drinks daily. A drink was defined as 10g of alcohol, which equates to a small glass of wine, a can or bottle of beer, or a shot of spirits. In the UK one unit is 8g of alcohol. Around the world, one in three people are thought to drink alcohol and it is linked to nearly a tenth of all deaths in those aged 15 to 49. Prof Saxena said: \"Most of us in the UK drink well in excess of safe limits, and as this study shows there is no safe limit. The recommendations need to come down further and the government needs to rethink its policy. If you are going to drink, educate yourself about the risks, and take an informed risk.\" How many units of alcohol are in each drink? Source: NHS Choices Yet Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, sounded a note of caution about the findings. \"Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no 'safe' level does not seem an argument for abstention,\" he said. \"There is no safe level of driving, but the government does not recommend that people avoid driving. \"Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.\"",

    "text": "Ishaq, who had been detained last week, was in a police convoy in Punjab province when supporters opened fire in an attempt to free him, said police. They said Ishaq was killed in a gunfight along with his two sons and 11 militants in Muzaffargarh district. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) has been behind some of the most violent attacks on Shia Muslims in recent years. Punjab Home Minister Shuja Khanzada confirmed the news to AFP news agency, while a doctor at Muzaffargarh District Hospital said 14 bodies had been received there. Six police officers were also reported injured but correspondents say the extent of their injuries is unclear. Analysis: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The circumstances of Ishaq's killing are not clear, and many believe the gunfight may have been a \"fake encounter\", staged to kill a suspect who could be freed if taken to court. Many believe his death signifies an emerging need in the Pakistani establishment to control sectarian killings. The death comes as Pakistan is pushing for normalisation in Afghanistan and major Chinese funding for an economic corridor connecting China to the Arabian Sea. He was wanted in hundreds of sectarian killings but government prosecutors always failed to bring sufficient evidence to get him convicted in a court. The previous LeJ chief, Riaz Basra, was killed in a similar \"encounter\" with police in 2002. Ishaq, his two sons and other alleged members of LeJ were taken into custody by the Counter Terrorism Department several days ago in connection with eight recent sectarian killings. Late on Tuesday they were being led to Shahwala, on the outskirts of Muzaffargarh city, \"where they (prisoners) said they had hidden a cache of arms and ammo\", police said. Police claim the group was attacked by 12-15 armed men in an attempt to free the prisoners. All of them were killed in the ensuing gunfight, they said. Ishaq was in police custody for more than 13 years on over 70 charges of sectarian killings. He walked free in December 2014 after a decision by Lahore High Court. LeJ was banned in Pakistan in 2001 and designated a terrorist group by the US in 2003. It has claimed the killings of hundreds of mainly Shia civilians in Pakistan. Thwarted politician? Asif Farooqi, BBC Urdu, Islamabad Malik Ishaq attempted to join mainstream politics following his release from jail four years ago - but was prevented by internal power struggles in the Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) movement. While still in jail, he had started consultations about becoming a member of parliament. ASWJ head Mohammad Ahmed Ludhianvi persuaded him to shun violence and pursue his anti-Shia agenda through political means. Ishaq agreed and soon started taking part in the ASWJ's political activities. He had huge clout within the group and gained prominence within and outside the party in no time. However, threatened by Malik's rise, Ludhianvi ostracised him and his followers, pushing them back towards their militant roots. Malik was expelled from the ASWJ, taking with him the more violent elements of the organisation. There were bloody clashes between the Ludhianvi and Ishaq groups and both leaders escaped assassination attempts. Ultimately, Malik Ishaq was pushed back into Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and its militant agenda.",

    "text": "Germany's Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said \"many things\" pointed to a deliberate attack. Police said on Twitter that the lorry driver had been arrested, and that a passenger died from his injuries. The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in the city's west. Almost 50 people are in hospital and at least four have suffered serious injuries. Facebook set up a \"Safety Check\" page for people in Berlin to let others know they are safe. Attack as it happened Security sources cited by the German news agency DPA said that the driver of the truck was an asylum seeker from Afghanistan or Pakistan who had arrived in Germany in February. Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said a suspect believed to be the person driving the vehicle was picked up about a mile (2 kilometres) away from the crash site, near Berlin's Victory Column monument, and was being interrogated. Images of the lorry show that it was registered in neighbouring Poland. Police believe it may have been stolen from a construction site there. Police said the passenger who died was Polish. Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday. \"We haven't heard from him since this afternoon,\" he told the AFP news agency. \"We don't know what happened to him. He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him.\" Was it a terror attack? German politicians have been unwilling to call the deadly crash a terrorist attack at this stage, while many of the details remain unverified or unclear. Interior Minister Mr de Maiziere told ARD television: \"I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although many things speak for it. \"There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel has been briefed by the interior minister and the mayor of Berlin, her spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. \"We are in mourning for the dead and hope that the many injured can get help,\" he added. German President Joachim Gauck said in a statement that Monday was an \"awful evening for Berlin and for our country\". The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the Christmas market at one of the most crowded times, crashing through wooden huts and stands filled with tourists and locals. According to the DPA news agency, police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (54-87 yards) through the market area during the incident, which occurred at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT). A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press at the scene that the large lorry had missed him by only about 3m as it smashed through stands and tore down a large Christmas tree. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" said the tourist, visiting from Birmingham. He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed \"blood and bodies everywhere\". \"I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed. \"I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there.\" The site where the chaos unfolded is near a famous Berlin landmark - the Gedaechtniskirche, or memorial church, built in 1891-95. The church was damaged in World War Two bombing raids, and left as a ruin with a jagged tower as a monument to peace and reconciliation. Memories of Nice A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Monday's incident evoked memories of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, when 86 people were killed. That attack was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS). Both IS and al-Qaida have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds. Reacting to the news from Berlin, Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi tweeted: \"Horror in Berlin. Support for the mayor of Berlin and the German people. never again.\" The United States labelled the tragedy an apparent \"terrorist attack\" and pledged its support. President-elect Donald Trump blamed \"Islamist terrorists\" for a \"slaughter\" of Christians in the German capital. \"Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!\" he tweeted. Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened? You can email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your experiences.

    "text": "By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Kabul How did we get here? And why did it take so long? The Afghan war has been a bloody stalemate for years now, with the Taliban increasingly controlling or contesting more territory, yet unable to capture and hold major urban centres. There seems to have been a growing realisation, both amongst the group's leadership and in the US that neither side is capable of an outright military victory. President Trump, meanwhile, has been clear about his desire to withdraw American troops from the country. One key concession by the US, which allowed negotiations to take place, was the decision in 2018 to change its longstanding policy that the Taliban should talk first of all to the Afghan government, who the insurgents dismiss as illegitimate. Instead the US sat down directly with the Taliban to address their chief public demand - the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. Those negotiations led to Saturday's accord, with the Taliban agreeing in exchange to address the core reason for the US invasion in 2001, the group's links to al-Qaeda. This deal now opens the door to separate, wider talks between the militants and other Afghan political leaders - including government figures. Those discussions will be much more challenging. Somehow there will have to be a reconciliation between the Taliban's vision of an \"Islamic Emirate\" and the democratic modern Afghanistan that has been created since 2001. Where does that leave women's rights? What is the Taliban's stance on democracy? These are questions that will only be answered when the \"intra-Afghan talks\" begin. Up until now, the Taliban have been, perhaps deliberately, vague. There are possible obstacles even before those talks begin. The Taliban want 5,000 of their prisoners released before they start. The Afghan government wants to use those detainees as a bargaining chip in the talks to persuade the Taliban to agree to a ceasefire. Then there's the ongoing political dispute over the results of the presidential election - with Ashraf Ghani's rival Abdullah Abdullah alleging fraud. A backdrop of political instability could make it harder to establish the \"inclusive\" negotiating team international observers want to see sitting across the table from the Taliban. One Afghan official admitted to me that even when they start, the \"intra-Afghan\" negotiations could take years. But the US has signalled its intent to withdraw all its forces within 14 months if the Taliban fulfil their side of the agreement. It is not immediately clear if that means the US will stay on beyond that time, if no settlement has been reached. Afghan officials have emphasised the pullout is \"conditional\", but one diplomat told me withdrawal was only contingent on the \"intra-Afghan talks\" starting, not concluding. He expressed concern that if the US were to pull forces out and the Taliban decided to up the ante on the battlefield, Afghan forces would be left extremely vulnerable. Other analysts have warned that the Taliban doesn't appear to be in the mood for concessions, presenting the agreement today to their supporters as a \"victory\". The Taliban do however appear to want international legitimacy and recognition. The fanfare around the ceremony in Doha has given them that, and they may feel negotiations offer the best chance of achieving their aims. The priority for many ordinary Afghans, at least in the short term, is a substantive reduction in violence. We'll find out in the coming weeks, when the warmer spring weather generally heralds the start of \"fighting season\", if that will happen.",

    "text": "By Rebecca MorelleScience reporter, BBC World Service Researchers have found that space rocks of a similar size to the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk are hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere with surprising frequency. Scientists say early warning systems need to be put in place. The study is published in the journal Nature. Lead author Professor Peter Brown, from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action programme: \"Having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the Earth, that probably is something worth doing. \"In the case of Chelyabinsk, a few days' to a week's warning would have been valuable.\" Fireball The asteroid that exploded over Russia on 15 February this year was estimated to be about 19m-wide. It hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, sending a shockwave twice around the globe. It caused widespread damage and injured more than 1,000 people. Now though, scientists say there could be many more space rocks like this one on a collision course with the Earth. An international team looked at the last 20 years of data collected from sensors used by the US government and infrasound sensors positioned around the globe. These detectors are in place to detect the threat of nuclear weapons, but they can also capture the blasts caused by asteroid impacts. The researchers found that during this time about 60 asteroids up to 20m in size had smashed into the Earth's atmosphere: far more than was previously thought Most went undetected because they exploded over the ocean or in very remote areas. Prof Brown explained: \"We were able to capture the occurrence rate you would expect of things like Chelyabinsk and smaller impacts. When you compare that to the numbers you get from telescopic [observations], our numbers are several times higher.\" This suggests that the risk from asteroids of this scale has been underestimated. The team estimates that the strike rate of asteroids that are tens of metres in size is between two and 10 times higher than was previously thought. \"Something like Chelyabinsk, you would only expect every 150 years on the basis of the telescopic information. But when you look at our data and extrapolate from that, we see that these things seem to be happening every 30 years or so,\" said Prof Brown. An event such as the Tunguska impact in 1908, where an asteroid flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest in Siberia, would probably happen every few hundred years rather than every few thousand years, he added. Prof Brown said more effort should be made to create early warning systems. \"There are literally millions of objects in the tens-of-metres-of-size range that we suspect are near Earth asteroids, that can get close to the Earth,\" he said. \"We have only discovered over 1,000 of these. There are many more of these to find, but it would be very expensive to find all of these and it probably wouldn't make a lot of sense because the atmosphere largely stops them. \"But what might make sense are systems that find something a few days or weeks before they hit... to tell you where on the Earth and when they will hit. That would allow some warning to be given to the civil defence authorities.\" In another study, also published in Nature, scientists believe they have traced the asteroid that the Chelyabinsk meteor splintered off from. They think it is a fragment of a 2km-wide rock called asteroid 86039. Professor Jiri Borovicka, from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said the orbits were \"conspicuously similar\", although the team could not prove \"the common origin with absolute certainty\".

The research will take place at the Francis Crick Institute in London and aims to provide a deeper understanding of the earliest moments of human life. It will be illegal for the scientists to implant the modified embryos into a woman. But the field is attracting controversy over concerns it is opening the door to designer - or GM - babies. DNA is the blueprint of life - the instructions for building the human body. Gene editing allows the precise manipulation of DNA. In a world-first last year, scientists in China announced they had carried out gene editing in human embryos to correct a gene that causes a blood disorder. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, a scientific advisor to the UK's fertility regulator, told the BBC: \"China has guidelines, but it is often unclear exactly what they are until you've done it and stepped over an unclear boundary. \"This is the first time it has gone through a properly regulatory system and been approved.\" Groundbreaking The experiments will take place in the first seven days after fertilisation. During this time we go from a fertilised egg to a structure called a blastocyst, containing 200-300 cells. The work will be led by Dr Kathy Niakan, who has spent a decade researching human development. Earlier this year, she explained why she had applied to edit human embryos: \"We would really like to understand the genes needed for a human embryo to develop successfully into a healthy baby. \"The reason why it is so important is because miscarriages and infertility are extremely common, but they're not very well understood.\" Out of every 100 fertilised eggs, fewer than 50 reach the early blastocyst stage, 25 implant into the womb and only 13 develop beyond three months. And at the blastocyst stage, some cells have been organised to perform specific roles - some go on to form the placenta, others the yolk sac and others ultimately us. How and why this takes place is unknown - but some parts of our DNA are highly active at this stage. It is likely these genes are guiding our early development, but it is unclear exactly what they are doing or what goes wrong in miscarriage. The researchers will alter these genes in donated embryos, which will be destroyed after seven days. The regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), has given its approval and the experiments could start in the next few months. Arguments Paul Nurse, the director of the Crick, said: \"I am delighted that the HFEA has approved Dr Niakan's application. \"Dr Niakan's proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development.\" Dr David King, the director of Human Genetics Alert, said: \"This research will allow the scientists to refine the techniques for creating GM babies, and many of the government's scientific advisers have already decided that they are in favour of allowing that. \"So this is the first step in a well mapped-out process leading to GM babies, and a future of consumer eugenics.\" Dr Sarah Chan, from the University of Edinburgh, said: \"The use of genome editing technologies in embryo research touches on some sensitive issues, therefore it is appropriate that this research and its ethical implications have been carefully considered by the HFEA before being given approval to proceed. \"We should feel confident that our regulatory system in this area is functioning well to keep science aligned with social interests.\" Follow James on Twitter.",

    "text": "By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing The government denies that it is attempting to alter the demographics of its far-western region and says the job transfers are designed to raise incomes and alleviate chronic rural unemployment and poverty. But our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking. The study, which was meant for the eyes of senior officials but accidentally placed online, forms part of a BBC investigation based on propaganda reports, interviews, and visits to factories across China. And we ask questions about the possible connections between transferred Uighur labour and two major western brands, as international concern mounts over the extent to which it is already ingrained in global supply chains. In a village in southern Xinjiang, hay is being gathered in the fields and families are placing fruit and flatbreads on their supas, the low platforms around which Uighur family life has traditionally revolved. But the warm wind blowing across the Taklamakan desert is bringing with it worry and change. The video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away. After two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house. What follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes. Although it was broadcast in 2017, around the time the policy began to be intensified, the video has not featured in international news reporting until now. The officials speak to one father who is clearly reluctant to send his daughter, Buzaynap, so far away. \"There must be someone else who'd like to go,\" he tries to plead. \"We can make our living here, let us live a life like this.\" They speak directly to 19-year old Buzaynap, telling her that, if she stays she will be married soon and never able to leave. \"Have a think, will you go?\" they ask. Under the intense scrutiny of the government officials and state-TV journalists she shakes her head and replies, \"I won't go.\" Still, the pressure continues until eventually, weeping, she concedes. \"I'll go if others go,\" she says. The film ends with tearful goodbyes between mothers and daughters as Buzaynap and other similarly \"mobilised\" recruits leave their family and culture behind. Professor Laura Murphy is an expert in human rights and contemporary slavery at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University who lived in Xinjiang between 2004 and 2005 and has visited since. \"This video is remarkable,\" she told the BBC. \"The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist.\" \"The other thing it shows is this ulterior motive,\" she said, \"that although the narrative is one of lifting people out of poverty, there's a drive to entirely change people's lives, to separate families, disperse the population, change their language, their culture, their family structures, which is more likely to increase poverty than to decrease it.\" A marked shift in China's approach to its governance of Xinjiang can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters - in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - which it blamed on Uighur Islamists and separatists. At the heart of its response - in both the camps and the work transfer schemes - has been a drive to replace \"old\" Uighur loyalties to culture and the Islamic faith with a \"modern\" materialist identity and an enforced allegiance to the Communist Party. This overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC. Based on field work conducted in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture in May 2018, the report was inadvertently made publicly available online in December 2019 and then subsequently taken down a few months later. Written by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are \"an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities\" and bring about a \"transformation of their thinking.\" Uprooting them and relocating them elsewhere in the region or in other Chinese provinces, it says, \"reduces Uighur population density.\" The report was discovered online by an overseas-based Uighur who passed it to Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington. Before the university realized its error, Dr Zenz saved the report (in Chinese) on a web-archive site and has now written his own analysis of it, which includes an English translation of the full document. \"This is an unprecedented, authoritative source written by leading academics and former government officials with high-level access to Xinjiang itself,\" Dr Zenz told the BBC. \"The excess surplus population that somehow has to be dealt with, and labour transfers as a means to reduce the concentration of those workers in their own heartlands is, in my opinion, the most stunning admission of this report.\" His analysis includes a legal opinion from Erin Farrell Rosenberg, a former senior advisor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, that the Nankai Report provides \"credible grounds\" for the crimes against humanity of forcible transfer and persecution. In a written statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said, \"The report reflects only the author's personal view and much of its contents are not in line with the facts.\" \"We hope that journalists will use the authoritative information released by the Chinese government as the basis for reporting on Xinjiang.\" The Nankai report authors write glowingly of an effort to combat poverty underwritten by a \"guarantee of voluntariness\" in the work placements, and with the factories allowing the workers to \"leave and return freely.\" But those claims are somewhat at odds with the level of detail they provide about the way the policy works in practice. There are \"targets\" to be reached, with Hotan Prefecture alone - at the time the study was undertaken - having already exported 250,000 workers, one fifth of its total working age population. There is pressure to meet the targets, with recruiting stations set up \"in every village\" and officials tasked to \"mobilize collectively\" and \"visit households,\" just as in 19-year-old Buzaynap's case. And there are signs of control at every stage, with all recruits put through \"political thought education,\" then transported to the factories in groups - sometimes as many as hundreds at a time - and \"led and accompanied by political cadres in order to implement security and management.\" Farmers unwilling to leave their lands or herds behind are encouraged to transfer them to a centralized government scheme that manages them in their absence. And once they arrive in their new factory jobs, workers themselves are put under the \"centralized management\" of officials who \"eat and live\" with them. But the report also notes that the profound discrimination at the heart of the system is getting in the way of its effective functioning, with local police forces in eastern China so alarmed by the arrival of trainloads of Uighurs, that they are sometimes turned back. In places, it even warns that China's policies in Xinjiang may have been too extreme, for example, stating that the number of people placed in the re-education camps \"far exceeds\" those with suspected connections to extremism. \"The entire Uighur population should not be assumed to be rioters,\" it says. The Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui. It was to this factory that Buzaynap, featured in the state-TV report, was sent. When the BBC visited, the separate, five-story Uighur dormitory showed few signs of habitation apart from a pair of shoes placed by an open window. At the gate, the security guard said that the Uighur workers \"have gone back home,\" adding that it was because of the country's Covid controls, and in a statement Huafu told us that, \"the company does not currently employ Xinjiang workers.\" The BBC was able to find pillowcases made with Huafu yarn on sale on Amazon's UK website, although it is not possible to confirm if the product is linked to the particular factory we visited, or one of the company's other facilities. Amazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale. The BBC worked with a group of international journalists based in China, visiting a total of six factories between us. At the Dongguan Luzhou Shoes factory in Guangdong Province, one worker said the Uighur employees used separate dormitories and their own canteen, and another local told reporters that the company makes shoes for Skechers. The factory has previously been linked to the US company, with unverified social media videos purportedly showing Uighur workers making Skechers product lines, and references to a relationship in online Chinese business directories. In a statement, Skechers said it had \"zero tolerance for forced labour,\" but did not answer questions about whether it used Dongguan Luzhou as a supplier. Dongguan Luzhou did not respond to a request for comment. Interviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed. In at least two cases, reporters were told of some restrictions, and at one facility in the city of Wuhan a Han Chinese employee told the BBC that his 200 or so Uighur colleagues were not allowed out at all. Three months after Buzaynap was shown leaving her village to begin her political education training, the Chinese state-TV crew meet her again, this time in the Huafu Textile Company in Anhui. The theme of assimilation is, once again, central to the news report. In one scene, Buzaynap is close to tears as she is scolded for her mistakes, but eventually, a transformation is said to be taking place. \"The timid girl who didn't speak and kept her head down,\" we are told, \"is gaining authority at work.\" \"Lifestyles are changing and thoughts are changing.\" Producer: Kathy Long",

    "text": "By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter No spoilers, but we've seen the first episode and as sequels go we can confirm it's better than Sex And The City 2. We've also been to the press conference and spoken to some of the team behind the new series. Here are 22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II - complete with behind-the-boat info and what you can expect from the first episode. 1. Five babies were born to crew members in the time it took to film. Blue Planet II involved \"125 shoots, 6,000 hours filming underwater and 1,000 hours filming in submersibles\", explains production manager Katie Hall. But away from the shoots, she adds, it was also a busy time for the crew: \"We had three weddings. Four houses were bought. Five babies. Two babies on the way. \"That's what happens when you're filming for four years.\" 2. \"Oceans cover 70% of the surface of our planet, and yet they are still the least explored,\" says Sir David Attenborough in the opening sequence. \"Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination,\" he continues. Roughly translated, we think he's saying: \"Look, I know you might have seen Finding Dory multiple times but this is the real deal.\" 3. Hans Zimmer is doing the music again. It's bad news for Fifth Harmony fans as the soundtrack has already been sorted by composer and general legend Hans Zimmer. \"We actually put the music out to tender, we weren't sure who we wanted to do it,\" explains executive producer James Honeyborne. \"And although we loved Planet Earth II [which Zimmer also did the soundtrack for] we wanted to keep this feeling fresh. \"But Hans came to us with such an impassioned pitch as to why he wanted to do it, which was incredible.\" 4. There will be seven episodes in the series. And they're split into different habitats - like deep ocean, the coral reefs, the open ocean and the coastlines. \"Once you start dividing those up, you start to see where some of the stories would naturally fit,\" says James. 5. We wouldn't fancy filling out the risk assessment form for this show. \"When we green light each shoot, we're constantly mitigating risk,\" says Katie. \"But bar a couple of earaches, a little bit of water at the bottom of a submersible, and one cameraman stubbed his finger, we were extraordinarily lucky. \"But the planning that goes into every single shoot, and managing the risk - whether that's financial risk or health and safety - you don't see any of that.\" Shame. 6. There's some serious drama in the opening episode. Spoiler alert etc, etc. In the opening episode, we meet some birds. Who sometimes like to fly down to the ocean and chill out a bit on the surface. Unfortunately for them, there's some rather hungry giant trevallies (ie big scary fish) lurking under the water. And they have a particular taste for birds. We won't give much more away, but it's safe to say you're about to see some snakes and iguanas-level drama go down. 7. Fish are Facebook-friendly. The trailer for the new series has already built up 43 million views on social media. Which is all part of a new digital strategy this year, according to Tom McDonald, who is (deep breath) head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History and Specialist Factual unit. \"One of the interesting things about Planet Earth II was that more people watched it than the X Factor results show when they were up against each other last year,\" he says. \"So if there is a younger audience out there that is going to consume natural history content, we should focus our digital strategy on them, which is what we've done this year.\" 8. New technology was built to film the series. \"We built a huge piece of housing which we called the megadome which allowed us to slice the sea in half so you can see above and below at the same time,\" James says. \"We also built a tow-cam which can be pulled behind a boat which allowed us to travel with really fast-moving animals like dolphins and tuna.\" 9. They've brought back those 'making of' segments at the end of the episodes. Remember on Planet Earth II, you'd get 50 minutes worth of TV show, and then 10 minutes of how the episode you've just seen was shot? Half the time, the \"making of\" bit was even more interesting and eventful than the show itself. Well, they've brought that bit back - and this series will have a segment called Into The Blue at the end of each instalment. 10. There's some stuff in the series that even Sir David Actual Attenborough didn't know about. \"When we first showed him some clips, he was like, 'Oh I didn't know this' and 'I didn't know that',\" James says. \"Genuinely he was surprised. It's always good if you can surprise David, it doesn't happen often.\" 11. One Walrus has clearly been watching Titanic. At one point in the first episode, a walrus tries to seek refuge from a preying polar bear on a floating iceberg. Problem is, there are already some walruses (walri?) on said berg. Clearly, this walrus watched Titanic, and, like the rest of us, thought there was plenty of room for Kate Winslet to shift over and make room for Leonardo DiCaprio on that piece of wood. Unfortunately, the extra weight of this particular walrus on this particular iceberg causes it to collapse, ruining the party for everybody (there's always one). 12. Bottle-nosed dolphins are super-cute They just look so friendly don't they, you'd definitely go for a drink with one. 13. Dolphins surf, Sir David explains, \"to strengthen friendships, develop social skills, and for the sheer exhilaration of it\". Coincidentally, this is also why humans do karaoke. 14. The show doesn't shy away from the impact of pollution. \"You can't go out there and make a series like this without seeing some really big issues unfolding in front of you,\" says James. \"You can go to the middle of the ocean and find plastics from many different continents coming together. \"The impact that has on the wildlife can be devastating.\" In the show, we hear Sir David comment: \"There are worrying signs that conditions in the oceans that have remained relatively stable for millennia, are changing radically.\" 15. Warning: The first episode includes \"mating\". In case you're planning to watch with your parents. Fortunately, the mating involves this handsome chap. 16. Some shots weren't filmed on location. Earlier this week, The Guardian said some footage had been captured in \"controlled laboratory conditions\". After the report was published, James explained the series was overwhelmingly shot on location, but in a few select instances, such as rock pools in the Coasts episode, labs were used. \"Filming in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife,\" he said. \"It would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab.\" 17. It wasn't originally going to be called Blue Planet II. \"The series was commissioned as Oceans,\" explains Tom. \"It was a very easy commission, instinctively the channel understood it was a brilliant thing to do and it felt like it was the right time to go back to this habitat. \"It was never designed so that we'd have Planet Earth II last year and Blue Planet II this year, so now it looks like it was a brilliant strategy, but it wasn't exactly conceived that way.\" 18. Tusk fish are determined little creatures. There is one tusk fish who travels to the edge of the coral reef every morning, Sir David explains, looking for some breakfast. While most of us would grab some Special K from the cupboard, this guy travels quite some distance in search of a small clam. Using his mouth, he takes it back to his \"kitchen\" - which is essentially a massive rock, against which he starts bashing the clam repeatedly in order to crack it open. \"It's not easy when you have no hands,\" Sir David observes. 19. Not all of the plans for the series came off. \"There were lots of shoots that failed, to put it bluntly,\" says Tom. \"The team set out to capture particular species, and when you watch this, I think James and his team make it look really easy. \"And when I think about the number of variables when it comes to filming in the ocean, I think it's remarkable what they were able to capture.\" 20. In true W1A style, the show has led to more collaborative BBC working. \"Some of the new technologies that were invented specifically for this series are already being deployed by the Natural History Unit on future projects,\" says Tom. James adds: \"There was a sequence on The One Show last week about sturgeon [not Nicola], and they borrowed our probe lens, which is great - we built it, they were able to use it.\" 21. There's going to be a podcast to accompany the series. So make sure you're all caught-up on Serial. 22. So... Planet Earth II. Blue Planet II. What's next? \"We have a big landmark series for next year which is very different to Blue Planet II,\" says Tom. \"It's been announced already, it's called Dynasty, not to be confused with Carringtons and Colbys, so who knows if it will stay that title. \"But the premise of each film is we take one animal family and follow them for a number of years to see the ups and downs of their family lines. \"I'm already viewing episodes of it, and it's incredibly visceral. It feels so different to this.\" There's more. \"One other thing I'm really excited about is a series the NHU have made which is on in January called Animals With Cameras, a really simple proposition. \"We've built bespoke cameras for different species, that the animals wear, so we can see the world from an animal's point of view. \"There's meerkats in it,\" he adds. \"That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats.\" Blue Planet II begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Sunday. The series has been sold to more than 30 countries around the world. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "text": "Rajput was found dead in his flat in Mumbai on 14 June. Police said he had killed himself. Since then, unverified details about his career, financial status and even mental health have dominated headlines. It has led to a tussle over who has jurisdiction to investigate - police in Mumbai or his home state Bihar. A single judge bench of the Supreme Court said that the Bihar government was competent to request the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). It has also asked the Mumbai police to hand over all evidence collected so far to the investigating agency. His family, who have filed a case of abetment to suicide against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, have also been asking for the case to be transferred away from Mumbai. On social media, she has been called a \"gold digger\" who \"took away Sushant's money\". She has denied any wrongdoing and issued a plea to Home Minister Amit Shah for a fair investigation into Sushant's death. She had also moved the court asking that the case be heard in Mumbai. She has since been questioned by various investigative agencies. Who was Sushant Singh Rajput? Sushant Singh Rajput lived an extraordinary life - just like some of the characters he played in his hit Bollywood films. He grew up in Bihar, one of India's poorest states. He worked hard and was admitted to one of India's top engineering colleges - a sure way of securing a bright future for middle class families. But his heart was set on acting. So he dropped out of college and went to Mumbai - the home of Bollywood, India's Hindi film industry. He did small roles, took up odd jobs and worked in theatre for years until one of his TV shows became a hit. Success on the big screen followed soon. His story fired the ambitions of young people in small towns - it's why many of his fans took his death as a personal loss. Why has his death been so controversial? With heartbroken fans looking for answers over why he may have taken such a drastic step, unverified details about Sushant's career, financial status, relationships and even mental health started circulating on social media and in debates on news channels. No-one has been spared by the voyeuristic coverage - his therapist, his former cook, his friends, his manager, his family, his colleagues have all been hounded for interviews and exclusives. With police drip-feeding details to the media, the mystery around his death has only deepened. Days after he died, some social media users claimed that he killed himself because a few powerful Bollywood families and directors had treated him unfairly. They said he was an outsider who had no \"godfather\" in the industry, and that his rise was unacceptable to certain Bollywood dynasties. They pointed to recent reports of him being side-lined after he was promised roles in big-budget films. The Mumbai police has been investigating what led to the actor's death. They have interviewed more than 50 people from the film industry to find out if there is enough evidence to file abetment of suicide charges. The officers are yet to file a final report. The allegations led to a severe backlash on social media against some directors and producers. While this debate raged, some channels turned their focus on Rhea Chakraborty, Sushant's actress girlfriend.

    "text": "Kathryn Mayorga, 34, had alleged that the Juventus player raped her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. She reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with the Portuguese star in 2010, but sought to reopen the case in 2018. He denied the allegations. In a statement on Monday, Las Vegas prosecutors said the claims could not \"be proven beyond reasonable doubt\". The Clark County District Attorney's office said the victim reported an assault in 2009, but refused to state where it had happened or who the attacker was. As a result police were unable \"to conduct any meaningful investigation\". In August 2018, Las Vegas police investigated the alleged crime again at the request of the victim. But the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, no charges will be forthcoming.\" German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, first published a story about the allegation last year. It said that in 2010, she reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Ms Mayorga's lawyer said she had been inspired to re-open the case by the #MeToo movement. Ronaldo has not denied that the two met in Las Vegas in 2009, but said that what happened between them was consensual. At the time, Ronaldo was playing for Manchester United, and about to join Real Madrid, where he spent the next nine years. Ronaldo moved to Juventus last July. He has won the Ballon d'Or - awarded to the world's best footballer - in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.",

    "text": "By Matthew Caruana GaliziaWorld Press Freedom Day My mother had published a satirical blog post about a candidate for Maltese prime minister on election day and one of his supporters filed a police report. So, the detective was sent to our family home in the middle of the night with a signed warrant to arrest her for the crime of what can only be called illegal expression. I was working on the other side of the world and people were sending me videos of her being released from the police station at 01:30, wearing my father's shirt. A few hours later, she was back online and writing about this abuse on her website, in-between mocking the new prime minister's insecurities and poking fun at her own appearance. \"I apologise for being in total disarray but when the homicide squad turns up at your home to arrest you at night… brushing your hair, bringing out the powder and blusher and sorting out some fetching clothes are the last thing on your mind,\" she wrote. Now, the same detective who arrested my mother that night finds himself in charge of the investigation into her murder. On the day she was killed my mother, Daphne Caruana Galizia, drove to the bank to regain control of her account, which had been frozen at the request of a government minister. She had just turned 53 and was at the peak of her 30-year career as a journalist. Half a kilo (1lb) of TNT packed into a device under her car seat was remotely detonated. Supporters of the government openly celebrated the assassination, reminding me of those who celebrated the shooting of Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink. Others insinuated that I had planned the murder myself, or that my mother had happily risked her life - the same slander that was repeated about James Foley, the US correspondent who was abducted and beheaded in Syria. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Why do these murders matter so much? \"The free flow of facts and opinions, the stock and trade of journalists, creates societies that are fairer and freer,\" my brother told a gathering of European diplomats, while we were still reeling from our loss. \"It creates societies that are richer and more resilient: in other words, societies that are worth living in.\" After our mother's murder, our only light was the outpouring of support, remorse, sadness and regret coming from all kinds of people. It surprised me and brought to mind something that a friend once told me: \"Good people are everywhere; you have to find them.\" The desire to live in a society that's free and open, where the law is the same for everyone and human rights are respected, is universal. But as with most desires it blows hot and cold. It's often too late when we realise that a few bad people, who, like human disease, will always be with us, have taken over. The task that my brothers, my father and I have set out for ourselves since our mother's murder is enormous: justice for her murder, justice for her investigations and making sure that nothing like this happens again. There is now little time for anything else. Within my family, we sometimes talk to each other about how little patience we have for the inaction and indifference of others, especially those in positions of authority. We find it difficult not to attack their cynicism and their laziness. The children of Turkish investigative journalist Ugur Mumcu told me that after their father was murdered with a car bomb, the chief of police excused their failure to investigate by saying: \"We cannot do anything, there's a brick wall in front of us.\" Their mother's reply to this was: \"So remove one brick, then another, until you take the whole wall down.\" That is what we have been doing ever since our mother was murdered. My guiding principle at the beginning was to do our best come what may. I now think that the process is almost as important as our goals. We're forcing cultural change and generating more respect for free expression by the simple act of making the state do its duty and deliver justice. We've joined others who are eradicating the disease of \"unfreedom\" and teaching the world a new respect for human rights in the process. \"Freedom starts with freedom of conscience,\" the writer Yameen Rasheed told us five days before he was stabbed to death outside his home in the Maldives in 2017. \"Without that fundamental freedom of the mind, what would you do with the other freedoms?\" Like my mother's, his murder showed that there was no respect for those freedoms in our countries. It's not just up to us, the ones left behind, to take up that fight for freedom: the family members, girlfriends, boyfriends and friends of murdered and imprisoned journalists. This great responsibility has landed on our shoulders but we cannot carry it alone. We need good people everywhere to join us. World Press Freedom Day I know there are more of us. Remember that Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi was loved by people everywhere. It was only one person who hated him enough to have the writer killed. In all of these murders, including my mother's, there is little or no sign that the state is making a meaningful effort to convict the people who are ultimately responsible. So, we've started by removing the first brick: demanding Malta launches a public inquiry to find out for itself where it went wrong in preventing the murder of its most important journalist. Then, we'll move on to the next brick. Every day, I wish my mother never had to make this sacrifice on behalf of her country and I would much rather she were still alive. But like Khadija Ismailova, an Azeri journalist whose imprisonment was described as \"outrageous\" by human rights groups, said: \"If we really love, we want our loved ones to be who they are. And this is who Daphne was - fighter and hero.\" What my mother will never know is that her death inspired thousands of acts of heroism, in Malta and beyond. And I like to think that each one of these acts has, in one way or another, protected other brave journalists from my mother's fate.

    "text": "Disclosures by leaker Edward Snowden allege the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's GCHQ successfully decoded key online security protocols. They suggest some internet companies provided the agencies backdoor access to their security systems. The NSA is said to spend $250m (£160m) a year on the top-secret operation. It is codenamed Bullrun, an American civil-war battle, according to the documents published by the Guardian in conjunction with the New York Times and ProPublica. The British counterpart scheme run by GCHQ is called Edgehill, after the first major engagement of the English civil war, say the documents. 'Behind-the-scenes persuasion' The reports say the UK and US intelligence agencies are focusing on the encryption used in 4G smartphones, email, online shopping and remote business communication networks. The encryption techniques are used by internet services such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo. Under Bullrun, it is said that the NSA has built powerful supercomputers to try to crack the technology that scrambles and encrypts personal information when internet users log on to access various services. The NSA also collaborated with unnamed technology companies to build so-called back doors into their software - something that would give the government access to information before it is encrypted and sent over the internet, it is reported. As well as supercomputers, methods used include \"technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications\", the New York Times reports. The US reportedly began investing billions of dollars in the operation in 2000 after its initial efforts to install a \"back door\" in all encryption systems were thwarted. 'Gobsmacked' During the next decade, it is said the NSA employed code-breaking computers and began collaborating with technology companies at home and abroad to build entry points into their products. The documents provided to the Guardian by Mr Snowden do not specify which companies participated. The NSA also hacked into computers to capture messages prior to encryption, and used broad influence to introduce weaknesses into encryption standards followed by software developers the world over, the New York Times reports. When British analysts were first told of the extent of the scheme they were \"gobsmacked\", according to one memo among more than 50,000 documents shared by the Guardian. NSA officials continue to defend the agency's actions, claiming it will put the US at considerable risk if messages from terrorists and spies cannot be deciphered. But some experts argue that such efforts could actually undermine national security, noting that any back doors inserted into encryption programs can be exploited by those outside the government. It is the latest in a series of intelligence leaks by Mr Snowden, a former NSA contractor, who began providing caches of sensitive government documents to media outlets three months ago. In June, the 30-year-old fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked at a small NSA installation, to Hong Kong, and subsequently to Russia after making revelations about a secret US data-gathering programme. A US federal court has since filed espionage charges against Mr Snowden and is seeking his extradition. Mr Snowden, however, remains in Russia where he has been granted temporary asylum.",

    "text": "By Joshua NevettBBC News These are the impressive firsts that could soon be attributable to 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. In January, the physician assistant was picked to join the crew of the world's first all-civilian space mission. Ms Arceneaux was ecstatic but, at first, she had to keep her lips sealed. \"I've held onto the biggest secret of my life for a month and a half. So now I get to share it with the world,\" she told the BBC. Her selection for the historic mission was announced on Monday by the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where Ms Arceneaux was once a cancer patient as a child and now works. Later this year, she will launch from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX, the company founded by business mogul Elon Musk. \"I think this mission is going to inspire people in so many ways,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"It shows them that anything is possible.\" There will be no professional astronauts on board the spacecraft. Rather, Ms Arceneaux will be joined by two contest winners and flight commander Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who is paying for the entire mission. The mission is the pet project of Mr Isaacman, who announced on 1 February that he had bought the rocket launch. Mr Isaacman is aiming to use the flight to raise $200m (£142m) for St Jude, half of which he said he will donate himself. Of the four available seats on the spacecraft, one was offered to a member of staff at the hospital. \"From the start, we wanted a crew member that represented the mission's spirit of hope,\" Mr Isaacman said. \"I can't think of a better person than Hayley to fulfil that responsibility.\" For Ms Arceneaux, the flight will be the realisation of a feat she never thought was possible. At the age of 10, Ms Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at St Jude. As part of her treatment at the hospital, Ms Arceneaux had chemotherapy and surgery to replace some of her leg bones with artificial ones. In a different era, Ms Arceneaux's prosthetic leg bones would have grounded her ambitions for space travel as a Nasa astronaut, because of the agency's strict medical requirements. But the emergence of private space missions in recent years has enabled more of us to reach for the stars. \"Until this mission, I could have never been an astronaut,\" Ms Arceneaux said. \"This mission is opening space travel to people who are not physically perfect.\" Ms Arceneaux was at home in Tennessee when she got the \"out of the blue\" call on 5 January asking if she would join the mission. Her response? \"Immediately, I said, 'yes, yes please'.\" After checking with her family to \"make sure they were not adamantly opposed\", and her brother and sister-in-law who - as aerospace engineers - \"really reassured me how safe space travel is\", she agreed to join the crew. Mr Isaacman is planning to select and reveal the remaining two crew members by March. One will be the winner of a sweepstake competition, whose proceeds will be donated to St Jude. The other will go to the winner of a contest which asks entrepreneurs to design an online store using software made by Shift4, Mr Isaacman's payment technology company. Once selected, the crew will undergo a rigorous, months-long training programme, including mission simulations in zero gravity. Ms Arceneaux - the flight's medical officer - has already tried on her space suit. It was \"so cool\" but \"heavier than I expected\", she said. She will presumably get used to it by the time the rocket lifts off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, sometime at the latter end of 2021. Then, Ms Arceneaux will be wearing the suit for several days as her spacecraft - a SpaceX Dragon capsule - circles the globe. At the end of the mission, the Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft-water landing off the east coast of the US. Are Ms Arceneaux's nerves jangling? \"I'm really not nervous. I've met the lead engineers for every aspect of this mission. I really trust them.\" Compared to what she went through as a child, space travel should be no problem. \"Getting to represent cancer patients and survivors is an incredible honour. It really wasn't that long ago that I was in their shoes,\" she said. \"When you're going through cancer treatment, you're so focused on the day-to-day. It can be really difficult to look toward the future. I hope that this mission will allow them to imagine their future.\" More on space missions:",

According to NetMarket Share, the IE versions account for more than 50% of global browser market. Microsoft says it is investigating the flaw and will take \"appropriate\" steps. The firm, which issued a security advisory over the weekend, said the steps \"may include providing a solution through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs\". The US government advised computer users to consider using alternative web browsers until a security fix is released. XP impact However, the issue may be of special concern to people still using the Windows XP operating system. That is because Microsoft ended official support for that system earlier this month. It means there will be no more official security updates and bug fixes for XP from the firm. Cyber security firm Symantec said it had carried out tests which confirmed that \"the vulnerability crashes Internet Explorer on Windows XP\". \"This will be the first zero day vulnerability that will not be patched for Windows XP users,\" it added. About 30% of all desktops are thought to be still running Windows XP and analysts have previously warned that those users would be vulnerable to attacks from cyber-thieves. Microsoft has suggested businesses and consumers still using the system should upgrade to a newer alternative. 'Complete control' Microsoft said that hackers looking to exploit the flaw could host a \"specially crafted website\" containing content that can help them do so. However, they would still need to convince users to view the website for them to be able to gain access to their computer. They could do this by getting them to click on a link sent via an email or instant messenger, or by opening an attachment sent through an email. However, a hacker would have \"no way to force users\" to view the content. If successful, a hacker could gain the same rights as the computer's current user. \"If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system,\" the firm warned. \"An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" But the firm added that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode, which \"mitigates this vulnerability\".",

    "text": "By Roland Hughes & Chaiyot YongcharoenchaiBBC News The Saudi prince and his wife were away on holiday for three months, and the thief knew this was the time to strike. Kriangkrai Techamong was running a significant risk. Stealing could be punished with amputation in Saudi Arabia, but Kriangkrai's was no ordinary theft - he had his eye on dozens of precious gems and jewels owned by his employer Prince Faisal, the eldest son of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. As a cleaner, Kriangkrai had come to know every corner of Prince Faisal's palace. And he had learned that three of the four safes containing the prince's jewels were regularly left unlocked. It was too good an opportunity to miss: he was struggling with gambling debt he had built up on the site where the palace workers lived, and this was a golden chance to flee the repressive country where he could no longer bear to live. One evening, he made up an excuse to be inside the palace after dark. He waited until other staff had left, and sneaked into the prince's bedroom. He picked some jewels and stuck them to his body using duct tape. He also stored gems inside cleaning equipment, including vacuum bags. By the end, he had taken almost 30kg (66lbs) of loot, valued at close to $20m. Among the pilfered items, Saudi officials would later say, were gold watches and several plump rubies. That night, Kriangkrai hid the valuables all over the palace, in places he knew they would not be discovered. And then, over a month, he moved them and hid them in the middle of a large cargo delivery he was sending home to Thailand. By the time the theft was discovered, Kriangkrai had already fled to his native Thailand, with his cargo leaving a few days before him. But the thief faced another challenge: how to get the stolen goods through Thai customs. All items imported from abroad had to be checked as they entered the country. But because he knew Thai officials could not resist a bribe, Kriangkrai stuffed an envelope with money and a note and put it in his cargo. The note said his cargo had pornographic material inside, and he would prefer it not to be searched. His plan worked, but Kriangkrai could evade justice for only so long. In January 1990, he was arrested at his home in Thailand's northern Lampang province after the Thai police were alerted by their Saudi counterparts. The gems and jewels - some of which he had kept, some of which he had sold - were retrieved soon afterwards. But some time in between their retrieval and their return to Riyadh, another crime occurred. Saudi officials said about 80% were missing, and many of those that had been returned were fake. Then, photographs started circulating of the wife of one senior Thai official wearing a necklace with an uncanny resemblance to one of the missing items. It was the disappearance of one piece in particular that caused consternation, however: a rare 50-carat blue diamond the size of an egg. Only about 1 in 10,000 diamonds has a distinct body colour, says Alan Hart, the CEO of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. Of those, just a tiny minority are blue, ensuring they are among the rarest and most valuable in the world. Their distinct colour comes from the faint traces of boron inside, an element present when the diamond was formed up to 600km (370 miles) below the Earth's surface. Many of the blue diamonds in circulation today come from one source - the Cullinan mine near Pretoria in South Africa - but the origin story of the Saudi blue diamond is unclear and no known photographs of it exist. The case might have ended with Kriangkrai jailed for under three years and Saudi Arabia decrying the disappearance of the prince's jewels, and the blue diamond in particular. Instead, the investigation took a bloody turn. In early February 1990, two officials from the visa section of the Saudi embassy in Bangkok were driving towards the compound in the Thai capital. About a half a mile from their destination, their car was attacked by gunmen and both men were killed. At about the same time, another gunman entered the apartment of one of the men's colleagues and shot him dead. Weeks afterwards, a Saudi businessman, Mohammad al-Ruwaili, was despatched to Bangkok to investigate what might have happened to the missing hoard. But he too was targeted - he was kidnapped and, while his body has never been found, he is widely believed to have been murdered. Plenty of theories about the killings exist. According to a diplomatic note written in 2010 by the deputy chief of mission in the US embassy in Bangkok, and later released by Wikileaks, the killings of the three diplomats \"almost certainly were part of a Saudi feud with Hezbollah\", the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group. But one Saudi official in particular was clear about who was responsible. Mohammed Said Khoja, a Saudi diplomat of 35 years' experience, was sent to Bangkok soon after the theft to oversee the investigation. After expecting to be in Thailand for only three months, he ended up staying for several years. His role was technically not that of an ambassador, but of the lesser charge d'affaires. This was because Saudi Arabia had downgraded its relations with Thailand after the theft and murders, a move that saw the number of Thai workers in Saudi Arabia drop from more than 200,000 to only 15,000. This reportedly cost the Thai economy - so dependent on relatives sending money home - billions of dollars a year. Relations between the two countries are barely any better today. Khoja, a stern moustachioed man, would give press interviews with his Smith & Wesson gun on the desk next to him, insisting that the Thai police were out to get him. His interviews, which would feature on the front pages of Thai newspapers, were unusually candid for a diplomat. He would openly accuse the Thai police of stealing the recovered haul, and of killing the Saudi diplomats and businessman to cover up their own embezzlement. The men were killed, he said, because they had uncovered sensitive information about the theft. The police officer in charge of the investigation into the diplomats' killings was charged with Mohammad al-Ruwaili's disappearance, but the charges were later dropped. \"The police here are bigger than the government itself,\" Khoja told the New York Times in September 1994. \"I am a Muslim, and I stay because I feel I am fighting the devils.\" Read the best of our true-crime coverage This interview was one of many he gave in the same month, and it came soon after another killing linked to the theft. Under growing pressure from Saudi Arabia, Thailand was looking for a resolution to the case. It had identified the man thought to have handled the hoard of gems and jewels after Kriangkrai returned to Thailand. The Thai gem dealer was believed to have sold the goods and replaced them with fakes, and he ended up becoming the key witness in the case. But in July 1994, his wife and son disappeared and their bodies were later found in a Mercedes outside Bangkok. While there were signs of blunt force trauma on their corpses, a forensic report said they had died after their car was hit by a large truck. Khoja gave another round of interviews. \"The forensic commander thinks we're stupid,\" he said in a press conference. \"This was not an accident. They want to cover it up.\" Khoja was right. It would later emerge that police tasked with finding the missing jewels had instead embezzled some of it, extorted the gem dealer, and murdered his wife and son. The police chief in charge of the original investigation, Chalor Kerdthes, ended up serving 20 years in prison. Kriangkrai is nervous. It is 28 years since he was released from prison, 30 years since his daring theft, and now he is back living in north-west Thailand. Over several days, a team from the BBC's Thai service has been following one tip after another as to his whereabouts, and has finally traced him down to his modest home. As his eyes dart from right to left, his paranoia is obvious. He repeatedly asks if our reporter is a police officer and then says we should step outside his home and speak instead in the middle of the rice paddy he keeps nearby. As he forms a path through the knee-high plants, he starts to talk. \"What happened was like a nightmare to me,\" he says. Over the following days, he gives one of his first detailed interviews since that theft, an act that led to the death of at least three people, and possibly many more. Even after all this time, he is still afraid he too could be killed for what he did. It's a feeling that has remained with him from the moment he was caught. \"At that time after I was arrested, I felt like I was out of my mind,\" he says. \"I was panicking and paranoid all the time because of everything around me. The only thing on my mind was that I wouldn't make it out alive. I also thought there were many people who wanted to make me disappear or to kill me. I couldn't sleep at all for a week.\" Kriangkrai insists he had no idea the crime he committed would turn out to be as significant as it did. He knew the gold was worth a lot of money, he says, but didn't appreciate the full value of the other items until after he had left prison. \"When the police found me,\" he says, \"I chose not to fight. I surrendered. I also returned the jewels and helped get back the items I sold. But if it wasn't for the involvement of powerful people in Thailand, this story wouldn't be so big.\" As soon as he left prison - a five-year sentence reduced to only two years and seven months after he pleaded guilty - Kriangkrai changed his surname, to avoid bringing embarrassment to his son. But he continued to feel guilty for what he did, and said his life after prison was full of \"disappointment and unfortunate events\". And so, in March 2016, he decided to become ordained as a Buddhist monk. Kriangkrai invited the media to his ordination ceremony, and said only a few words. \"I want to be ordained for life to erase the curse of the Saudi diamond,\" he said, \"and to dedicate my merit to the people ensnared by my karma, and those who died in all these past events. I want everyone's forgiveness for what I've done.\" Kriangkrai chose a name for himself as a monk that translated as \"he who is as strong as a diamond\". Among those present that day was Chalor Kerdthes, the police chief who had been jailed for his role in the killings of the gem dealer's family. While in prison, Thai media reported, he had continued to state he was not guilty, and had developed a skill as an Elvis impersonator. After his release, he too had decided to become a monk, but his time in the monastery did not last long. Chalor Kerdthes and Kriangkrai are the only people to have been jailed over the Blue Diamond Affair, as it is now known. In March, Thailand's Supreme Court cleared five former police officers over the disappearance and killing of the Saudi businessman, Mohammad al-Ruwaili. While in the monastery, Kriangkrai still could not shake his past. People would seek him out and ask where he had hidden the blue diamond. He would tell them nothing, which led them to believe he had hidden it at home. The blue diamond has never been found. Kriangkrai stayed in the monastery for only three years. \"I couldn't be a monk for life since I still have my family that needs me,\" he says. Now aged 61, he takes whatever work he can find to survive - farming, tending rice paddies, maintenance. \"Now I live a simple life as a country man,\" Kriangkrai says inside his wooden home. \"I don't have much money. It's only enough to survive and feed my family. I guess that for me is true happiness.\"",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Dr Singh, who is widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reforms programme, and is now a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party, spoke to BBC this week in an email exchange. The coronavirus pandemic ruled out a face-to-face interview and Dr Singh declined a video call. During our exchange, he laid out three steps he believes the government has to take to stem the crisis and restore economic normalcy in the coming years. First, the government should \"ensure people's livelihoods are protected and they have spending power through a significant direct cash assistance\". Second, it should make adequate capital available for businesses through \"government-backed credit guarantee programmes\". Third, it should fix the financial sector through \"institutional autonomy and processes\". India's economy was already in the throes of a slowdown before the beginning of the pandemic - GDP grew at 4.2% in the 2019-20, its slowest pace in nearly a decade. The country is now gradually unlocking its economy after a prolonged and grinding shutdown, but the future looks uncertain as infection numbers rise. On Thursday, India became the third country to pass two million Covid-19 cases. Economists have since warned that India's GDP for the 2020-21 financial year is likely to contract sharply, leading to the worst technical recession since the 1970s. \"I do not want to use words like 'depression' in a cavalier fashion,\" Dr Singh said, but a \"deep and prolonged economic slowdown\" was \"inevitable\". \"This economic slowdown is caused by a humanitarian crisis. It is important to view this from the prism of sentiments in our society than mere economic numbers and methods,\" he said. Dr Singh pointed to a consensus forming among economists over an economic contraction in India in nominal terms, \"which if it happens, will be the first time in independent India\". \"I hope the consensus is wrong,\" he said. India locked down early, at the end of March, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many believe the lockdown was hastily executed and did not anticipate the exodus of millions of out-of-work migrant workers from cities. Dr Singh believes India did what other nations were doing, and \"perhaps a lockdown at that stage was an inevitable choice\". \"But the government's shock and awe approach to the lockdown has caused tremendous pain to people. The suddenness of the announcement and the stringency of the lockdown were thoughtless and insensitive,\" he said. \"Public health emergencies such as this are best dealt with locally by local administrators and public health officials, with broad guidelines from the Centre. Perhaps, we should have devolved the Covid-19 battle to the state and local administrations much sooner.\" As finance minister, 29 years ago, Dr Singh helmed an ambitious economic reform programme in 1991 after a balance of payments crisis nearly plunged India into bankruptcy. The 1991 crisis was a domestic crisis induced by global factors, he said. \"But today's economic situation is unprecedented in its ubiquity, scale and depth.\" Not even during World War Two had the \"whole world shut down in such a synchronised fashion as it is now\", he said. In April Narendra Modi's BJP-led government announced a $266bn (£212bn) stimulus, including a range of liquidity measures and reforms to kickstart the economy. India's central bank also introduced rate cuts and moratoriums on loans. With tax receipts plummeting, economists have debated about how a cash-strapped government would be able to get the money to fund direct transfers and provide more capital to ailing banks and credit to businesses. The answer, said Dr Singh was borrowing. \"Higher borrowing is inevitable,\" he said. \"Even if we have to spend an additional 10% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to cater to the military, health and economic challenges, it must be done. He acknowledged that it would increase India's debt to GDP ratio, but if borrowing \"can save lives, borders, restore livelihoods and boost economic growth, then its worth it\", he said. \"We must not be shy of borrowing but we must be prudent on how we use that borrowing,\" he said. In the past, taking loans from multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank have been taken as signs of India's economic weaknesses. But now India could \"borrow from a position of strength, compared to other developing nations,\" Dr Singh said. \"India's track record as a borrower from multilateral institutions is impeccable, It is not a sign of weakness to borrow from these institutions.\" Many countries have decided to print money to fund government spending to tide over the ongoing economic crises, and some prominent economists have suggested the same for India. Others have raised fears about excess supply of money leading to inflation. Monetisation of the fiscal deficit directly by India's central bank used to be norm until the mid 1990s. India, Dr Singh said, had moved away from the practice to bring about \"fiscal discipline, institutional separation from the Reserve Bank of India [central bank] and the government and to curb unhealthy impulses of seemingly free money\". \"I am aware that the traditional fear of high inflation due to excess money supply is perhaps no longer valid in developed nations,\" he said. \"But for countries such as India, other than costs of institutional autonomy of the central bank, unbridled printing of money can have attendant impacts on currency, trade and imported inflation.\" Dr Singh said he was not ruling out printing money to finance the deficit, but \"merely suggesting that let the barrier for that to be very high and use it as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted\". He warned against India following some other nations in becoming more protectionist - imposing high trade barriers duties on imports. India's trade policy over the last three decades had brought \"enormous economic gains to not just the top but across all sections of our population\", he said. As Asia's third largest economy, India today is in a far stronger position today than in the early 1990s. I asked Dr Singh whether these strengths would help India stage a robust recovery after the pandemic ends. \"India's real GDP is 10 times stronger than what it was in 1990, and India had lifted more than 300 million people from poverty since then,\" he said. \"So yes, the Indian economy is intrinsically much stronger now.\" But a significant driver of that growth was India's trade with the rest of the world. The share of global trade in India's GDP increased nearly fivefold in this period. \"India is much more integrated with the rest of the world now,\" Dr Singh said. \"Hence, what happens in the global economy will have a significant impact on India's economy. In this pandemic, the global economy is severely dented and that will be a big cause of concern for India.\" Ultimately, no one yet knows the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, nor how long nations will take to recover from it. But one thing is clear, it has defied the experience of even seasoned economists like Dr Singh. \"The previous crises were macroeconomic crises for which there were proven economic tools,\" he said. \"Now we have an economic crisis caused by an epidemic which has induced fear and uncertainty in society, and monetary policy as an economic tool to counter this crisis is proving to be blunt.\"",

    "text": "The research found that facts were less important to some than the emotional desire to bolster national identity. Social media analysis suggested that right-wing networks are much more organised than on the left, pushing nationalistic fake stories further. There was also an overlap of fake news sources on Twitter and support networks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The findings come from extensive research in India, Kenya, and Nigeria into the way ordinary citizens engage with and spread fake news. Participants gave the BBC extensive access to their phones over a seven-day period, allowing the researchers to examine the kinds of material they shared, whom they shared it with and how often. The research, commissioned by the BBC World Service and published today, forms part of \"Beyond Fake News\" - a series across TV, radio and digital that aims to investigate how disinformation and fake news are affecting people around the world. In all three countries, distrust of mainstream news outlets pushed people to spread information from alternative sources, without attempting to verify it, in the belief that they were helping to spread the real story. People were also overly confident in their ability to spot fake news. The sheer flood of digital information being spread in 2018 is worsening the problem. Participants in the BBC research made little attempt to query the original source of fake news messages, looking instead to alternative signs that the information was reliable. These included the number of comments on a Facebook post, the kinds of images on the posts, or the sender, with people assuming WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without checking. Widespread sharing of false rumours on WhatsApp has led to a wave of violence in India, with people forwarding on fake messages about child abductors to friends and family out of a sense of duty to protect loved ones and communities. According to a separate BBC analysis, at least 31 people have been killed in the last two years, and 24 people in the past year alone, in incidents involving rumours spread on social media or messaging apps. We examined one case in detail - the deaths of Nilotpal and Abhishek in Assam - while another reporter travelled to Mexico to see how WhatsApp rumours fuelled similar deadly violence there. The research in Africa suggested that national identity was insignificant in the spread of fake news. In Kenya, scams related to money and technology were a stronger driving force, contributing to around a third of stories shared on WhatsApp, while fake stories relating to terrorism and the army were widely shared in Nigeria. In both countries, health scares were prominent among widely shared fake news stories, and many news consumers visited both credible and fake news sources without distinguishing between them. Researchers spent hundreds of hours with 80 participants across the three countries, interviewing them at home about their media consumption as well as examining how they shared information via WhatsApp and Facebook during a seven-day period. They also conducted extensive analysis of how fake news spreads on Twitter and Facebook in India, to understand whether the spread of fake news was politically polarised. About 16,000 Twitter accounts and 3,000 Facebook pages were analysed. The results showed a strong and coherent promotion of right-wing messages, while left-wing fake news networks were loosely organised, if at all, and less effective. The methodology By Santanu Chakrabarti We set out with this research to try to answer the question of why ordinary citizens spread fake news - a little-understood part of the fake news equation. When a phenomenon is new or not very well understood, qualitative research techniques are useful. These techniques - in this case, in-depth interviews and up-close observation of sharing behaviours - allowed us to explore fake news with nuance, richness and depth. Because we wanted to know what was spreading in encrypted private networks such as WhatsApp, ethnographic approaches - visiting people at home - were essential. This is the first known research project in these countries that uses these methods to understand the fake news phenomenon at the level of ordinary citizens. It is also the first to use data science and network analysis techniques to understand how known sources of fake news are organised on Twitter and Facebook, and what their connections are with audiences. This story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.

    "text": "Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995 \"for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past\". Over his long career he was awarded numerous prizes and received many honours for his work. He recently suffered from ill health. His 2010 poetry collection The Human Chain was written after he suffered a stroke and the central poem, Miracle, was directly inspired by his illness. Recalling how he had been lifted up and down the stairs to his bedroom, the poet eulogised the biblical characters who carried a paralysed man to Jesus to be healed. \"Their shoulders numb, the ache and stoop deeplocked / In their backs, the stretcher handles / Slippery with sweat. And no let up.\" 'Profound sorrow' \"The death has taken place of Seamus Heaney,\" said a short statement issued by his family on Friday. \"The poet and Nobel laureate died in hospital in Dublin this morning after a short illness. The family has requested privacy at this time.\" Heaney's publisher, Faber, said: \"We cannot adequately express our profound sorrow at the loss of one of the world's greatest writers. His impact on literary culture is immeasurable. \"As his publisher we could not have been prouder to publish his work over nearly 50 years. He was nothing short of an inspiration to the company, and his friendship over many years is a great loss.\" Andrew Motion, former Poet Laureate and a friend of Heaney, told The Telegraph that Heaney was \"a great poet, a wonderful writer about poetry, and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence.\" The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish poet Paul Muldoon told BBC Radio 3: \"One of his great gifts was to allow people in who were not necessarily that interested in poetry... and I think that's one of the reasons why he occupies such an extraordinary place in people's hearts.\" Heaney was born in April 1939, the eldest of nine children, on a farm near Toomebridge in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, but as a child moved to the village of Bellaghy. He was educated at St Columb's College, Derry, a Catholic boarding school, and later at Queen's University Belfast, before training as a teacher. He settled in Dublin, with periods of teaching in the US. Heaney was an honorary fellow at Trinity College Dublin and, last year, was bestowed with the Seamus Heaney Professorship in Irish Writing at the university, which he described as a great honour. His first book, Death of a Naturalist, published in 1966, reflected his rural upbringing, but as Ireland's troubles increased his work took a more political turn. In 2011, Heaney donated a collection of his literary papers to the National Library of Ireland. It included manuscripts of his poetry, a comprehensive and vast collection of loose-leaf, typescript and manuscript worksheets and bound notebooks. The collection spanned Heaney's literary career, from the publication of Death of a Naturalist (1966), to volumes such as Wintering Out (1972) and North (1975), right through to Station Island (1984), Seeing Things (1991) and his most recent publications, District and Circle (2006) and Human Chain (2010). The latter won the prestigious £10,000 Forward Prize in 2010. Heaney described the collection, his 12th, as his most personally revealing collection of poems. He had been nominated for the Forward Prize three times before, but this was his first win. Judge and author Ruth Padel described Heaney's volume as \"painful, honest, and delicately weighted\". Over the course of his career, Heaney also won the TS Eliot Prize, and was made Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was also the professor of poetry at Oxford University between 1989 and 1994. In an interview with the Today programme's James Naughtie in early 2013, Heaney remembered how he felt when he first discovered poetry. \"It was the voltage of the language, it was entrancing,\" he said. \"I think the first little jolt I got was reading Gerard Manley Hopkins - I liked other poems... but Hopkins was kind of electric for me - he changed the rules with speech and the whole intensity of the language was there and so on.\" Irish President Michael D Higgins said Heaney's contribution \"to the republics of letters, conscience, and humanity was immense\". Northern Irish poet Michael Longley said: \"I feel like I've lost a brother and there are tens of thousands of people today who will be feeling personally bereaved because he had a great presence. \"Just as his presence filled a room, his marvellous poems filled the hearts of generations of readers.\" Australian author Kathy Lette posted on Twitter: \"RIP Seamus Heaney. I once introduced him to my son as the world's greatest poet. My son frowned. 'No, that would be Bob Dylan.' Seamus roared.\" Queen's University Belfast also paid tribute to its former student, staff member and honorary graduate, calling him a \"true friend of the university\". \"Generous with his scholarship and his time, his warmth, humour and brilliance will be sorely missed,\" professor James McElnay, acting president and vice-chancellor, said. \"His contribution to the world of literature has introduced millions of people around the globe to the enjoyment of poetry and enhanced it for many more.\" Mr Heaney is survived by his wife, Maire, and three children Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann. A funeral mass for the poet will take place on Monday at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, Dublin. This will be followed by interment in Bellaghy.",

    "text": "The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Fearing violence, officials say that no-one will face immediate deportation. They say that a lengthy appeal process will be available to all - even if it means millions of families will live in limbo until they get a final decision on their legal status. Who is affected? Millions of people fled to neighbouring India after Bangladesh declared itself an independent country from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, sparking a bitter war. Many of the refugees settled in Assam. Under the Assam Accord, an agreement signed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, all those who cannot prove that they came to the north-eastern state before 24 March 1971 will be deleted from electoral rolls and expelled as they are not considered legitimate citizens. More than 32 million people submitted documents to the NRC to prove they were citizens, but four million of them have been excluded from the published list. Many Bengalis - a linguistic minority in Assam - are worried they will be deported en masse. Hasitun Nissa, who spoke to the BBC's Joe Miller days before the list was published, said she had never known a home outside the state's floodplains. It is where the 47-year-old schoolteacher spent her childhood, where she studied, where she got married and where she had her four children. She said her family arrived in India before 1971 but she expected to be stripped of her Indian citizenship and feared her land rights, voting rights and freedom would be in peril. Are Bengalis being targeted? Activists say the NRC is now being used as a pretext for a two-pronged attack - by Hindu nationalists and Assamese hardliners - on the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. Like Hasitun, many Bengalis live in the wetlands dotted along the Bramaputra river, moving around when water levels rise. Their paperwork, if it exists, is often inaccurate. Officials claim illegal Bangladeshis are enmeshed in the Bengali population, often hiding in plain sight with forged papers - and a thorough examination of all documents is the only way to find them. But Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed is adamant that the NRC is serving another agenda entirely. \"It is nothing but a conspiracy to commit atrocities,\" he told the BBC. \"They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar, could happen to us here.\" Such alarming comparisons are dismissed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which emphasises that the NRC is an apolitical task, overseen by the country's secular Supreme Court. What next for the 'stateless'? Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. After human rights organisations began to express concern, the civil servant in charge of the NRC, Prateek Hajela, released a statement stressing that the law required him to make \"no differentiation on the basis of religion or language\" in determining citizenship. But correspondents say the prime minister has never been shy of expressing his preference for Hindu Bangladeshi migrants, whom he says should be embraced by India. Other \"infiltrators\", Mr Modi told a crowd in 2014, would be deported. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is considering a bill that would enshrine the rights of Hindu migrants in law. Indeed, a promotional song posted on Facebook by the NRC itself does little to calm the nerves of those worried about a Hindu nationalist witch hunt. \"A new revolution, to defeat the alien enemy, is beckoning,\" a young woman sings, \"bravely let us shield our motherland.\" Will there definitely be deportations? Siddhartha Bhattacharya, Assam's law minister and a member of the BJP, is in no doubt about the fate of those who have been rejected. \"Everyone will be given a right to prove their citizenship,\" he told the BBC. \"But if they fail to do so, well, the legal system will take its own course.\" That, Mr Bhattacharya clarified, would mean expulsion from India. At present, correspondents say, that seems little more than a threat aimed at whipping up Hindu support for the BJP ahead of elections. No deportation procedures have been put in place, and Bangladesh, already burdened by the Rohingya crisis, has shown no sign of being open to accepting a raft of new refugees. Nonetheless, campaigners like Samujjal Bhattacharyya say something must be done. His organisation, the All Assam Students' Union, has been agitating for the expulsion of illegal Bangladeshis - regardless of their religion - for decades. If deportations don't happen, he says, \"the illegal foreigner will intrude upon the corridor of power. We are not prepared to be second-class citizens\". Hasitun Nissa takes such rhetoric seriously. \"We have never harmed Hindus. We can live peacefully side-by-side,\" she says. \"But I fear bad news will come.\"",

    "text": "By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Whether soft or hard-boiled, fried or whisked into an omelette, eggs appeared to give infants a boost. It could be a cheap way to prevent stunting, say researchers in the journal Pediatrics. The first two years of life are critical for growth and development - any stunting is largely irreversible. Too short for age Poor nutrition is a major cause of stunting, along with childhood infections and illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, 155 million children under the age of five are stunted (too short for their age). Most live in low- and middle-income countries and health experts have been looking at ways to tackle the issue. Lora Iannotti and her colleagues set up a field experiment in the rural highlands of Ecuador and gave very young children (aged six to nine months) free eggs to eat to see if this might help. Egg dinners Only half of the 160 youngsters who took part in the randomised trial were fed an egg a day for six months - the others were monitored for comparison. The researchers visited the children's families every week to make sure they were sticking to the study plan and to check for any problems or side-effects, including egg allergy. Stunting was far less common among the egg treatment group by the end of the study - the prevalence was 47% less than in the non-egg group, even though relatively more of these egg-fed infants were considered short for their age at the start of the study. Some of the children in the control group did eat eggs, but nowhere near as many as the treatment group. Lead researcher Ms Iannotti said: \"We were surprised by just how effective this intervention proved to be. \"And what's great is it's very affordable and accessible for populations that are especially vulnerable to hidden hunger or nutritional deficiency.\" She said eggs were great food for young children with small stomachs. \"Eggs contain a combination of nutrients, which we think is important.\" Balanced diet Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \"In a way, it is surprising that more research has not been conducted using egg in this situation - although I know that in some cultures, parents do not necessarily find egg to be an acceptable early food mainly because of concerns about allergy. \"Egg is a good nutritious complementary food that can be introduced as part of a varied diet once the mother decides to start complementary feeding - never before four months.\" She said eggs should always be well cooked to avoid any potential infection risk. The WHO recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the child's first six months to achieve optimal growth, development and health. After the first six months, infants should be given nutritious complementary foods and continue breastfeeding up to the age of two years or beyond. The British Nutrition Foundation advised: \"While eggs are a nutritious food to include, it's very important that young children have a variety of foods in their diets. Not only is this necessary to get all the vitamins and minerals they need, but also to allow them to become familiar with a wide range of tastes and textures. \"A range of protein-rich foods should be provided when feeding young children, which can include eggs but can also feature beans, pulses, fish, especially oily fish, meat and dairy products.\"",

    "text": "Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 36, will be flown on a chartered plane to Mumbai where bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala plans to operate. The Indian embassy in Cairo initially denied her visa request as she was unable to travel there in person. After the surgeon tweeted to India's foreign minister that changed. India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is herself in hospital awaiting a kidney transplant, was quick to respond with an offer of help. Ms Abd El Aty's family says she hasn't been able to leave home for 25 years now and claims she weighs 500kg. If the claim about her weight is true, then that would make her the world's heaviest woman alive as the current Guinness record holder is Pauline Potter of the United States who weighed 292kg (643lb) in 2010. Dr Lakdawala, who has performed weight reduction surgeries on Indian minister Nitin Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu, told the BBC that from looking at Ms Abd El Aty's medical reports and photographs, he believes that she weighs at least 450kg. Ms Abd El Aty's family says she weighed 5kg (11lb) at birth and was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which a limb or other body parts swell due to a parasitic infection, Dr Lakdawala told the BBC in a phone call from Mumbai. \"They said when she was 11, she had gained immense weight because of which she could not stand up and would crawl. \"And then she suffered a stroke which left her bedridden and she has not been able to leave home since then.\" Ms Abd El Aty is cared for by her mother and sister. Dr Lakdawala said Ms Abd El Aty's sister got in touch with him in October and he began raising money to bring her over to Mumbai as her family was too poor and unable to bear the costs of chartering a flight. \"We are expecting to fly her to Mumbai next week as soon as the formalities are over,\" he said. Dr Lakdawala believes that Ms Abd El Aty does not have elephantiasis, but suffers from obesity-related lymphoedema which causes gigantic swelling of legs. \"She would need to remain in Mumbai for two to three months for the surgery and treatment after which she would be able to return home, but it would take two to three years to bring her body weight under 100kg,\" the surgeon said. \"I'm hopeful that I will be able to help her, I won't say I'm confident because I think that would be an exaggeration,\" he added. What is bariatric surgery? Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat. In the UK, this type of surgery is available on the NHS only to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments have not worked. Around 8,000 people a year in the UK currently receive the treatment. The two most common types of weight loss surgery are: Where are you on the global fat scale?",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The next-generation games machine will become available in North America on 15 November and Europe on 29 November. Its rival Microsoft has only said that the Xbox One will go on sale some time the same month. Experts suggested that the latest revelation might help gain the Japanese firm headlines, but that it would be software that ultimately decided which company came out on top. \"Sony has made fantastic progress as it prepares to release the PS4, but the console still lacks a show-stopping exclusive game,\" said Rob Crossley, associate editor at the Computer and Video Games news site, following the announcement at the Gamescom trade fair in Cologne. \"That will certainly come eventually, but some might argue the most crucial time is now. \"Sony's press conference once again demonstrated the company has an enviably deep and meaningful relationship with the indie developer community... but Sony executives will no doubt be feeling uneasy as the list of major Xbox One exclusive games continues to grow.\" Lewis Ward, a games expert at the consultants IDC, agreed that at this point the launch date was of limited importance. \"If it turns out that the PS4 goes on sale a week before the Xbox One, for example, then clearly Sony will have time to itself to make some hay,\" he said. \"But until we know when Microsoft is going to land I'm not sure what putting the date out there does much beyond making a news story - it won't change people's buying intentions.\" Sony said there had already been more than one million pre-orders of its new console worldwide. It added that a total of 32 countries would be able to buy the PS4 during the Christmas holiday season. Vita price cut Previously unannounced PS4 titles unveiled in Germany included: Sony also announced a price cut to its handheld console, the PlayStation Vita. It said the \"wi-fi only\" version of the device would now cost $199 (£127) excluding tax - a $50 reduction. It also promised cheaper memory cards. Similar cuts are being made in Europe. Retailers in the UK are now listing the model for about £170 including bundled games. The machine's price was reduced earlier in the year in Japan. \"The handheld business has not been performing well, but I think a $50 cut will push up Vita sales significantly,\" said Mr Ward. \"But the real driver over the long term will be must-have games and the choice is still thinner than some consumers would want.\"",

    "text": "It will cost $299.99 in the US, £279.99 in the UK and 29,980 yen ($260) in Japan, more than some analysts and gamers had been expecting. The stakes are high for the Japanese firm after its most recent console, the Wii U, failed to replicate the success of the original Wii. Nintendo shares dipped as details of the launch trickled out. Mario is back Nintendo revealed in October last year that the games machine would be a handheld device that doubles as a home console. Previously code-named NX, the Switch looks like a tablet computer with Joy-Con controllers that attach to its sides. The screen is touch-sensitive and the controllers can detect movement, like the Wii Remote. When used at home, the tablet component slots into a dock that connects to a TV set. Games will be delivered on small cartridges, a nod to older Nintendo consoles. The firm said that about 80 games were in development, including a new Mario game called Super Mario Odyssey, out late in 2017. One of the new titles unveiled was Arms, a motion-controlled boxing game, due to be released this spring. 'Bad price points' Initially, there was some negative reaction online to the pricing of the console's accessories. A Pro Controller, in the style of a traditional console controller, costs $69.99 (£57.50), additional Joy-Con controllers are $79.99 and a spare dock to use the Switch with another TV or monitor is $89.99. \"These are bad, bad price points,\" wrote video game writer Pat Contri on Twitter. The pricing was described as a \"bad, bad joke\" by video game news site Polygon. But some reactions were more positive. \"Fair play Nintendo, this looks wonderful,\" wrote one fan on Twitter. Other details announced on Friday included: Nintendo consoles: A history in pictures 'Watershed moment' Some analysts believe the device could be Nintendo's \"last shot\" at selling a home console, after the Wii U proved a flop. It was rapidly outsold by Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, although Nintendo has enjoyed success with its handheld 3DS device. \"The Switch release is a watershed moment for Nintendo as it puts into practice a strategy to defend its traditional console business by also appealing to those gamers that routinely use tablets and smartphones for gaming,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, gaming analyst at IHS Technology. He added that the price of the main console was \"as predicted\". \"This is not an impulse purchase or as cheap as other recent Nintendo consoles and at this price point Nintendo will be competing with existing consoles and tablets. \"As a result, communicating the unique aspects of the Switch - particularly the capabilities of the Joy-Con controllers - and its exclusive content through marketing spend will be key.\" Mr Harding-Rolls added that he thought the decision to launch a paid online service \"makes complete strategic sense\" and brings it into line with rivals Microsoft and Sony. By releasing something that allowed gamers to play Nintendo titles both at home and on the move, the firm could find a \"very lucrative middle ground\", said Ovum analyst Paul Jackson. \"Pure console gamers are likely to be disappointed here as it will probably be a powerful mobile device (battery allowing) but a comparatively weedy dedicated home one.\"",

The women claim Mr Cosby portrayed them as liars after they went public with their allegations against him. He filed a countersuit alleging their claims were only for financial gain. The 78-year-old is also seeking unspecified monetary damages and said the women inflicted emotional distress. Mrs Cosby is also her husband's business partner and the couple have been married for more than 50 years. Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the women, argued last month he should be able to question Mrs Cosby because he believed she had \"information that's relevant to the litigation in this matter\". 'Shame and embarrassment' As well as throwing out her marital status disqualification attempts, Judge Magistrate David Hennessey also rejected claims the value of her evidence would be undermined by the \"undue burden\" it would cause her. \"The arguments do not outweigh the potential significance of Mrs Cosby's testimony, nor has Mrs Cosby provided any authority that they do,\" he said. The comedian had also tried to prevent his wife having to testify by having his lawyers argue it was an attempt to put pressure on him by causing them both \"shame and embarrassment\". Mr Cosby's accusers' legal claim alleges he and his representatives sought to tarnish their reputations after they went public with their claims of sexual misconduct. Mr Cosby has repeatedly denied the accusations. His counter legal claim contends the women \"engaged in a campaign to assassinate\" his reputation and character. He has, however, admitted in court proceedings he obtained and gave women sedatives over the years, but he maintained the women took the drugs willingly. Last week, prosecutors in Pennsylvania charged the comedian with an alleged sexual assault in 2004. It is the first time Mr Cosby has been charged with any offence after months of accusations by dozens of women. He is currently on $1m (£675,000) bail.",

    "text": "By Mark TullyBBC News, India When the Bollywood actor Amrish Puri played the villainous Mola Ram in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom the director - Steven Spielberg - described him as \"my favourite villain, the best the world has produced and ever will\". In Bollywood, Amrish is best remembered for an over the top, some would say absurd role as Mogambo, a ridiculous, garish, outrageously dressed megalomaniac who aimed to conquer India in a film called Mr India. Amrish's two roles illustrate the anomaly of Bollywood and the reason it is so underestimated. It has produced actors, directors, musicians and technicians described by the renowned film critic Derek Malcolm as having \"every right to be compared with the best of those from Hollywood\", yet its output is so different. And that is because it is aimed at an Indian audience. The larger than life characters they like can all too easily be mistaken for parodies of reality. Yet those characters have consistently reflected the mood of India for 100 years. The first silent Indian films were mythological, and so inevitably larger than life. The myths represented a widespread desire to get rid of the British and restore India to its past glory. In the early days of independence, national pride was high and it was believed that socialism would eradicate poverty. In the classic film of that era, Mother India, there was a melodramatic scene when a village woman trapped in debt was bent double pulling a plough because she had been forced to sell her bullocks. The problem of poverty was highlighted but so was the fortitude of the poor. Sadly, socialism spawned a stifling bureaucracy which wound its tentacles round every sphere of national life, strangling the earlier optimism. Bollywood reflected the despair of this era with the emergence of the angry young man, epitomised by the actor who was to become the greatest Bollywood star of all time, Amitabh Bachchan. India came to a halt when he was seriously injured while filming one of the ferocious fights that were an essential element in those films. The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi never one to miss a chance to identify herself with the national mood, rushed to Amitabh's bedside in a Bombay hospital. To take the nation's mind off the grim reality of the 1970s when the global oil price rise compounded the damage bureaucratic red tape was inflicting on the economy, Bollywood turned to teenage romance. To lend reality to the film called Bobby which started this trend, the director chose a star who was only 16, Dimple Kapadia. Indira Gandhi ordered the government-controlled television to screen Bobby in the hope that it would keep people at home when opposition leaders were holding a massive rally in Delhi demanding her resignation. It did not. For many years India was prudish, so bare bellies, and clinging, wet saris were as far as directors would go. Kissing was taboo. When another teenage star, Mandakani, stood in a waterfall, her sari so transparent that little was left to the imagination, there was a national outcry. In a film just released to celebrate the centenary of Bollywood there is heterosexual and homosexual kissing, reflecting how the mood has changed. In the centenary year India is enraged by scandals revealing rampant corruption, and Bollywood is reflecting this. In one recent film - Jolly LLB - businessmen, a judge, lawyers, and policemen are all corrupt. Fortunately in the end the anti-hero judge becomes a hero, and one of the lawyers is shamed into honesty, so there is a traditional Bollywood happy ending. Purists would probably regard the seedy judge and fast talking lawyer in Jolly LLB as over the top, but for the last 100 years the skilled artists of Bollywood have shown that Indians like larger than life characters to reflect their society. And that does not make them any less real. Gulchan Grover, one of Amrish Puri's fellow villains liked to tell the story about the airline passenger who refused to sit next to him because to her he was as villainous in real life as he was on screen. Changes have come, now that middle-class multiplex cinemas divide the Indian audience. The poor can only afford the traditional one-screen cinemas where they provide a lively audience jeering when the villain comes on, cheering the hero, whistling and making other encouraging noises when there is any chance of a kiss. If the heroine is reluctant to kiss the audience will shout \"give me one\" and when the songs are what are known as item numbers, that is to say raunchy numbers, the audience will join in the dancing. The Bollywood director Shayam Benegal told me he does now paint with a less broad brush keeping the more sophisticated middle-class multiplex audiences in mind. But the colours are still Bollywood bright. How to listen to From Our Own Correspondent: BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00 Listen online or download the podcast.

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Hindu and Muslim couples usually approach Dhanak when their families deny them permission to marry. Aged between 20-30 years, the harried men and women want the group to talk to their families or help them seek legal assistance. Among the couples who come to Dhanak, 52% are Hindu women planning to marry Muslim men; and 42% are Muslim women planning to marry Hindu men \"Both Hindu and Muslim families in India fiercely oppose interfaith marriages,\" Asif Iqbal, founder of Dhanak, told me. \"They will stoop to any level to stop them. Parents even smear the reputation of their daughters to dissuade her lover's family. The so-called 'love-jihad' is another weapon to discourage such relationships.\" The bogey of \"love-jihad\", a term radical Hindu groups use to accuse Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage, has returned to haunt India's interfaith relationships. Last week, police in northern Uttar Pradesh state held a Muslim man for allegedly trying to convert a Hindu woman to Islam - he was the first to be arrested under a new anti-conversion law that targets love-jihad. At least four other states ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are planning similar laws. Party spokespeople say such laws are required to stop \"deception, fraud and misrepresentation\". \"When a Hindu man marries a Muslim woman, it is always portrayed as romance and love by Hindu organisations, while when the reverse happens it is depicted as coercion,\" says Charu Gupta, a historian at University of Delhi, who has researched the \"myth of love jihad\" . Love remains difficult - and dangerous - in large swathes of India where patriarchy, kinship, religion, caste and family honour hold sway. Yet young men and women across the divides are braving centuries of social resistance in villages and small towns. Helped by mobile phones, cheap data and social networking sites, they are meeting and falling in love in greater numbers than ever before. They are breaking what writer Arundhati Roy, in her Booker-prize winning novel The God of Small Things, described as \"love laws\" that \"lay down who should be loved…And how…And how much\". Monogamous, arranged, heterosexual and same-community marriages are idealised - more than 90% of all marriages in India are arranged. Interfaith marriages are rare. One study put them at just over 2%. Many believe the spectre of love jihad is resurrected from time to time by Hindu groups for political gains. That such strident campaigns against interfaith unions have a long and chequered history in India is well-documented. In the backdrop of rising religious tensions in the 1920s and 1930s, Hindu nationalist groups in parts of northern India launched a campaign against \"kidnapping\" of Hindu women by Muslim men and demanded the recovery of their Hindu wives. A Hindu group was set up in United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state) to prevent Muslims from allegedly kidnapping Hindu women. In 1924, a Muslim bureaucrat in the city of Kanpur was accused of \"abducting and seducing\" a Hindu girl and forcefully converting her. A Hindu group demanded the \"recovery\" of the woman from the bureaucrat's house. The abduction of Hindu women was even debated in parliament in colonial India. The Indian National Congress, now the main opposition party, passed a resolution saying that \"women who have been abducted and forcibly married must be restored to their houses; mass conversions have no significance or validity and people must be given every opportunity to return to the life of their choice\". When India was partitioned into two separate states in August 1947, one million died and 15 million were displaced as Muslims fled to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs headed in the opposite direction. Women often bore the brunt of the violence, creating another deep fault-line. In recent times Hindu nationalist groups have raised the bogey of \"love jihad\" ahead of elections to polarise voters. One instance was during local elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2014. Prof Gupta says Hindu groups launched an \"orchestrated propaganda campaign\", using posters, rumours and gossip, against the \"supposed abductions and conversion of Hindu women by Muslim men, ranging from allegations of rape and forced marriage, to elopement, love, luring and conversion\". Mouthpieces of the right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP's ideological fountainhead, carried cover stories on \"love jihad\" and urged people to raise the slogan \"love for ever, love jihad never!\". It was not only the stereotyping of the Muslim male that fed the narrative. There were rumours about a \"global Islamist conspiracy\" to lure Hindu women. It was alleged that Muslim men were receiving funds from abroad to purchase expensive clothes and cars and gifts and even posing as Hindus to woo Hindu women. A BJP spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh said this was \"part of a global love jihad that targets vulnerable Hindu girls\". All this was an \"attempt at political and religious mobilisation in the name of women\", according to Prof Gupta. There are striking similarities between the 'love jihad' campaigns of the past and present, say scholars. But with time, the campaign has been more forceful as it has been led by the ruling BJP. \"Before Independence such campaigns were buried in the inside pages of newspaper. There were no mainstream parties or leaders stoking such tensions. Now it is a front-page subject and the state is critically involved in enforcing these laws. Social media and messaging services are being used to spread the message that Muslim men are forcibly converting Hindu women for marriage,\" says Prof Gupta. Many say conversions happen when couples opt for a religious marriage to \"escape\" India's Special Marriage Act, which allows interfaith marriages only after a month's notice to the authorities containing the couple's personal details. So couples fear that their families will intervene to prevent the wedding. Introducing laws to restrict choices consenting interfaith adults make about their partners now introduces a culture of fear which both parents and authorities can use to warn young people. On the other hand, more and more men and women are also braving caste and religious divides to fall in love and break away from their families. Many are finding shelter in state-run safe-houses at a time when the state itself is trying to clamp down on such unions. \"Love is complex and tough in India,\" says Mr Iqbal.",

    "text": "By Michelle RobertsBBC News The biggest global study into attitudes on immunisation suggests confidence is low in some regions. The Wellcome Trust analysis includes responses from more than 140,000 people in over 140 countries. The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. You need a modern browser (with JavaScript support) to view this interactive. Do people in your country trust vaccines? Search for a country: Search for a country: People were asked how much they agree with the statement. Select a statement to see results Totals may not sum to 100% due to rounding Wellcome analysed responses to five key survey questions and calculated a \"trust in scientists\" index of high, medium or low trust. Source: Wellcome Global Monitor, Gallup World Poll 2018 Sorry, there is no data for this location No internet connection. Please try again. If you can't see the interactive tool click or tap here. The global survey reveals the number of people who say they have little confidence or trust in vaccination. When asked if vaccines were safe: When asked if they believed vaccines worked: Why does it matter? There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against deadly and debilitating infections, such as measles. Vaccines protect billions of people around the world. They have completely got rid of one disease - smallpox - and are bringing the world close to eliminating others, such as polio. But some other diseases, such as measles, are making a resurgence and experts say people avoiding vaccines, fuelled by fear and misinformation, is one of the main causes. Dr Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunisation at the WHO, said the current situation was extremely serious. \"Vaccine hesitancy has the potential, at least in some places, to really hinder the very real progress the world has made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases,\" she said. \"Any resurgence we see in these diseases are an unacceptable step backwards.\" What about measles? Countries that were close to eliminating measles have been seeing large outbreaks. Data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. A decision not to vaccinate, for whatever reason, poses a risk to others as well as the individual from being infected themselves. If enough people are vaccinated, it stops the disease from spreading through a population - something experts call \"herd immunity\". Imran Khan, from the Wellcome Trust, said: \"We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95% coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing.\" Where was trust low? Some people living in several higher-income regions were among the least certain about vaccine safety. In France - a country among several European ones now experiencing outbreaks of measles - one in three disagreed that vaccines were safe, according to the survey. That was the highest percentage for any country worldwide. People in France were also among the most likely to disagree that vaccines were effective, at 19%, and to disagree that vaccines were important for children to have, at 10%. The French government has now added eight more compulsory vaccinations to the three children in the country already receive. Neighbouring Italy - where 76% agreed vaccines were safe - recently passed a law that allows schools to ban unvaccinated children, or fine their parents, after immunisation rates dwindled. The UK has yet to go this far but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he \"won't rule out\" the idea of introducing compulsory vaccinations if necessary. The US has also been experiencing its own measles outbreak - the biggest to hit the country in decades, with more than 980 confirmed cases in 26 states in 2019 to date. In Northern America, and Southern and Northern Europe, just over 70% of people agreed that vaccines were safe. The figure was as low as 59% in Western Europe, and 50% in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, which reported the highest number of measles cases in Europe last year (53,218 in total) - only 50% of people agreed vaccines were effective. This figure was 46% in Belarus, 49% in Moldova, and 62% in Russia. Where was trust high? Most people in lower-income areas agreed vaccines were safe. The highest number was in South Asia, where 95% of people agreed, followed by Eastern Africa, where the figure was 92%. Bangladesh and Rwanda had nearly universal agreement about the safety and effectiveness and have achieved very high immunisation rates despite many challenges in physically getting vaccines to people. Rwanda became the world's first low-income country to provide young women universal access to the HPV vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. Mr Khan said: \"It shows what can be achieved with concerted effort to improve vaccine uptake.\" What makes people sceptical? In the survey, people with more trust in scientists, doctors and nurses tended to be more likely to agree that vaccines were safe. Conversely, those who had sought information about science, medicine or health recently appeared to be less likely to agree. The Wellcome report does not explore all of the reasons behind low confidence but researchers say there are likely to be many factors involved. Some of it may be complacency - if a disease has become less common, then the need to get immunised may feel less pressing when weighing the benefits against any possible risk. All medicines, vaccines included, can have side-effects. But vaccines are thoroughly tested to check they are safe and effective. The internet means beliefs and concerns about vaccines can be shared in an instant, spreading information that isn't necessarily based on fact. In Japan, concerns about the HPV vaccine and a reported link with neurological problems were widely publicised, which experts think knocked confidence in immunisation in general. Similarly, in France, there was controversy about a pandemic influenza vaccine - accusations that the government bought high quantities of the vaccine and unsubstantiated claims that it had been made too quickly and couldn't be safe. In the UK, there has been misinformation circulating about the MMR jab and autism. Dr Lindstrand said: \"One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have.\" Interactive tool produced by Becky Dale and Christine Jeavans; design by Debie Loizou; development by Scott Jarvis and Katia Artsenkova",

    "text": "\"What the co-leader has done is treason, provocation,\" Mr Erdogan said, referring to Mr Demirtas, co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). At the weekend the HDP and other pro-Kurdish groups called for self-rule in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east. Turkish prosecutors have launched an investigation into those comments. The Turkish military has stepped up operations against the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is fighting for Kurdish self-rule. The army says it has killed more than 200 PKK militants in the latest fighting. The PKK is regarded as a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey, the US and EU. 'Challenging the constitution' The HDP won 59 seats in Turkey's 550-seat parliament in the 1 November elections. It came third, behind Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP). Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Erdogan said Mr Demirtas and other Kurdish leaders would be \"taught a lesson\" by the people and the law. He accused Mr Demirtas of challenging Article 14 of the constitution, which bans activities deemed to \"violate the indivisible integrity of the state\". On Sunday Mr Demirtas backed a declaration by a Kurdish umbrella group - the Democratic Society Congress (DTK) - which called for \"autonomous regions\" and \"self-governance bodies\". Little room to talk about rights - Rengin Arslan, BBC Turkish: After 30 years of fighting between Turkish security forces and PKK militants, there has been little progress on the Kurdish issue. The AKP has taken some steps towards improving the cultural rights of the Kurds, including on the official use of the Kurdish language, during its 13-year rule. But many of the Kurds' demands, such as the right to an education in Kurdish, have not been met. Self-rule has been discussed for decades. The idea is now being promoted by a legitimate political party, the HDP, and the umbrella organisation DTK. But with the recent upsurge in fighting in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east - with government-imposed curfews and Kurdish militias fighting in the streets - there is little room to talk about rights. The declaration, issued in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, said the \"rightful resistance\" of Kurds against Turkish state policies \"is essentially a demand and struggle for local self-governance and local democracy\". It called for the \"formation of autonomous regions, to involve several neighbouring provinces in consideration of cultural, economic and geographic affinities\". The PKK has been battling the Turkish military for three decades, in a separatist conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.",

    "text": "The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. People left off the list will have 120 days to appeal against their exclusion. It is unclear what happens next. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. It has already detained thousands of people suspected of being foreigners in temporary camps which are housed in the state's prisons, but deportation is currently not an option for the country. The process has also sparked criticism of \"witch hunts\" against Assam's ethnic minorities. A draft version of the list published last year had four million people excluded. What is the registry of citizens? The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in Assam and is therefore Indian, and who might be a migrant from neighbouring Bangladesh. The register has been updated for the first time. Families in the state have been required to provide documentation to show their lineage, with those who cannot prove their citizenship deemed illegal foreigners. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long railed against illegal immigration in India but has made the NRC a priority in recent years. An anxious wait By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Assam A small community centre in the village of Katajhar is being guarded by two members of the Indian army. Outside, a line of people wait. Some are clutching plastic bags containing documents. As they enter one of two rooms, an official runs his eyes down a print-out to see if their names or photos are on it. This list - the National Register of Citizens - is one with huge consequences. And so there's fear and trepidation as people here find out whether they've been included. Many here who haven't made it tell me it's a mistake as they show me paperwork they say proves they belong in this country. None of Asia Khatun's family of nine made the list. They now have the chance to appeal but there's real fear about what might come next. \"I'd rather die than go to a detention centre,\" she tells me. People here are angry but they're also scared. Why is the registry happening in Assam? Assam is one India's most multi-ethnic states. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living there. Among its residents are Bengali and Assamese-speaking Hindus, as well as a medley of tribespeople. A third of the state's 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a 4,000-km long border with India, has been a concern there for decades now. The government said in 2016 that an estimated 20 million illegal immigrants were living in India. So have 1.9 million people effectively become stateless? Not quite. Residents excluded from the list can appeal to the specially formed courts called Foreigners Tribunals, as well as the high court and Supreme Court. However, a potentially long and exhaustive appeals process will mean that India's already overburdened courts will be further clogged, and poor people left off the list will struggle to raise money to fight their cases. If people lose their appeals in higher courts, they could be detained indefinitely. Some 1,000 people declared as foreigners earlier are already lodged in six detention centres located in prisons. Mr Modi's government is also building an exclusive detention centre, which can hold 3,000 detainees. \"People whose names are not on the final list are really anxious about what lies ahead. One of the reasons is that the Foreigners Tribunal does not have a good reputation, and many people are worried that they will have to go through this process,\" Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty, author of Assam: The Accord, The Discord, told the BBC. Why have been the courts so controversial? The special courts were first set up in 1964, and since then they have declared more than 100,000 people foreigners. They regularly identify \"doubtful voters\" or \"illegal infiltrators\" as foreigners to be deported. But the workings of the specially formed Foreigners Tribunals, which have been hearing the contested cases, have been mired in controversy. There are more than 200 such courts in Assam today, and their numbers are expected to go up to 1,000 by October. The majority of these tribunals were set up after the BJP came to power in 2014. The courts have been accused of bias and their workings have often been opaque and riddled with inconsistencies. For one thing, the burden of proof is on the accused or the alleged foreigner. For another, many families are unable to produce documents due to poor record-keeping, illiteracy or because they lack the money to file a legal claim. People have been declared foreigners by the courts because of differences in spellings of names or ages in voter rolls, and problems in getting identity documents certified by authorities. Amnesty International has described the work by the special courts as \"shoddy and lackadaisical\". Journalist Rohini Mohan analysed more than 500 judgements by these courts in one district and found 82% of the people on trial had been declared foreigners. She also found more Muslims had been declared foreigners, and 78% of the orders were delivered without the accused being ever heard - the police said they were \"absconding\", but Mohan found many of them living in their villages and unaware they had been declared foreigners. \"The Foreigners Tribunal,\" she says, \"must be made more transparent and accountable.\" A decorated Indian army veteran, Mohammed Sanaullah spent 11 days in a detention camp in June after being declared a \"foreigner\", prompting national outrage. Both the citizen's register and the tribunals have also sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Have the minorities been targeted? Many say the list has nothing to do with religion, but activists see it as targeting the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. They also point to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Bangladesh. However significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus have also been left off the citizenship list, underscoring the communal and ethnic tensions in the state \"One of the communities worst affected by the list are the Bengali Hindus. There are as many of them in detention camps as Muslims. This is also the reason just days before NRC is to be published the BJP has changed tack, from taking credit for it to calling it error-ridden. That is because the Bengali Hindus are a strong voter base of the BJP,\" says Barooah Pisharoty. The human tragedy Fearing possible loss of citizenship and detention after exclusion from the list, scores of Bengali Hindus and Muslims have killed themselves since the process to update the citizen register started in 2015, activists say. And in an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. Detainees have complained of poor living conditions and overcrowding in the detention centres. One detainee told a rights group after his release he had been taken to a room which had a capacity for 40 people, but was filled with around 120 people. People who have been declared foreigners as well as many inmates have been suffering from depression. Children have also been detained with their parents. Human rights activist Harsh Mander, who visited two detention centres, has spoken about a situation of \"grave and extensive human distress and suffering\". What happens to people who are declared foreigners? The BJP which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Many believe that India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo that of the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. It is not clear whether the people stripped of their Indian citizenship will be able to access welfare or own property. One possibility is that once they are released, they will be given work permits with some basic rights, but will not be allowed to vote. Read more on the NRC:",

    "text": "He said failure to act could embolden Iran and lead to war, which he said would ruin the global economy. The prince was speaking after an attack on oil facilities which he blames on Tehran. Iran said the remarks would \"bring [the Saudis] nothing but shame\". Mohammed bin Salman also said he accepted some responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. But, speaking to CBS News, he denied personally ordering it. The prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, is suspected of personally targeting Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes news programme on Sunday, he said: \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it [the killing] was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\" However, he denied ordering the killing of Mr Khashoggi directly, or having knowledge of it at the time. Saudi authorities have since blamed a \"rogue\" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. You may also be interested in: The prince also appeared to offer talks for a political solution to the civil war in Yemen, where government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting Houthi rebels supported by Iran. Iran is Saudi Arabia's regional rival and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power. US-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year, with the US blaming Iran on attacks on six oil tankers in the Gulf between May and July. Tehran rejects the accusations. Remarks betray Saudi vulnerability There are subtle clues in this interview as to why the Saudi response to the 14 September drone and missile attacks has been so restrained. Note that the crown prince warns that a war with Iran would be catastrophic, not just for his country but for the global economy. Four years ago, when MBS committed his forces to the disastrous war in Yemen, his response might have been bolder. But the Yemen war has not gone as the Saudis intended while their enemy, the Houthi rebels, are launching ever increasing numbers of drones and missiles across the common border. The recent attacks on the Saudi oil industry, widely blamed on Iran, did real damage. So the Saudis now know just how vulnerable their critical infrastructure is to any Iranian strike. On the Khashoggi murder, the crown prince's \"taking of responsibility\" is a belated acknowledgment of how much unease there still is about this incident in the West. But that, of course, is not the same as admitting any involvement in it, which he and his government still deny. What about the crown prince's oil warning? Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities earlier in September, which knocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. But Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, said: \"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. \"Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes.\" He said the Middle East region \"represents about 30% of the world's energy supplies, about 20% of global trade passages, about 4% of the world GDP\". \"Imagine all of these three things stop. This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,\" the prince said. He blamed Iranian \"stupidity\" for the attacks, saying there was no strategic goal. Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and seven cruise missiles were fired on the country's two oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have said they were behind the attacks. A week after the facilities were hit, the US pledged to send troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend against further attacks. What did he say about Yemen? The prince urged Iran to cease its support for Houthi rebels, saying it would be \"much easier\" to bring the war to an end. \"Today we open all initiatives for a political solution in Yemen,\" he said. \"We hope this happens today rather than tomorrow.\" He welcomed a Houthi ceasefire, announced several days ago, as a \"positive step\" towards political dialogue. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population requiring humanitarian assistance or protection. More than 70,000 people are believed to have died since 2016 as a result of the conflict, according to UN estimates. What about jailed women's rights activists? The crown prince said he would \"personally follow up\" on allegations that women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was tortured in jail. Ms Hathloul and other activists have been in custody for more than a year, despite organising a successful campaign for rights such as that of a woman to drive and travel without a man's permission. But the prince said the decision whether or not to release the activists lay not with him, but with the public prosecutor. Asked why they had been jailed, he said laws had to be respected, even though there were some he disagreed with.",

It added that there are no infections aboard any ships or submarines. India has 11,906 active infections and 480 deaths, according to the latest data from the ministry of health. The Navy said that they had tested a number of personnel who had come into contact with a soldier who had tested positive earlier this month. Many of those who had tested positive for the virus, the statement added, were asymptomatic. They are all currently undergoing treatment. All 21 personnel live in the same residential block, which has been declared a containment zone and has been placed under lockdown. In a video message to personnel last week, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed the importance of keeping ships and submarines free of the virus. \"The coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented and it has never been seen before. Its impact has been extraordinary across the globe, including India,\" he said. The navy has been playing an active role in India's response to the Covid-19 outbreak. It has set up isolation facilities to treat patients at one of its premier hospital units and is also running quarantine camps. The outbreak aboard the Indian naval base follows reports of outbreaks aboard vessels belonging to other nations. More than 500 sailors on the USS Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and one of them died earlier this week.

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News The devices, which are rapidly growing in popularity, produce a vapour containing nicotine. The findings, presented at the European Respiratory Society, showed similar numbers quitting with e-cigarettes as patches, but more had cut down. There was a call, however, for long-term data on safety. As well as giving a nicotine hit, the e-cigarettes also mimic the sensory sensations of smoking. This has led to speculation that they may be a useful tool for people trying to quit. A team at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, conducted the first clinical trial comparing the devices with nicotine patches in 657 people. The results published in the Lancet showed 7.3% using e-cigarettes had quit after six months compared with 5.8% using patches. However, the study did not involve enough people to definitively prove which is the better option. After six months, however, the 57% of e-cigarette users had halved the number of cigarettes smoked each day compared with 41% in those using patches. 'Increasing popularity' Prof Chris Bullen, from the University of Auckland, said: \"While our results don't show any clear-cut differences between e-cigarettes and patches in terms of 'quit success' after six months, it certainly seems that e-cigarettes were more effective in helping smokers who didn't quit to cut down. \"It's also interesting that the people who took part in our study seemed to be much more enthusiastic about e-cigarettes than patches. \"Given the increasing popularity of these devices in many countries, and the accompanying regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency, larger, longer-term trials are urgently needed to establish whether these devices might be able to fulfil their potential as effective and popular smoking cessation aids.\" Regulations around the world are catching up with the surge in the popularity of e-cigarettes. The EU and the UK are both working towards regulating e-cigarettes in the same way as medicines. The products also divide opinion with some arguing they normalise smoking and others saying they may help people to give up. Prof Peter Hajek, the director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London, described the study as \"pioneering\". \"The key message is that in the context of minimum support, e-cigarettes are at least as effective as nicotine patches. \"E-cigarettes are also more attractive than patches to many smokers, and can be accessed in most countries without the restrictions around medicines that apply to nicotine replacement therapy or the costly involvement of health professionals. \"These advantages suggest that e-cigarettes have the potential to increase rates of smoking cessation and reduce costs to quitters and to health services.\" However, he did call for longer-term studies into the consequences of using the devices.

    "text": "On Tuesday, the logo was scrapped, and suggestions such as ninjas and paper cranes as well as the hashtag \"#unofficialemblem\" in Japanese started being shared widely. Return of the wreath One particularly popular idea is for Tokyo to reuse the logo it had during its Olympic bid as a candidate city. Created by design student Ai Shimamine, the logo depicts a wreath of cherry blossoms, one of Japan's most celebrated flowers. It has a somewhat morbid origin - she said in an interview that she got the idea from a scene in an unnamed film where a wreath was laid on a grave. But it was given a hopeful spin by the Olympic bid committee. The wreath -which symbolises a return - has two meanings in the logo, according to committee chief Masato Mizuno. \"It is the idea of 'coming back again'... the Olympic Games coming back to Tokyo and Japan coming back (from the Fukushima disaster),\" he said in 2011. Tokyo last hosted the Games in 1964. Fan art One of the idea being most widely shared on social media is a logo of a fan designed by illustrator Kan Kan. The designer said the fan represented good luck and is traditionally used for cheering, adding: \"With this fan I am expressing many people's support for Japan.\" Sunrise Twitter user Zanma1 said his design was a nod to Japan's moniker Land of the Rising Sun. Ninja tactics A tongue-in-cheek riff on a Japanese icon came from a band called The Ninja, whose design incorporates the star-shaped shuriken weapon. Taking flight A popular motif is the paper crane, which represents peace and good luck in Japanese culture. It is usually given to people in hospital to wish them a speedy recovery, or placed at war memorials as a symbol of peace. Twitter user Shiratori_52 said the Summer Games logo used a red colour symbolising passion and the Olympic flame's \"holy fire\", while the Paralympics logo's colour represented the bright future of disabled people. Meanwhile Eiji Tamura took the opportunity to poke fun at the logo controversy with a design which he said he came up with within 10 minutes. \"Since the situation is such a mess, I've created my own. I've used origami cranes and cherry blossoms to symbolise people's hopes and so you can really feel the Japanese culture,\" he said on Twitter. Controversy The suggestions came almost immediately after Tokyo announced it was scrapping designer Kenjiro Sano's logo. It was unveiled only last month, based around the letter T and a red circle representing a beating heart. Mr Sano said he did not plagiarise, but others have pointed out similarities with the logo for a Belgian theatre. Reporting by Mariko Oi and Tessa Wong.",

    "text": "Covid-19 is an entirely new disease, which disproportionately affects older people. The deadly strain of influenza that swept the globe in 1918 tended to strike those aged between 20 and 30, with strong immune systems. But the actions taken by governments and individuals to prevent the spread of infection have a familiar ring to them. Public Health England studied the Spanish flu outbreak to draw up its initial contingency plan for coronavirus, the key lesson being that the second wave of the disease, in the autumn of 1918, proved to be far more deadly than the first. Britain was still at war when the virus claimed its first recorded victim, in May 1918. The government, like many others, was caught on the hop. It appears to have decided that the war effort took precedence over preventing flu deaths. The disease spread like wildfire in crowded troop transports and munitions factories, and on buses and trains, according to a 1919 report by Sir Arthur Newsholme for the Royal Society of Medicine. But a \"memorandum for public use\" he had written in July 1918, that advised people to stay at home if they were sick and to avoid large gatherings, was buried by the government. Sir Arthur argued that many lives could have been saved if these rules had been followed, but he added: \"There are national circumstances in which the major duty is to 'carry on', even when risk to health and life is involved.\" The flu did not originate in Spain, but Spain was the first country to report deaths from it, leading to the assumption that it must have started there. Spain's newspapers were not subject to wartime censorship, because it was a neutral country. News of the epidemic was initially suppressed in other countries to avoid damaging morale. In 1918, there were no treatments for influenza and no antibiotics to treat complications such as pneumonia. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. There was no centrally imposed lockdown to curb the spread of infection, although many theatres, dance halls, cinemas and churches were closed, in some cases for months. Pubs, which were already subject to wartime restrictions on opening hours, mostly stayed open. The Football League and the FA Cup had been cancelled for the war, but there was no effort to cancel other matches or limit crowds, with men's teams playing in regional competitions, and women's football, which attracted large crowds, continuing throughout the pandemic. Streets in some towns and cities were sprayed with disinfectant and some people wore anti-germ masks, as they went about their daily lives. Public health messages were confused - and, just like today, fake news and conspiracy theories abounded, although the general level of ignorance about healthy lifestyles did not help. In some factories, no-smoking rules were relaxed, in the belief that cigarettes would help prevent infection. During a Commons debate on the pandemic, Conservative MP Claude Lowther asked: \"Is it a fact that a sure preventative against influenza is cocoa taken three times a day?\" Publicity campaigns and leaflets warned against spreading disease through coughs and sneezes. In November 1918, the News of the World advised its readers to: \"wash inside nose with soap and water each night and morning; force yourself to sneeze night and morning, then breathe deeply. Do not wear a muffler; take sharp walks regularly and walk home from work; eat plenty of porridge.\" No country was untouched by the 1918 pandemic, although the scale of its impact, and of government efforts to protect their populations, varied widely. In the United States, some states imposed quarantines on their citizens, with mixed results, while others tried to make the wearing of face masks compulsory. Cinemas, theatres and other places of entertainment were closed across the country. New York was better prepared than most US cities, having already been through a 20-year campaign against tuberculosis, and as a result suffered a lower death rate. Nevertheless, the city's health commissioner came under pressure from businesses to keep premises open, particularly movie theatres and other places of entertainment. Then, as now, fresh air was seen as a potential bulwark against the spread of infection, leading to some ingenious solutions to keep society going. But it proved impossible to prevent mass gatherings in many US cities, particularly at places of worship. By the end of the pandemic, the death toll in Britain was 228,000, and a quarter of the population are thought to have been infected. Efforts to kill the virus continued for some time, and the population were more aware than ever of the potentially deadly nature of seasonal influenza. All photographs subject to copyright",

The product is typically between 3% and 8% alcohol by volume. A senior Coke executive in Japan said the move was a \"modest experiment for a specific slice of our market\". \"We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas,\" said Jorge Garduno, Coca-Cola's Japan president. It was unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan, he suggested. Chu-Hi - an abbreviation for shochu highball - has been marketed as an alternative to beer, proving especially popular with female drinkers. Japan's big drinks firms including Kirin, Suntory and Asahi all have varieties of the drink, and continue to experiment with flavours. The most popular flavours are strong citrus ones such as grapefruit or lemon, but the drink can also be made with other fruit flavours like grape, apple and peach. 'Premium segments' As younger consumers become more health conscious, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands. But last November, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog speculated that Coca-Cola might move into alcohol, as it looked to \"premium segments such as adult craft beverages\". The phrase alcopop typically refers to sweet but alcoholic drinks, and in 1990s UK brands such as Hooch, Reef, Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezer became hugely popular. But they were controversial, raising concerns that they encouraged young people to drink alcohol in large quantities because they were so easy to consume.",

    "text": "\"This place is more than half of my life,\" says Gennady Laptev. The broad-shouldered Ukrainian scientist is smiling wistfully as we stand on the now dry ground of what was Chernobyl nuclear power plant's cooling pond. \"I was only 25 when I started my work here as a liquidator. Now, I'm almost 60.\" There were thousands of liquidators - workers who came here as part of the mammoth, dangerous clean-up operation following the 1986 explosion. The worst nuclear accident in history. Gennady shows me a coffee table-sized platform, installed here to collect dust. This reservoir's bed dried out when the pumps taking water from the nearby river were finally switched off in 2014; 14 years after the remaining three reactors there were shut down. Analysing dust for radioactive contamination is just a small part of the decades-long study of this vast, abandoned area. The accident turned this landscape into a giant, contaminated laboratory, where hundreds of scientists have worked to find out how an environment recovers from nuclear catastrophe. The experiment that turned into a global catastrophe On 26 April, 1986, at 1:23AM, engineers cut power to some systems at Chernobyl nuclear power plant's number 4 reactor. It was a critical point in a test to understand what would happen during a blackout. What engineers did not know was that the reactor was already unstable. The cut-off slowed turbines that drove cooling water to the reactor. As less water turned to more steam, the pressure inside built. By the time operators realised what was happening and tried to shut down the reactor, it was too late. A steam explosion blew the lid off the reactor, exposing the core to the atmosphere. Two people in the plant were killed and, as air fuelled a fire that burned for 10 days, a cloud of radioactive smoke and dust was carried on the wind around Europe. BBC News Our World: In the Shadow of Chernobyl - Watch Victoria Gill's full report from the exclusion zone on Saturday and Sunday, 16 and 17 February, at 2130 GMT on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer. The first emergency workers rushed in as lethal smoke billowed out. Of 134 who were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness, 28 died within months. At least 19 have died since. Gennady, an environmental scientist with the Ukrainian HydroMeteorological Institute, started work in the zone just three months after the evacuation. \"We used to fly in by helicopter every day from Kiev,\" he explains, \"to collect water and soil samples. \"The important thing then was to understand the extent of the contamination - to draw the first maps of the exclusion zone.\" Today, that zone spans Ukraine and Belarus. Covering more than 4,000 sq km - more than twice the size of London. Every community within a 30km radius of the plant was evacuated and abandoned; no-one was allowed to return here to live. In a forgotten, outer portion of the exclusion zone, people were quietly allowed to return home a few months after the disaster. Unlike the \"30km zone\", no checkpoints prevent entry to this semi-abandoned area. Narodichi, a town of more than 2,500 people, is within that more-distant zone. Strict rules govern this officially contaminated district; exclusion zone land must not be cultivated to produce food and it cannot be developed. Today, though, this part of Ukraine is not easily delineated into two categories - contaminated or clean. Research has shown that Chernobyl's aftermath is more complicated, and the landscape here much stranger - and more interesting - than the stringent \"do not touch\" rules in Narodichi would imply. Fear of radiation could actually be hurting the people of Narodichi far more than the radiation itself. 'We're getting less radiation here than on the plane' Over Gennady's shoulder, I can see the nuclear power plant - less than a kilometre away from the reservoir bed we're standing on. Gleaming in the sunshine is the huge protective steel \"New Safe Confinement\" that now entombs unit 4. It was slid over the top of the accident's epicentre in 2016. Beneath it, robotic cranes are dismantling 33-year-old, radioactive wreckage. Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth, a colleague of Gennady's, is a scientist who has studied the aftermath of the disaster since 1990. Here on one of his numerous research trips to the zone, he shows me a dosimeter - a black plastic phone-sized gadget he carries throughout the visit. It measures the external dose of radiation he is getting from the environment. Atoms of the nuclear fuel dust that were scattered here by the 1986 explosion are spontaneously breaking down. They are giving out high-energy rays as they do so, and Jim's dosimeter is detecting the dose of those that we are receiving every hour. The readings are in units (called microsieverts) that only make sense to me in the context of other relatively \"radioactive activities\". At one point in the middle of the flight to Kiev - for example - his dosimeter read 1.8 microsieverts per hour. \"It's currently 0.6,\" Jim says. \"So that's about [a third] of what we were getting on the flight.\" With the infamous power plant visible in the background, I'm incredulous. But, Jim explains, we live on a radioactive planet - natural radioactivity is all around us. \"It comes from the Sun's rays, from the food we eat, from the Earth,\" he says. That is why, up at 12,000m on an airliner, with less shielding from Earth's atmosphere, we receive a higher dose. \"Yes, the exclusion zone is contaminated,\" he tells me, \"but if we would put it on a map of radiation dose worldwide - only the small 'hotspots' would stand out. \"Natural radioactivity is all around us - it varies from country to country, from place to place. Most of the area of the exclusion zone gives rise to lower radiation dose rates than many areas of natural radioactivity worldwide.\" 'You don't want to be in the hotspots for long' While the boundary of the exclusion zone has not changed, the landscape has - almost beyond recognition. Where people were forced out, nature has moved in. Wilderness combined with abandoned buildings, farms and villages gives a sense of the post-apocalyptic. Jim and his colleagues spend their days here collecting samples and planting cameras and audio recorders, which silently gather information about what wildlife inhabits this post-human place, and how the radiation affects it. On the second day of our trip to the zone, I follow the team into the Red Forest. This is an exclusion zone hotspot that, because of the direction of the winds in 1986, took the brunt of the shower of radioactive material. We put on dust suits to avoid contaminating our clothing. In the forest, Jim's dosimeter reads 35 - almost 60 times the external dose we were getting in the cooling pond. \"We don't want to be here for too long,\" says Jim. He and the team gather their soil samples swiftly, take some photographs and head back to the car. 'The horses are adapting to the zone' In the abandoned village of Burayakovka - just over 10km from the power plant - it is a very different approach. Jim and the team take their time exploring the area. The dosimeter reads 1.0 - still less than on the flight. Inside one small, crumbling but still colourful wooden house, the sad truth of what people so suddenly lost here is apparent. A coat still slung over the arm of a chair is now covered in three decades of dust. But what people left behind - through farming and gardening - has turned into a strangely rich habitat and provisions for wild animals. Long-term studies have shown that there is more wildlife in the abandoned villages than anywhere else in the zone. Brown bears, lynx and wild boar are seen roaming here. Dr Maryna Shkvyria, a researcher based at Kiev Zoo, has spent years tracking and studying the larger mammals that moved in when people moved out. There are studies suggesting that birds in the most contaminated areas show signs of damage to their DNA, but Maryna's work is adding to a catalogue of research that suggests wildlife is thriving throughout much of the exclusion zone. Chernobyl's wolves, she says, are a particularly striking example. \"After 15 years of studying them, we have a lot of information about their behaviour,\" Maryna explains. \"And the Chernobyl wolf is one of the most natural wolves in Ukraine.\" By \"natural\", she means there is very little \"human food\" in the wolves' diet. \"Usually, wolves are around settlements,\" Maryna explains. \"They can eat livestock, crops and waste food - even pets.\" But not here where wolves hunt wild prey. Chernobyl's wolves feed on deer and even catch fish. Some images - caught by camera traps - reveal gentler dietary habits. Wolves have been snapped eating fruit from around trees that used to be in people's orchards. There is one group of animals that has made the zone its home and that - strictly speaking- should not really be here. In 1998, Ukrainian zoologists released a herd of 30 endangered Przewalski's horses in the zone. The apparent aim was for the horses to graze overgrowth and reduce the risk of wildfire. There are now about 60 of them - in herds dispersed across Ukraine and Belarus. They are native to the open plains of Mongolia, so forests peppered with abandoned buildings should not be ideal habitat. \"But they're really using the forests,\" explains Maryna. \"We even put camera traps in old barns and buildings and they're using them to [shelter] from mosquitoes and heat. \"They even lay down and sleep inside - they're adapting to the zone.\" 'You can have the cherry vodka; I made it' Wildlife might be making the most of what's gradually become a post-human nature reserve, but not every village was left for animals to claim. Some people still live here - deep in the 30km zone. On my fourth day here, we visit Maria's house. She is outside in her garden when we arrive at the gate, and - as I try to introduce myself in a few stumbling words of Ukrainian - she interrupts me by wrapping me in a warm hug and kissing me on the cheek. Today is her 78th birthday. She is expecting us and has prepared a celebratory breakfast. Maria ushers me, Jim, his colleague Mike, and our interpreter Denis to a wooden table under a fruit tree. It is a gloriously sunny day and pleasantly warm even at 9am. Maria starts to bring food - fatty salted bacon, a whole fish, sliced sausage and steaming hot, home-grown potatoes. There are two bottles of what appear to be spirits - one colourless, one dark red. \"If you don't like this vodka, you can have the cherry one - I made it,\" she says. Maria and her neighbours make up a tiny community of just 15. Each of these self-settlers, as they are known, travelled back across a patchily enforced exclusion zone boundary and reclaimed their homes in 1986. Almost every family forced to leave here was given an apartment in a nearby town or city. For Maria and her mother, though, this cottage, with the garden wrapped around it, was home. They refused to abandon it. \"We weren't allowed to come back, but I followed my mum,\" Maria recalls. \"She was 88 back then. She kept saying: 'I will go, I will go'. I just followed her.\" There are about 200 self-settlers in total living in the zone and, for an ageing population cut off from the rest of the country, Maria says life is not easy. \"We're all very old,\" she tells me. \"And we take each day as it comes. \"I feel full of life when my children come to visit me from Kiev. Otherwise, it's not so interesting to live here. But you know this is our land - our motherland. It's irreplaceable.\" Maria's mobile phone rings and I am struck by the incongruity of our diminutive babushka hostess, standing in her exclusion zone garden, apparently trying to wrap up swiftly a call from her daughter. She is busy with her visitors from the BBC! Remote as it is, this is a close community. As we sit in the garden (knocking back cherry vodka at our Maria's repeated insistence) her neighbour arrives with a birthday gift. She sits on the bench near the garden gate; she can't walk too far. The self-settlers are a tiny minority, though. Most people who so suddenly lost their homes here have no hope of coming back. Most of them lived in Pripyat - a true Soviet dream town, purpose-built for the power plant workers. Just a few kilometres from the plant itself, this town of 50,000 people was emptied overnight. No-one was allowed to return; it is now the archetype of a 20th Century ghost city. Pripyat was, however, recently deemed safe to visit for short periods and has now become one of Ukraine's most talked about tourist attractions. An estimated 60,000 people visited the exclusion zone last year, keen to witness the dramatic decay. Its bleak notoriety has made it the subject of some dark, social media-based showing-off. Search #chernobyl on Instagram and you will find - among the interesting landscapes and tourist snaps - images of anonymous, costumed characters, sometimes wearing gas masks or holding up creepy-looking dolls for the camera. 'Tell people Chernobyl is not such a horrible place' The town of Chernobyl itself - somewhat confusingly much further from the power plant than Pripyat - is in a less contaminated area. It has become a relatively populous hub. Power plant decommissioning staff, scientists and tourists stay here. Gennady, Jim, me and the rest of the research team are staying in one of its small hotels - a Soviet-style building with an incongruously pretty, well-tended garden around it. This greenery is looked after by Irina, who manages the hotel. She stays here for three months at a time before a colleague takes over. People are only permitted to live in the town for limited periods. Over a cup of tea on our second evening at the hotel, Gennady translates as Irina tells us about her memories of the accident. She lived in Pripyat at the time with her grandmother. On 27 April - a day after the explosion - the town was evacuated. People were ordered to leave immediately. They lined up for buses that would take them away from the town and the plant. Irina was on her way back to her grandmother's apartment at the time. \"A friend of my grandmother's was driving a cattle wagon - taking his livestock out,\" she recalled. \"My grandmother asked if he would take me with him, so I climbed on to the cattle wagon. \"I didn't know what was happening.\" But Irina, not unlike Maria, felt a need to return to the zone. She has never been back to Pripyat, though; it would upset her too much to see it now. But she takes pride in tending the flowers around her Chernobyl hotel. \"I like to make it as pretty as possible for the visitors,\" she tells me. \"So maybe you can tell people back home that Chernobyl is not such a horrible place.\" 'We have forgotten that we are Chernobyl people' Gennady's 33 years working in the exclusion zone might have been leading up to one meeting at the end of this week. It is being held in a school in Narodichi, the town in the outer zone. Here, scientists, community members, medical experts and officials from the state agency that manages the exclusion zone are gathering to discuss a change that could transform this district's future. For the first time since the boundary was drawn, the zone is set to change. Three decades of research have concluded that much of it is safe - for food to be grown and for the land to be developed. Narodichi is one of its least contaminated places. Jim and Gennady are presenting their conclusions at the meeting. Before it is under way, I have arranged to visit the town's kindergarten, where the children are playing outside in the sunshine. A rainbow-painted picket fence at the edge of their playground contrasts almost ludicrously with grey, half-built tower blocks next door. There were 360 children here before the accident. Tatiana Kravchenko, a woman with a perpetual kind smile and who is wearing a thick, bright pink coat, is the kindergarten manager. She remembers the evacuation. \"The children were evacuated together with teachers to 'clean zones',\" she recalls. \"In three months we were sent back, and we had only 25 children. Eventually, people have come back, new children have been born and gradually the kindergarten started filling up again. Now we have 130 children here.\" Most of the time, Tatiana says, she does not think of her community as being within the exclusion zone. \"We forget that we are Chernobyl people; we have other issues to deal with,\" she tells me. \"It's no secret that half of the parents [of these kids] are unemployed, because there is nowhere to work. I wish that we could build something here - that our community could start to bloom.\" 'Maybe it's time to redraw the map' Back in the meeting, Gennady peers over red-rimmed glasses, attentively listening to what is being said. Discussions are taking longer than expected. Much of the community input seems to reflect Tatiana's thoughts - that it is time for restrictions to be lifted here. But there is a lot at stake. People affected by the accident receive financial compensation from the government. Here, in a town of high unemployment, in a country where the average wage is less than 400USD per month, that income is important. And many still fear Chernobyl radiation - and the effect that it might still have on their health, and the health of their children. After many years of research, understanding and explaining the long-term health legacy of the accident has been infuriatingly complicated. It is conclusive that around 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer - most of which were treated and cured - were caused by the contamination. Authorities failed to prevent contaminated milk from being sold in the region; many who were children at the time drank it receiving large doses of radioactive iodine. That was one of the contaminants blasted out of the reactor. Many suspect that the radiation has or will cause other cancers, but the evidence is patchy. Prof Richard Wakeford, from the University of Manchester's Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, points out that health studies look for a \"signal\" of a specific health effect linked to Chernobyl. They aim to pick out that signal above the \"background noise\" from other causes. That has been incredibly difficult, primarily because of the huge background noise that was the almost simultaneous upheaval of the Soviet Union's collapse. \"It's assumed that there will be some cancers linked to the accident in addition to the thyroid cancers, but detecting them amid that socioeconomic chaos - that had its own impacts on people's health - has proven almost impossible,\" says Prof Wakeford. Cancer also affects between a third and a half of people in Europe, so any Chernobyl signal is likely to be small. Amid reports of other health problems - including birth defects - it still is not clear if any can be attributed to radiation. Prof Geraldine Thomas from Imperial College London explains: \"Another confounding factor in this part of the world relates, confusingly, to iodine deficiency.\" In its non-radioactive form, iodine is found in milk, green leafy vegetables and seaweed. A lack of it in the diet is a known cause of problems in the early development of the brain and spinal cord. \"So one possible cause of birth defects is actually a lack of iodine in the environment,\" the prof says. All of this means that estimates of cancer cases remain highly contentious. In its seminal 2006 report on the the long-term consequences of the accident, the World Health Organization did conclude that many people's mental health has been damaged - by fear of radiation and severe disruption to their lives. As a scientist who has spent years scrutinising the truth about the contamination in the zone, Gennady admits that he did not expect the people of Narodichi to be afraid of radiation. \"It's a very big factor affecting their lives, even more than 30 years after the accident. This is really something that surprised me,\" he says. That fear can be physically as well as mentally damaging. A sense of fatalism and hopelessness associated with assumptions of being doomed by radiation is thought to contribute to higher rates of of smoking and alcoholism in this region - both of which are definitively bad for people's health. \"It was a terrible thing that happened here,\" says Jim. \"But that tends to dominate people's lives. \"Somehow - and it's very, very difficult - we've got to move towards a situation where people can go back to living their lives without this fear, this radiation blight.\" We're not going anywhere Gennady emerges from the meeting looking a little jaded, but he says he is cautiously optimistic. The map was not officially redrawn today, but, crucially, most people in the room agreed there was a need for change. \"The community wants to bring more life here,\" Gennady says. \"And we, as scientists, know that a lot of places here can be easily excluded from this ban, so I think this was a very positive moment.\" At the kindergarten, Tatiana has ushered the younger children inside for an afternoon nap. There are rows of adorably tiny beds inside a new wing of the kindergarten that was built with money from a Japanese charity. The close relationship between Japan and Ukraine has been forged by the former being in the early stages of understanding the impact of its own nuclear disaster - at the Fukushima power plant. Looking from the pristine new kindergarten building to the neighbouring derelict block, she says she would support the town's removal from the zone. \"These houses could be reconstructed and filled with people. We dream about that. \"We live here. We are not going to leave for anywhere else. Our children live here.\" By BBC Science Correspondent Victoria Gill. Photographs by Jemma Cox.

Gangnam Style became a worldwide hit when it was released in 2012, largely due to the surreal video. How do you say 9,223,372,036,854,775,808?

    "text": "At a halfway house in Hiroshima - for criminals who are being released from jail back into the community - 69-year-old Toshio Takata tells me he broke the law because he was poor. He wanted somewhere to live free of charge, even if it was behind bars. \"I reached pension age and then I ran out of money. So it occurred to me - perhaps I could live for free if I lived in jail,\" he says. \"So I took a bicycle and rode it to the police station and told the guy there: 'Look, I took this.'\" The plan worked. This was Toshio's first offence, committed when he was 62, but Japanese courts treat petty theft seriously, so it was enough to get him a one-year sentence. Small, slender, and with a tendency to giggle, Toshio looks nothing like a habitual criminal, much less someone who'd threaten women with knives. But after he was released from his first sentence, that's exactly what he did. \"I went to a park and just threatened them. I wasn't intending to do any harm. I just showed the knife to them hoping one of them would call the police. One did.\" Altogether, Toshio has spent half of the last eight years in jail. I ask him if he likes being in prison, and he points out an additional financial upside - his pension continues to be paid even while he's inside. \"It's not that I like it but I can stay there for free,\" he says. \"And when I get out I have saved some money. So it is not that painful.\" Toshio represents a striking trend in Japanese crime. In a remarkably law-abiding society, a rapidly growing proportion of crimes is carried about by over-65s. In 1997 this age group accounted for about one in 20 convictions but 20 years later the figure had grown to more than one in five - a rate that far outstrips the growth of the over-65s as a proportion of the population (though they now make up more than a quarter of the total). And like Toshio, many of these elderly lawbreakers are repeat offenders. Of the 2,500 over-65s convicted in 2016, more than a third had more than five previous convictions. Another example is Keiko (not her real name). Seventy years old, small, and neatly presented, she also tells me that it was poverty that was her undoing. \"I couldn't get along with my husband. I had nowhere to live and no place to stay. So it became my only choice: to steal,\" she says. \"Even women in their 80s who can't properly walk are committing crime. It's because they can't find food, money.\" We spoke some months ago in an ex-offender's hostel. I've been told she's since been re-arrested, and is now serving another jail-term for shoplifting. Find out more Japan's Elderly Crime Wave can be heard on Assignment on the BBC World Service from Thursday 31 January - click here for transmission times Or listen now online Theft, principally shoplifting, is overwhelmingly the biggest crime committed by elderly offenders. They mostly steal food worth less than 3,000 yen (£20) from a shop they visit regularly. Michael Newman, an Australian-born demographer with the Tokyo-based research house, Custom Products Research Group points out that the \"measly\" basic state pension in Japan is very hard to live on. In a paper published in 2016 he calculates that the costs of rent, food and healthcare alone will leave recipients in debt if they have no other income - and that's before they've paid for heating or clothes. In the past it was traditional for children to look after their parents, but in the provinces a lack of economic opportunities has led many younger people to move away, leaving their parents to fend for themselves. \"The pensioners don't want to be a burden to their children, and feel that if they can't survive on the state pension then pretty much the only way not to be a burden is to shuffle themselves away into prison,\" he says. The repeat offending is a way \"to get back into prison\" where there are three square meals a day and no bills, he says. \"It's almost as though you're rolled out, so you roll yourself back in.\" Newman points out that suicide is also becoming more common among the elderly - another way for them to fulfil what he they may regard as \"their duty to bow out\". The director of \"With Hiroshima\", the rehabilitation centre where I met Toshio Takata, also thinks changes in Japanese families have contributed to the elderly crime wave, but he emphasises the psychological consequences not the financial ones. \"Ultimately the relationship among people has changed. People have become more isolated. They don't find a place to be in this society. They cannot put up with their loneliness,\" says Kanichi Yamada, an 85-year-old who as a child was pulled out of the rubble of his home when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. \"Among the elderly who commit crimes a number have this turning point in their middle life. There is some trigger. They lose a wife or children and they just can't cope with that... Usually people don't commit crime if they have people to look after them and provide them with support.\" Toshio's story about being driven to crime as a result of poverty is just an \"excuse\", Kanichi Yamada suggests. The core of the problem is his loneliness. And one factor that may have prompted him to reoffend, he speculates, was the promise of company in jail. It's true that Toshio is alone in the world. His parents are dead, and he has lost contact with two older brothers, who don't answer his calls. He has also lost contact with his two ex-wives, both of whom he divorced, and his three children. I ask him if he thinks things would have turned out differently if he'd had a wife and family. He says they would. \"If they had been around to support me I wouldn't have done this,\" he says. Michael Newman has watched as the Japanese government has expanded prison capacity, and recruited additional female prison guards (the number of elderly women criminals is rising particularly fast, though from a low base). He's also noted the steeply rising bill for medical treatment of people in prison. You might also be interested in... The plight of Japan's modern hermits I hire a man to pretend to be my daughter's dad - and she doesn't know The Japanese men who prefer virtual girlfriends to sex There have been other changes too, as I see for myself at a prison in Fuchu, outside Tokyo, where nearly a third of the inmates are now over 60. There's a lot of marching inside Japanese prisons - marching and shouting. But here the military drill seems to be getting harder to enforce. I see a couple of grey-haired inmates at the back of one platoon struggling to keep up. One is on crutches. \"We have had to improve the facilities here,\" Masatsugu Yazawa, the prison's head of education tells me. \"We've put in handrails, special toilets. There are classes for older offenders.\" He takes me to watch one of them. It begins with a karaoke rendition of a popular song, The Reason I was Born, all about the meaning of life. The inmates are encouraged to sing along. Some look quite moved. \"We sing to show them that the real life is outside prison, and that happiness is there,\" Yazawa says. \"But still they think the life in prison is better and many come back.\" Michael Newman argues that it would be far better - and much cheaper - to look after the elderly without the expense of court proceedings and incarceration. \"We actually costed a model to build an industrial complex retirement village where people would forfeit half their pension but get free food, free board and healthcare and so on, and get to play karaoke or gate-ball with the other residents and have a relative amount of freedom. It would cost way less than what the government's spending at the moment,\" he says. But he also suggests that the tendency for Japanese courts to hand down custodial sentences for petty theft \"is slightly bizarre, in terms of the punishment actually fitting the crime\". \"The theft of a 200-yen (£1.40) sandwich could lead to an 8.4m-yen (£58,000) tax bill to provide for a two-year sentence,\" he writes in his 2016 report. That may be a hypothetical example, but I met one elderly jailbird whose experience was almost identical. He'd been given a two-year jail term for only his second offence: stealing a bottle of peppers worth £2.50. And I heard from Morio Mochizuki, who provides security for some 3,000 retail outlets in Japan, that if anything the courts are getting tougher on shoplifters. \"Even if they only stole one piece of bread,\" says Masayuki Sho of Japan's Prison Service, \"it was decided at trial that it is appropriate for them to go to prison, therefore we need to teach them the way: how to live in society without committing crime.\" I don't know whether the prison service has taught Toshio Takata this lesson, but when I ask him if he is already planning his next crime, he denies it. \"No, actually this is it,\" he says. \"I don't want to do this again, and I will soon be 70 and I will be old and frail the next time. I won't do that again.\" More from BBC Stories: Just over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul.

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Among the residents are Bengali- and Assamese-speaking Hindus, and a medley of tribespeople. A third of its 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh has been a concern for decades now. A six-year indigenous protest - during which hundreds of people were murdered - led to a 1985 pact between the federal government and protesters. It was agreed that anyone who entered Assam without proper documentation after 24 March 1971 would be declared a foreigner. Now, the publication of the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC) reveals, according to officials, that some four million of Assam's residents are illegal foreigners. Separate specially-formed courts in the last few years had already declared as foreigners some 1,000 residents - mostly Bengali-speaking Muslims - and interned them in half-a-dozen detention camps. In an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. Stripped of their Indian citizenship, the affected people in Assam, many of whom have lived there for decades, will be suddenly unable to vote, access welfare or own property. Those who already own property could easily become targets of envious neighbours. At a time when the UN refugee agency is vowing to end statelessness - there are some 10 million stateless people in the world - this will be a major embarrassment for India. Mr Modi's government has already shown nervousness. A senior minister said people not listed on the NRC would not be kept in detention camps and would be given a last chance to prove their citizenship by the end of the year. At the same time, there are plans to build a vast, new detention camp for people who are unable to prove their citizenship. Also, according to lawyers, people whose names are not on the list can appeal to the special courts. It could take years, if not decades, to decide on the fate of tens of thousands of people. \"In short, this is a complete mess of affairs,\" says Subir Bhaumik, author of Troubled Periphery, a study of India's troubled north-east. \"The potential for chaos is huge. There will be panic among the minorities. Bangladesh will fear an influx of new refugees. Detention camps packed with stateless people will invite international attention, and bleed the exchequer.\" There's little doubt that illegal migration is a serious issue for Assam. Its population has grown at a much higher rate than in the rest of India, raising suspicions of substantial informal migration across the porous borders it shares with Bangladesh. Thousands fled to Assam during the 1971 war with Pakistan. This has hurt the state in more ways than one: land ownership has declined, plot sizes have shrunk and landlessness has risen. Estimates of illegal foreigners range from four million to 10 million. Most of them are engaged in farm work. According to one estimate, they have a sizeable presence in 15 of Assam's 33 districts. Some 100 special courts have already declared more than 85,000 people foreigners since 1985. But many argue that Mr Modi's BJP has whipped up religious tension over the crisis for electoral gain - the party says illegal Muslims should be deported while illegal Hindus can remain. \"Rightly or wrongly the citizenship issue has become a crucial talking point and an issue in Assam politics. Unless it is settled, you cannot go forward,\" says Hiren Gohain, a leading Assamese author and social scientist. \"Who are the genuine citizens in the state and who are the aliens needs to be ascertained.\" A hastily executed citizenship test which has cost India $180m (£137m) so far and has ended up fanning xenophobia and distrust surely cannot be the answer.",

Ms Bachchan, a former Bollywood actress who is very vocal on women's rights issues, led the MPs in demanding justice for the victim. \"I think it is time... The people want the government to give a proper and definite answer,\" she said. Watch: Victim's sister speaks out Vijila Sathyananth, an MP from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the country was not safe for children and women and demanded that the \"four men who committed this crime should be hanged before 31 December. Justice delayed is justice denied\". Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said \"this act has brought shame to the entire country, it has hurt everyone\" and that he didn't have appropriate words to \"condemn this heinous crime\". He said tougher laws that were introduced after the December 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi had given hope that crimes against women would decline. But since that had not happened, Mr Singh said, \"the government is ready for a discussion in the parliament on the issue of crimes against women and willing to explore stringent provisions in laws to check such incidents\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not yet commented on the case. What happened to the victim? The woman had left home on her bike at about 18:00 local time (12:30 GMT) on Wednesday to go to a doctor's appointment. She called her sister later to say that she had a flat tyre, and a lorry driver had offered to help. She said she was waiting near a toll plaza. Efforts to contact her afterwards were unsuccessful, and her body was discovered under a flyover by a milkman early on Thursday morning. Under Indian law, a rape victim cannot be identified even after death, but on Friday the woman's name was the top Twitter trend in the country for several hours as tens of thousands of angry tweets demanded justice. Her photographs have also been shared widely on social media by those demanding justice for her. What has the wider reaction been? At a police station on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Saturday, thousands of people gathered to protest, insisting the culprits must face the death penalty. Elsewhere in the country there were other protests and vigils for the victim. Meanwhile family members of the victim have turned away visiting politicians and police officials, demanding action instead. In the community of Shamshabad in Hyderabad, where she lived, residents locked the main gate and held placards saying: \"No Media, No Police, No Outsiders - No sympathy, only action, justice.\" Three police officers have been suspended following allegations by the victim's family that they had not acted quickly enough when the victim was reported missing. Officers suggested she may have eloped, relatives told the National Commission for Women, a government body. Rape and sexual violence against women have been in focus in India over the past few years but there has been no sign that anti-female violence is abating. According to the latest government crime figures, 33,658 women were raped in India in 2017 - an average of 92 every day.",

Sridevi, as she was known, was 54 when she died during a visit to Dubai to attend a family wedding. She was found unresponsive in her hotel bathtub. Initial reports said she had died of a heart attack but police later said it had been \"due to accidental drowning following loss of consciousness\". \"Sridevi would have been very happy today,\" her widower Boney Kapoor told Indian media after the awards ceremony. \"We miss her, it is a very proud moment at the same time.\" He accepted, alongside their daughters, the prize for her performance in revenge thriller Mom. Actor and politician Vinod Khanna, who died last year, was also honoured at the ceremony in New Delhi. He received India's highest film prize, the Dadasaheb Phalke award. Sridevi had already won six awards for her final role, which was as a vigilante seeking revenge for her step-daughter's gang rape. Sridevi's daughter Janhvi Kapoor wore one of her saris to the awards ceremony. The Bollywood star, who began acting at four years old, had featured in 300 films, including classics Mr India, Chandni and ChaalBaaz. She was considered one of the very few Indian female superstars capable of huge box-office success without the support of a male hero. Thousands of fans, along with stars from the Indian film industry, turned out to pay their respects during her funeral and cremation in Mumbai.",
