    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent It runs a massive immunisation programme, makes 60% of the world's vaccines and is home to half a dozen major manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India - the largest in the world. Not surprisingly, there's no lack of ambition when it comes to vaccinating a billion people against Covid-19. India plans to receive and utilise some 500 million doses of vaccines against the disease and immunise up to 250 million people by July next year. This confidence is bolstered by its track record of immunising large numbers of people every year. India's 42-year-old immunisation programme, one of the world's largest health programmes, targets 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year. The country also has a well-oiled electronic system to stock and track these vaccines. Yet vaccinating a billion people, including hundreds of millions of adults for the first time, against Covid-19 is going to be a daunting and unprecedented challenge, say experts. Five of the 30 vaccine candidates being developed in India are in clinical trials. They include the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which is being tested by Serum and a home-grown one being developed by Bharat BioTech. \"Having a home-grown vaccine is a top priority,\" Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology, told me. From choosing a bouquet of vaccines to grappling with distribution to identifying groups for the early jabs, \"everything is a challenge\", says Dr Gagandeep Kang, a microbiologist and the first Indian woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. \"We are underestimating the complexity of the exercise. It will take at least a couple of years to get half of Indians vaccinated.\" Here are some of the main challenges: Supply chain and logistics India has some 27,000 \"cold chain\" stores from where stocked vaccines can reach more than eight million locations. (Nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain.) Will that be enough? India will also need enough auto-disabled syringes that will prevent reuse and possible reinfection. The country's biggest syringe maker says it will be making a billion such syringes by next year to meet rising demand. Then there are questions about smooth supplies of medical glass vials. And what about the disposal of the huge amount of medical waste that will be generated by this mass vaccination drive? Nearly four million doctors and nurses power India's immunisation programme, but India will need more to carry out Covid vaccinations. \"I worry about how we can [extend all the resources] to rural India,\" Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, founder of Biocon, the country's leading biotechnology enterprise, told me. Who's going to get the early jabs? Vaccine supplies will be tight next year, and deciding who will get the jabs first is going to be tricky. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan says private and government health care workers and frontline workers \"of other departments\" will receive the early doses. Experts believe it's not going to be easy. \"We will never have sufficient supply of vaccines. The prioritisation of recipients is going to be a considerable challenge,\" says epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Consider this. In a country where the majority of healthcare is private, will a private health worker get priority over a public one? Will permanent workers get priority over people working on contracts? If elderly people with underlying conditions are eligible for early shots, how will different co-morbidities be prioritised? India, for example, has more than 70 million diabetics, the second highest in the world. Will all of them be given a blanket preference? Rolling out the vaccine in all the 30 states will not be possible. So will early supplies go to states worst-hit by the pandemic? Questions about equity and non-partisanship are inevitable. Tracking millions of doses Stitching up manufacturing contracts with vaccine makers with a \"reasonably good portfolio\" of vaccines should help India give sufficient doses to people relatively quickly, according to Prashant Yadav, who studies health care supply chains at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development. But the success at routine immunisation doesn't guarantee success with Covid-19 vaccines, he says. \"The routine immunisation infrastructure has a huge footprint, but is mostly for government-run clinics. There is no large-scale adult vaccination programme and adults don't routinely seek primary care in government public health care centres,\" says Dr Yadav. A well-regulated public-private partnership is the only way out this time, he adds. People like Ms Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of Infosys, one of India's biggest information technology services companies, suggest that India should use Aadhaar, the unique 12-digit identification number that over a billion Indians use to access welfare and pay taxes, to record and track each dose. \"We need to design a system than can do 10 million vaccinations a day across the length and breadth of the country but all unified by a digital backbone,\" Mr Nilekani told a newspaper. Fraud over access Some of the concerns are about corruption over access to vaccines. How do authorities prevent fraud such as people getting fake papers to include themselves in lists of people who are selected for early shots? And how do you prevent fake vaccines being sold in remote markets? Read more stories by Soutik Biswas Monitoring for 'adverse events' Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such \"adverse events\" following immunisation. But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak and the number of serious adverse events are still far less than the expected numbers. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines. Who will pay for it? This is possibly the biggest question. Will the government acquire all the doses and roll out a state-run free or subsidised vaccination programme? Or will the affluent pay for their doses at market prices through private distribution and sale? Experts like Dr Lahariya believe that the government should be footing the bill for vaccinating every Indian until the pandemic is over. Others like Dr Shaw say that private firms could pay to vaccinate their employees. Mr Nilekani reckons that with vaccines costing between $3 and $5 (£2.24 and £3.74) in the beginning, a dual dose vaccine could cost up to $10 for each Indian and $13bn for India. That would be very expensive. That's why, says Gagandeep Kang, a good vaccine for India should cost below 50 cents a shot, be plentifully available and delivered as a single dose.

    "text": "Only 10 member states have offered to take in refugees and even then only 12,000, it complains. The UK and Italy have offered no places at all, it adds. But the UK government says it is focusing on the region and is one of the biggest international donors. European Union aid has reached 1.3bn euros (£1.1bn; $1.7bn), officials say. The bloc says its priority is providing help to Syria's internally displaced people, now thought to number 6.5 million, and those hosted in other countries. The UN estimates almost 2.3 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries since March 2011. Most Syrians who have fled their country have travelled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. But some 6,000 this year have reached EU member state Bulgaria, which has appealed for financial help from Brussels in responding to the influx. In September, Sweden became the first EU member state to offer Syrian refugees permanent residence. More than 14,000 Syrians have sought asylum there in the past two years. Germany has resettled 1,000 refugees and plans to admit another 9,000. The UK says it has no plans to resettle or provide temporary protection to Syrian refugees, although individual asylum claims are considered on their merits. \"Instead, we are giving as much help as possible to people in the region. Our £500m pledged so far is more than the other EU member states combined,\" a spokesman told the BBC. 'Miserably failed' Earlier this month, the EU put forward plans to do more to stop migrants dying in the Mediterranean, after more than 350 people lost their lives in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October. One of the proposals involved member states making available a number of planes to enable the EU to resettle thousands more people from refugee camps. The UN has urged Western countries to take in up to 30,000 Syrians by the end of 2014. A lump sum payment of 6,000 euros would be paid to member states for each resettled refugee from the UN refugee agency's list, the Commission proposes. EU leaders will consider the package on 19 December. Amnesty International says the EU has \"miserably failed\" to provide a safe haven to Syrians, noting that 55,000 so far have been able to claim asylum. Ten countries have promised to allow in 12,000 people, it says, with 80% of the total pledges from Germany. France has offered 500 places and Spain 30, it says. The human rights group's report also criticises \"push-back\" operations aimed at halting Syrians travelling from Turkey, noting that the European Commission has provided 228m euros to bolster controls. The harsh conditions faced by Syrian refugees have been highlighted this week with the first winter snowfalls in the Bekaa valley of northern Lebanon, where tens of thousands of Syrians are sheltering in tents. A total of 838,000 Syrians have fled to Lebanon, living either in tented camps, unused buildings or with friends and family. The bitterly cold weather has also halted a UN airlift of food and other humanitarian supplies from Iraq to Kurdish areas inside north-eastern Syria. Twelve planeloads of supplies are due to be flown in, ahead of what the UN fears will be the region's harshest winter in a century.",

    "text": "Mr Ghosn, who has been detained since November, was charged with aggravated breach of trust and understating his income. He had already been indicted on a separate charge of underreporting his pay over five years. Mr Ghosn, whose detention has drawn some criticism, denies all wrongdoing. His lawyers said they would apply for bail, but experts say this request is very unlikely to be granted. The new charges will likely keep the 64-year-old in prison until his first trial, according to his lawyers. What has he been charged with? Mr Ghosn was first charged last year with underreporting his pay package for the five years to 2015. On Friday, a fresh charge claimed he understated his compensation for another three years. He was also indicted on a new, more serious charge of breach of trust. Mr Ghosn, the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, is accused of moving personal investment losses worth 1.85bn yen (£13.4m; $17m) racked up on foreign exchange dealings to Nissan. Mr Ghosn is also accused of making $14.7m in payments to Saudi businessman Khaled al-Juffali, using Nissan funds in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses. He was first detained on 19 November and rearrested twice in December. If found guilty of the financial misconduct charges, Mr Ghosn faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a fine of up to 700m yen, according to Japanese regulators. Renault audit finds 'no fraud' Following his arrest, Nissan and Mitsubishi removed Mr Ghosn as chairman. Renault has kept him on as chair, saying it has not yet found any evidence of wrongdoing. On Thursday, the board of the French firm said an investigation into executive pay had so far shown no signs of fraud. \"The review process has examined the compensation of the current Groupe Renault Executive Committee members for the financial years 2017 and 2018 and has concluded that it is both in compliance with applicable laws and free from any fraud,\" it said in a statement. It said the review process \"will continue with respect to previous financial years\". Who is Carlos Ghosn?",

    "text": "They plan to \"give birth\" to cancer in the lab to see exactly what it looks like \"on day one\". It is just one of the research priorities of the new International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection. Working together on early detection of cancer will mean patients benefitting more quickly, it says. Cancer Research UK has teamed up with the Universities of Cambridge, Manchester, University College London, and Stanford and Oregon in the US, to share ideas, technology and expertise in this area. Already there Together, the scientists are aiming to develop less invasive tests, such as blood, breath and urine tests, for monitoring high-risk patients, improve imaging techniques for detecting cancer early and look for virtually undetectable signs of the disease. But they admit this is \"like looking for a needle in a haystack\" and could be 30 years off. \"The fundamental problem is that we never get to see a cancer being born in a human being,\" says Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK. \"By the time it's found, it's already established.\" Researchers from Manchester, for example, are growing human breast tissue in the lab with synthetic immune cells to see if they can spot the very earliest, subtle changes that could lead to cancer. Prof Rob Bristow said it was akin to a \"living tissue bank outside patients\". Yet there is always the danger of over-diagnosis, because not all early cell changes turn into cancers. So the cancer researchers say they must be more precise, also looking at the genes people are born with and the environment they grow up in, to work out an individual's unique personal risk of different cancers. Only then will they know when to intervene. 'Expensive firefighting' To date, scientists say research on early detection has been small-scale and disconnected, lacking the power of trials in big populations of people. Dr Crosby said the collaboration would \"induce a sea-change in our health systems, shifting it from expensive firefighting of late-stage disease, to being able to intervene at its earliest point and deliver rapid, cost-effective treatment\". Figures show that 98% of breast cancer patients live for five years or more if the disease is diagnosed at stage 1 - the earliest stage- compared to just 26% at stage 4, the most advanced stage. But, at present, only around 44% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at the earliest stage. In the UK, screening programmes exist for breast, bowel and cervical cancers, when people reach a particular age. However, there are currently no reliable screening tools for other cancers, such as pancreas, liver, lung and prostate, which means survival rates are often much lower. Prof Mark Emberton, from UCL, said the growth of imaging, such as MRI, was a \"silent revolution\" which could replace needles, used in biopsies, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. \"Imaging only sees the aggressive cells, it overlooks the stuff you don't want to find and addresses over-diagnosis,\" he said, but he warned it was expensive and took time, and was \"not ready for prime time yet\". More accurate hyper-polarised MRI scans and photo acoustics, where laser light is delivered to the tumour, creating sound waves which are analysed to produce images, are the next advances being tested in imaging. Prof Emberton said the next goal was to see which cancers lent themselves to this type of imaging. At the University of Cambridge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald is developing an advanced endoscope to detect pre-cancerous lesions in the food pipe and colon. She said early detection hadn't been given the attention it deserved, and some tests for cancer could be very simple and inexpensive. Prof Fitzgerald said she looked forward to working with international colleagues to take ideas \"all the way from the bench to the bedside\". Cancer Research UK is investing £40m in the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection over the next five years, with $20m being contributed by Canary Center at Stanford University and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.",

    "text": "The man says he is journalist John Cantlie and that he is a prisoner. Dressed in orange, Mr Cantlie, who in 2012 escaped an earlier kidnapping in Syria, asks why he and others have been abandoned by the US and UK governments. IS has recently killed three hostages and, in a video showing the death of UK aid worker David Haines, threatened to kill British man Alan Henning next. 'Unwinnable conflict' No IS militants are seen in the video, which is entitled \"Lend Me Your Ears\" and is addressed to the Western public. In it Mr Cantlie says other European governments have negotiated for the release of their hostages but says the US and UK have done things differently. \"After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?\" he says. He also says this is the first of several of what he calls programmes in which he will explain the philosophy of IS. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said parts of it were like a \"kind of parody of a chat show\" and \"very much a propaganda video\". \"It doesn't end with any overt threat. He's reading from a script, there's no knife or gun being held to his head,\" our correspondent said. He added that previous IS videos were directed at US and UK leaders, but this was meant for the British public, particularly Muslims. The message of the video is that IS has been \"misrepresented by the Western media\", and the hostage says he is going to be revealing the truth about IS in \"the coming programmes\", our correspondent added. From comments on the tape, it is clear it was made this year, but not precisely when. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg described IS as a \"murderous, medieval, terrorist outfit\". \"We didn't need any reminding that what we're dealing with here in Isil is a movement of almost unprecedented barbarity and cynicism,\" said Mr Clegg, who has not yet seen the video. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he would \"look very closely\" at any material released on the internet. He said videos such as these could be \"very distressing\" to the families of the individuals involved. Who is John Cantlie? The video featuring Mr Cantlie has been released nearly a week after footage depicting the death of Mr Haines, the first British hostage to be killed. It was in that video that the life of Mr Henning, 47, from Salford, was threatened. Mr Henning was a volunteer on an aid convoy in December 2013 when he was seized just after crossing into Syria. Earlier, British Muslim leaders called for his immediate release, saying anyone undertaking a humanitarian act should be held in the highest esteem. The video of Mr Haines's death followed the killings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - which were also shown in videos - in August and earlier this month respectively. On Tuesday, IS released a separate video, which was described by analysts as a video response to US air strikes. The slickly produced, Hollywood-style trailer for a film entitled \"Flames of War\" refers to US President Barack Obama's insistence that US combat troops would not be returning to fight in Iraq. In an apparent taunt, it depicts wounded US troops, masked executioners standing over kneeling captives, and declares at the conclusion: \"Fighting has just begun.\"",

    "text": "By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter The most newsy feature is its new App Tracking Transparency function - which means users will have to \"opt in\" if they want their online activity tracked by companies. Here are the things that caught our eye. Unlocking an iPhone wearing a mask Apple's new operating system will allow you to unlock your phone whilst wearing a mask - with a gigantic catch. Apple's facial recognition doesn't generally work when users are wearing a mask. Apple's work-around involves you also owning an Apple Watch. Apple said: \"With Apple Watch on the wrist, unlocked, and in close proximity to iPhone, users can simply glance at their iPhone and they will receive haptic feedback from Apple Watch, indicating their iPhone has been unlocked.\" For anyone who doesn't own an Apple Watch, as well as an iPhone, this feature won't work. App Tracking Transparency The new update will mean a prompt will flash up when you want to download an app - asking for your permission for the app to track your online activity. That data is currently used to create highly targeted ads based on your online behaviour by companies like Facebook. Facebook has publically lobbied against the new change. The less Facebook knows about you, the less money it can charge for adverts. Apple's motives for the move have been questioned. If app developers can't make as much through advertising, they might be more inclined to charge for services - and Apple makes money from these payments. You can read more about this update here. Like millions of iPhone users I downloaded iOS 14.5 last night and waited to find out what Apple's brave new world of freedom from tracking looked like. But nothing happened. There were no alerts from the hundreds of apps I have installed, asking me to agree to tracking. I tried downloading some new apps, but again: nothing, nada, zilch. Buried in the privacy section of the phone's settings is a switch labelled \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" which was toggled on. Underneath, just one app was listed - a streaming service which I think I updated last night. It seems that even if that is switched on, tracking stays off until the apps themselves push out a request screen inviting you to accept it. Facebook says it is in the process of pushing out its screen - preceded by another one, explaining why tracking is a good thing and has helped to keep many small businesses afloat. But a huge system of data collection, which sees app users tracked wherever they go, has been switched off for all who download the update. What's not clear is how much of it will be switched on again - by users, or even by the developers themselves. Many may decide that this kind of tracking has had its day, and they need to find a new model for advertising. New Emojis Apple has introduced several new emojis in its latest update. For example, people will be able to select different skin tones for the \"couple kissing\" emoji and \"couple with heart\" emoji. Apple said that \"Additional emoji include characters for face exhaling, face with spiral eyes, face in clouds, hearts on fire, mending heart, and woman with a beard, among others.\" Siri Apple says Siri, its voice-controlled assistant, is becoming more diverse. \"Siri no longer has a default voice, allowing users to choose the voice that speaks to them when they first set up their device,\" says Apple. \"In English, users can now select more diverse voice options. These new Siri voices use Neural Text to Speech technology for an incredibly natural sound,\" says Apple. Apple says these updates represent longstanding commitments to diversity and inclusion. However many of Apple's devices are made in China, where Apple has received criticism for not being more vocal about the government's treatment of Uyghurs. Apple's critics say that the company should be consistent in its messaging on diversity - both at home and abroad. AirTags Apple's new operating system will work with the newly launched \"AirTags\". The small disc can be attached to things like your keys or wallet. If you lose them, you'll be able to track them with the Find My app. This looks very similar to another product on the market: \"Tile\". Last week Apple was criticised during a Senate hearing for copying Tile's idea. Tile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said \"We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair.\" She also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage. Apple said the product was different. \"We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,\" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer.

    "text": "By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The 25-year-old needed hospital treatment after his lungs could not get enough oxygen into his body. Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. \"Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection,\" said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. \"The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity.\" He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was \"very concerning\" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. \"Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. \"It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection.\" Follow James on Twitter",

    "text": "Prince Andrew, 59, said he had asked the Queen for permission to withdraw for the \"foreseeable future\". He said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who \"wants some form of closure\". The duke has faced a growing backlash following a BBC interview about his friendship with the US financier. Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. For several months the duke had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. His latest move, described by Buckingham Palace as \"a personal decision\", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. In a statement, the duke said: \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. \"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. \"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.\" He added that he was \"willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required\". BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said his latest statement was \"completely different in tone\" to his recent TV interview and had \"addressed all the issues that he'd been criticised for\", including offering sympathy to Epstein's victims. She described his decision to step back as a \"drastic\" move but said \"the rumours that had been circulating had been really difficult for the Royal Family to manage\". In his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said the \"opportunities I was given to learn\" about business meant he did not regret the friendship with Epstein, although he said meeting him for a final time in 2010 was \"the wrong decision\". The duke said he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, and said that on the night she claims they first met that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was \"profusely sweating\" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. He said he had met Epstein \"through his girlfriend back in 1999\" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. Since the interview, a letter written in 2011 to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has emerged, saying they met in the early 1990s. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is \"for the foreseeable future\". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Roberts Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter told the BBC News Channel that the prince's position had become \"untenable\" and the only surprise was that it took so long, adding \"there was no other direction he could go\". However, he said the prince was \"not out of the woods yet\" as the FBI and lawyers for some of Epstein's alleged victims wanted to talk to him under oath. Lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Epstein's victims, told BBC Newsnight that she was \"very glad\" the prince had indicated he was willing to speak to law enforcement, but said she didn't know why he had added \"if required\" to his statement. She said he should volunteer to cooperate \"without any condition and without any more delay\". The duke's website says he carries out official duties for the Queen, focusing on promoting economic growth and skilled job creation. Over the past two months he has carried out overseas engagements in Australia, United Arab Emirates and Thailand. The prince's announcement means he won't be carrying out public engagements, but he will still attend Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday. Duke ties cut BT became the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew \"in light of recent developments\". In a statement, the firm said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but \"our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York\". \"We are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,\" a spokeswoman said. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG also announced they were withdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiative Pitch@Palace. Sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, the Sun newspaper reported. Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen on BBC iPlayer in the UK. The full interview can also be seen on YouTube.",

It then asked diners to enter their measurements into an app that would then suggest menu items accordingly. Signs reading \"be thrifty and diligent, promote empty plates\" and \"operation empty plate\" were pinned up. The policy caused uproar on Chinese social media. Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on the social platform Weibo. The restaurant said it was \"deeply sorry\" for its interpretation of the national \"Clean Plate Campaign\". \"Our original intentions were to advocate stopping waste and ordering food in a healthy way. We never forced customers to weigh themselves,\" it said in an apology posted online. President Xi Jinping ignited the campaign this week, calling the levels of national food wastage \"shocking and distressing\".

He rejected speculations that he had resigned because of pressure from the government or his ill health. Mr Geelani has spearheaded political protests against Indian rule in the disputed Kashmir region since 1989. He added that he would continue to \"lead his people\" against India. Mr Geelani said he was unable to reach other leaders of the group to discuss his decision. \"Despite my ill health and continued restrictions, I tried to approach you through various ways but none of you were available. Now that you feel that you will be held accountable for the misappropriation of funds, you openly revolted against the leadership,\" Mr Geelani said in his letter.

Mr Geelani has been a central figure in political protests against Indian rule in Kashmir for decades. He was a legislator for over 15 years before resigning in 1989 to join anti-India protests. He played a prominent role in bringing several political and religious groups under the banner of All Parties Hurriyat Conference in 1993. He was later elected as the group's chairman. Mr Geelani is known for his strong opposition to holding any kind of dialogue with India. He has always demanded that a plebiscite on whether Kashmir should remain under Indian rule should be held before any talks can take place. This often brought him in conflict with his younger colleagues, who were more open to holding talks with Indian leaders.",

    "text": "An official source told the BBC Mr Dhar was the focus of investigations into the video, which purports to show the killing of five men IS says were spies. \"A lot of people think it is him,\" the source said, although there has been no official confirmation. Mr Dhar, also known as Abu Rumaysah, fled Britain in 2014 while on bail. The father-of-four, from Walthamstow in east London, had been arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, but later travelled to Syria. The UK's security authorities are facing mounting questions over how he was able to flee the UK while on bail, one of the conditions of which was that he must hand over his passport. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham described it as a \"serious lapse in security\" and called for an inquiry. He has been granted an urgent question in the Commons later on Tuesday about how Mr Dhar managed to flee the UK. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said a separate investigation was unlikely but the issues would form part of his committee's counter-terrorism inquiry. 'Benefit of hindsight' David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of anti-terror legislation, said Mr Dhar had been arrested under standard police procedures, rather than anti-terror laws, which would have meant no bail but would have allowed the police less time to make a decision on charges. \"Where it seems to have broken down is not ensuring the passport was handed over. With the great benefit of hindsight, it is easy to think that a police officer should have accompanied this person to his home and ensured it was handed over to him them,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. \"Secondly, (there is the question of) why the fact that this person was effectively banned from leaving the country was not picked up at an exit check.\" Police powers By BBC home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani Police bail someone they have arrested if they have insufficient evidence to charge but they still want to continue the investigation. Conditions imposed on that bail, such as bans on meeting witnesses, are designed to protect the integrity of that ongoing probe. There is no general power to hold someone under a form of house arrest pending further investigation - although the former control order system for some terrorism suspects came close. Even if the police and MI5 had decided to subject Mr Dhar to monitoring under the successor \"TPim\" system of controls, history has shown that they have not stopped people fleeing the UK. So it's in that context that you could argue that Mr Dhar saw - and seized - a window of opportunity in the legal process. Released because there was insufficient evidence of a crime, he decided to get out of the UK before he could be stopped. Who is Siddhartha Dhar? Mr Anderson played down suggestions that security agencies should have been monitoring Mr Dhar. \"There are thousands of people who are subjects of interest. I don't know how high up the list this person was - I suspect not very near the top,\" he added. Former Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahy, who previously led on counter-terrorism for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said it was \"incredibly difficult\" to monitor somebody 24 hours a day. Security services have now completed an \"initial assessment\" of the identity of the masked man in the video, Downing Street said, adding work was \"ongoing\" to study the clip. \"I don't expect us to confirm our assessment of who this individual is at any stage in the process,\" a spokeswoman said. Born a Hindu, Mr Dhar ran a business renting out bouncy castles in London before converting to Islam and joining the radical group al-Muhajiroun. Mr Dhar's sister told the BBC that when she first heard the audio of the video she feared it was her brother, although having watched a clip she was now not so sure. \"I was in a state of shock,\" said Konika Dhar. \"I believed the audio to resemble, from what I remember, the voice of my brother but having viewed the short clip in detail, I wasn't entirely convinced which put me at ease\". Documentary maker Robb Leech, who has met Mr Dhar, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"surprising\" to \"see what looks like him in the video\". \"I've seen the video, it certainly sounds like him,\" he said. In the latest video by the extremist group - which has not been independently verified - the masked man, who is holding a gun, mocks Prime Minister David Cameron for daring to \"challenge the might\" of the extremist group. Five men, wearing jumpsuits and kneeling in a desert location, appear to be shot in the back of the head, after making what is claimed to be their confessions. IS says they were spying for the UK. The 10-minute video also features a boy with a British accent. After the apparent killings, he is seen pointing into the distance and talking about killing \"unbelievers\". 'Used as as shield' Channel 4 News has reported that a south London man they named as Sunday Dare recognised the boy in the video as his grandson, who was taken to Syria by his daughter Grace Dare. He said he was being used \"as a shield\", adding his daughter \"should come back and face the music because she has let herself down\". Grace Dare, who also goes by the name Khadijah, comes from a British-Nigerian background and converted to Islam when she was 18. She travelled to Syria in 2013, aged 22. At least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, British police say. About half have since returned to Britain. The IS group seized large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, when it formally declared the establishment of a \"caliphate\" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia. IS has previously released propaganda videos of killings, including footage showing the apparent beheading of two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.",

Residents have had to stand in line for hours to get water from government tanks, and restaurants have closed due to the lack of water. \"Only rain can save Chennai from this situation,\" an official told BBC Tamil. The city, which, according to the 2011 census, is India's sixth largest, has been in the grip of a severe water shortage for weeks now. As the reservoirs started to run dry, many hotels and restaurants shut down temporarily. The Chennai metro has turned off air conditioning in the stations, while offices have asked staff to work from home in a bid to conserve water. Vinoth Kaligai, the general secretary of an IT workers' association, confirmed that some firms had told employees to stay at home. \"But homes are also running out of water, so what are we supposed to do?\" he added. The situation has also prompted clashes to break out between residents. Last week, police arrested a man for stabbing his neighbour during a fight over water-sharing in the neighbourhood. Officials are trying to find alternative sources of water, with the city's water department starting to identify and extract water from quarries. But the big concern is the dry reservoirs and low groundwater levels. \"The only way to make this better is to improve the groundwater level,\" Nakkeeran, a social activist, said. \"We've had dry years before but the groundwater was our saviour.\" The water crisis has also meant that most of the city has to depend solely on Chennai's water department, which has been distributing water through government trucks across neighbourhoods. \"The destruction has just begun,\" an official said. \"If the rain fails us this year too, we are totally destroyed.\"",

    "text": "The Pakistani national's plea for mercy to Indian President Pranab Mukherjee was rejected earlier this month. He was executed in prison in Pune early on Wednesday, the Home Ministry said. The 60-hour siege of Mumbai began on 26 November 2008. Attacks on the railway station, luxury hotels and a Jewish cultural centre claimed 166 lives. Nine gunmen were also killed. Qasab and an accomplice carried out the assault on the main railway station, killing 52 people. He was convicted of murder and other crimes in May 2010. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence in August. 'Need for secrecy' R R Patil, Home Minister of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, said Qasab was hanged in the Yerawada prison at 0730 (0200 GMT). \"This is a tribute to all innocent people and police officers who lost their lives in this heinous attack on our nation,\" Mr Patil was quoted as telling reporters by the Associated Press news agency. Qasab did not leave behind a will and was buried inside the jail, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said. Senior officials in Delhi said Qasab's family members had been informed about the execution \"through a letter sent by courier\". In Delhi, federal Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said he had signed Qasab's execution order on 7 November, two days after President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his clemency petition. Qasab, who had been held in Mumbai's Arthur Road jail, was moved to Pune's Yerawada prison two days ago, Prithviraj Chavan said. \"We kept secrecy. It was important to maintain secrecy in this matter,\" Mr Shinde said, adding that Pakistan had been informed of the execution. The Indian government was under pressure to act against a man who helped carry out one of the deadliest attacks in the country, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi. But the swiftness and secrecy in which the execution took place would have come as a surprise to many, our correspondent adds. Major political parties in India welcomed Qasab's execution. A spokesman for the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said the execution would send a message to India's enemies. \"The hanging of Qasab is a case of better late than never. It also sends out a strong message and warning to India's enemies and to forces across the border that are running factories of terrorism,\" he said. Commenting on Qasab's execution, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Moazzam Ali Khan said: \"We condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestation... We are willing to co-operate and work closely with all countries of the region to eliminate the scourge of terrorism.\" But Pakistan-based banned militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba [LeT], which was blamed for the Mumbai attacks, hailed Qasab as a \"hero\". He would \"inspire other fighters to follow his path\", an unnamed LeT commander was quoted by Reuters as saying. The Pakistani Taliban were \"shocked\" by the hanging, Reuters quoted Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan as saying. Faridkot, the village Qasab came from in the Pakistani province of Punjab, was tense on Wednesday. Villagers who BBC Urdu spoke to denied he had ever lived there. Other reports said residents were openly hostile and threw stones at journalists. 'Help me get out of jail' There has been no information yet on Qasab's last few days, but his lawyer Raju Ramachandran, who argued his case in the Supreme Court, told Reuters that Qasab was a \"worried man\" when he last met him in August, before the court upheld his death sentence. He was scared that he would be hanged and asked the lawyer: \"Can you please help me get out of jail?\" Qasab was part of a heavily armed and well-drilled, 10-member militant unit which arrived in Mumbai by sea on 26 November. The men split into groups to attack various targets. Their assault on the Taj Mahal Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel and a Jewish centre went on for more than two days. Closed-circuit TV camera showed Qasab and an accomplice opening fire on passengers at one of Mumbai's busiest train stations, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Relations between India and Pakistan deteriorated sharply after India blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attacks. After initial denials, Pakistan acknowledged that the assault had been partially planned on its territory and that Qasab was a Pakistani citizen. Relations have been gradually improving since then. Qasab's execution was the first in India since a man convicted of raping and killing a schoolgirl was hanged in the eastern city of Calcutta in 2004.",

    "text": "Hugh PymHealth editor@bbcHughPymon Twitter The McKinsey Global Institute said it cost £1.3tn, or 2.8% of annual economic activity - it cost the UK £47bn. Some 2.1bn people - about 30% of the world's population - were overweight or obese, the researchers added. They said measures that relied less on individual responsibility should be used to tackle the problem. Lost output The report said there was a \"steep economic toll\", and the proportion could rise to almost half of the world's population by 2030. The financial costs of obesity are growing - for health care and more widely in the economy. By causing illness, obesity results in working days and output lost. The researchers argued that a range of ambitious policies needed to be considered and a systemic rather than piecemeal response was essential. What is obesity? A person is considered obese if they are very overweight with a high degree of body fat. The most common way to assess if a person is obese is to check their body mass index (BMI), which divides your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. If your BMI is above 25 you are overweight. A BMI of 30-40 is considered obese, while above 40 is very obese. A BMI of less than 18.5 is underweight. Where are you on the global BMI scale? \"These initiatives would need to draw on interventions that rely less on individual responsibility and more on changes to the environment,\" the report said. If the right measures were taken there could be long-term savings of £760m a year for the UK's National Health Service, it added. The initiatives assessed in the report include portion control for some packaged food and the reformulation of fast and processed food. 'Crisis proportions' It said these were more effective than taxes on high-fat and high-sugar products or public health campaigns. Weight management programmes and workplace fitness schemes were also considered. The report concluded that \"a strategy of sufficient scale is needed as obesity is now reaching crisis proportions\". The rising prevalence of obesity was driving the increase in heart and lung disease, diabetes and lifestyle-related cancers, it said. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England (PHE), said: \"The report is a useful contribution to the obesity debate. PHE has consistently said that simple education messages alone are not enough to tackle obesity.\" Dr Tedstone said obesity required action across national and local government, industry and society as a whole, and there was \"no single silver bullet solution\". The report was produced by McKinsey Global Institute, the business and economics research arm of consultancy firm McKinsey & Company.",

    "text": "The recording is being verified by the US National Weather Service. It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. \"It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face,\" Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. \"When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers,\" she said. \"You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you.\" What were the previous records? Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had \"serious credibility issues\". What about the heatwave? The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large \"firenado\" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning \"when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply\". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. What are the effects of extreme heat? Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.",

Mr Roy's family said he had been threatened by Mr Farabi on Twitter and Facebook, Maj Alam said. \"[Roy's] family told us that he got threats from Farabi several times,\" he told AFP news agency. Police accuse Mr Farabi of involvement with the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned in Bangladesh. On Sunday, the Bangladeshi government accepted a US offer of FBI help to assist in the murder inquiry. Wife in hospital Avijit Roy was attacked last Thursday evening by men wielding machetes as he returned from a book fair in Dhaka, his native city. His wife Rafida Ahmed also suffered head injuries and lost a finger in the attack and remains in hospital in a serious condition. Mourners gathered on Sunday in Dhaka to pay their respects to Mr Roy. \"Free thinking in Bangladesh is becoming a great danger,\" Reuters quoted writer Shahriar Kabir as saying. \"We want to know why the government failed to ensure the safety of him, despite knowing that he had been facing threats from the Islamist radicals.\" Farabi Shafiur Rahman is currently on bail in a second case, having been previously arrested over online postings following the murder of another anti-extremism blogger, Ahmed Rajib Haider, in 2013. Ahmed Rajib Haider was among a group of bloggers who had called for the execution of Islamist leaders for crimes committed in Bangladesh's 1971 independence war.

    "text": "Lee created The Fantastic Four for Marvel Comics in 1961 and went on to create titles including Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk. Actor Chris Evans, best known for playing Marvel's Captain America, wrote \"there will never be another Stan Lee\". X-Men star Hugh Jackman said \"we've lost a creative genius.\" Robert Downey Jr, who played Iron Man, simply wrote: \"I owe it all to you, Rest in Peace Stan.\" Kevin Feige, the producer and president of Marvel Studios, tweeted: \"No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee.\" The legendary comic book author died at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to a family lawyer. Tom Hardy, who stars in Venom, the latest film based on a Marvel Comics character, shared a photo of Lee on set, via Instagram. Sir Patrick Stewart told Radio 4's Today programme he had met Lee \"numerous times\". \"He loved to visit the set and he became famous, like Hitchcock, for appearing in his movies,\" said the actor, who played Professor X in the X-Men series. \"He created flawed heroes and it was one of the things that made X-Men so interesting for all of us who worked on them,\" he continued. \"We were always very much aware that no matter what our superpowers were, we were human beings, we could make mistakes and things could go wrong. It was that quality which gave humanity to all of Stan's work.\" Evangeline Lilly, who portrayed Ant Man's superhero partner, the Wasp, shared a tribute on Twitter. And Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds posted: \"Damn... RIP Stan. Thanks for everything.\" Tom Holland, who is Marvel's latest Spider-Man, wrote that he \"was indebted\" to Lee. Other stars to pay tribute include Angela Bassett, Zoe Saldana, Jamie Chung, Josh Groban, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Pratt and Josh Brolin. Shane Duffy, CEO of Lee's Pow! Entertainment, praised the \"father of pop culture\" for inventing \"universes of characters\". He was, Duffy continued, \"a true iconic pioneer with no comparable second.\" The Walt Disney Company, which bought Marvel Entertainment in 2009, lauded Lee's \"unmatchable\" life and career in a statement. \"Every time you open a Marvel comic, Stan will be there,\" it said. \"Please join us today in remembering Stan 'The Man' Lee.\" Rival publisher DC Comics also tweeted a tribute. Broadcaster Jonathan Ross remembered Lee as \"an incredible showman\" who had \"touched so many millions with his work\". \"He was also a very warm, very kind and very nice human being,\" Ross told BBC Breakfast. Lee's wife, Joan, died in 2017, also aged 95. He is survived by his daughter, JC Lee. Speaking to celebrity news website TMZ, JC Lee said her father was \"the greatest, most decent man\". She told Reuters: \"He felt an obligation to his fans to keep creating.\" In recent years Lee had periodically suffered from illnesses, including a bout of pneumonia. He was known for making a cameo in almost every Marvel film. Despite leaving the Marvel company in 1972, he remained chairman emeritus. On Sunday - Veterans Day - his official Facebook page shared a photograph of Lee in the Army, noting that his official title during World War II was Playwright. Who was Stan Lee? Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18. For years Lee wrote only simple comics, focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns and aimed at young readers. Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong. In 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began. Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic. Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right. In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.",

    "text": "By Megha MohanGender and identity reporter The nurse stopped at the doorway leading out of Rose's hospital room and turned to face her. \"I'm sorry this happened to you,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"My daughter was raped too.\" Rose looked at the nurse. She couldn't be older than 40, Rose thought, her daughter must be young, like me. She thought back to the morning after the assault, to the conversations with the emotionless policeman and the clinical doctor. Everyone had used the phrase \"alleged\" when referring to the violent, hours-long overnight attack that Rose had described to them. With the exception of her father and grandmother, most of her relatives hadn't believed her either. With the nurse it was different. \"She believed me,\" Rose says. It was a small crack of hope - someone recognising and acknowledging what had happened to her. A wave of relief washed over her, which felt like it could be the start of her recovery. But soon hundreds of thousands of people would see the rape for themselves and from those viewers she received no sympathy. A decade later, Rose Kalemba brushes her thick thigh-length black hair at the bathroom mirror, twirling the ends with her fingers to form natural ringlets. This wouldn't have been the case in the months after her attack - all the mirrors in her home had to be covered with blankets, as she couldn't bear to catch her reflection. She is now 25 and she has organised routines of self-care into her daily life. Taking care of her hair is one. Combing it takes time and effort, it's almost an act of meditation. She knows she has beautiful hair, people comment on it all the time. Every morning she also makes herself a cup of cacao, a pure, raw form of chocolate that she believes has healing qualities, and writes down her goals in a diary. She deliberately puts them in the present tense. \"I'm an excellent driver,\" is one goal. \"I'm happily married to Robert,\" is another. \"I'm a great mother.\" Sitting down to talk, Rose pulls her hair over her shoulders - it covers most of her body, her own armour. Growing up in a small town in Ohio, it wasn't unusual for Rose to go for a walk alone before bedtime. It cleared her head, she enjoyed the fresh air and peace. So that evening in summer 2009 started like most for 14-year-old Rose. But then a man appeared from the shadows. At knifepoint he forced her into a car. Sitting in the passenger seat was a second man, aged about 19 - she'd seen him around town. They drove her to a house on the other side of town and raped her over a period of 12 hours, while a third man filmed parts of the assault. Rose was in shock - she could hardly breathe. She was badly beaten and stabbed on her left leg, her clothes bloody. She fell in and out of consciousness. At some point, one of the men got out a laptop and showed Rose videos of attacks on other women. \"I am of first nations ethnicity,\" she says. \"The attackers were white and the power structure was clear. Some of the victims were white but many were women of colour.\" Later, the men threatened to kill her. Forcing herself to collect her senses, Rose began to talk to them. If they released her, she wouldn't reveal their identities, she said. Nothing would ever happen to them, no-one would know. Taking her back in the car, men dumped her in a street about half an hour's walk from her home. Walking through the door, she caught sight of her reflection in the hall mirror. A gash in her head was oozing blood. Her father, Ron, and some extended family were in the living room about to have lunch. Still bleeding from her stab wound, she explained what had happened to her. \"My dad called the police, he immediately comforted me, but the others said I had asked for it by walking out late at night,\" Rose says. At the hospital, Rose was greeted by a male doctor and male police officer. \"They both dealt with me in an extremely matter-of-fact manner,\" she adds, \"There was no kindness, no warmth.\" The male police officer asked her if this had started as consensual. Was it a night gone wild, he wondered. Rose was stunned. \"Here I was beaten beyond recognition. Stabbed and bleeding...\" Rose told them no, it had not been consensual. And still reeling from what she had been through, she said she didn't know who had attacked her. The police had no leads to go on. When Rose was released the next day, she attempted suicide, unable to imagine how she could possibly live a normal life now. Her brother found her in time. A few months later, Rose was browsing MySpace when she found several people from her school sharing a link. She was tagged. Clicking on it, Rose was directed to the pornography-sharing site, Pornhub. She felt a wave of nausea as she saw several videos of the attack on her. \"The titles of the videos were 'teen crying and getting slapped around', 'teen getting destroyed', 'passed out teen'. One had over 400,000 views,\" Rose recounts. \"The worst videos were the ones where I was passed out. Seeing myself being attacked where I wasn't even conscious was the worst.\" She made an instant decision to not tell her family about the videos - most of them had not been supportive anyway. Telling them would achieve nothing. Within days it was evident that most of her peers at school had seen the videos. \"I was bullied,\" she says, \"People would say that I asked for it. That I led men on. That I was a slut.\" Some boys said their parents had told them to stay away from her, in case she seduced them and then accused them of rape. \"People have an easier time blaming the victim,\" she says. Rose says she emailed Pornhub several times over a period of six months in 2009 to ask for the videos to be taken down. \"I sent Pornhub begging emails. I pleaded with them. I wrote, 'Please, I'm a minor, this was assault, please take it down.'\" She received no reply and the videos remained live. \"The year that followed I withdrew into myself. I disassociated,\" she recalls, \"I felt nothing. Numb. I kept to myself.\" She would wonder, with every stranger who made eye contact with her, if they had seen the videos. \"Had they got off to it? Had they gratified themselves to my rape?\" She couldn't bear to look at herself. That's why she covered the mirrors with blankets. She would brush her teeth and wash in the dark, thinking all the time about who could be watching the videos. Then she had an idea. She set up a new email address posing as a lawyer, and sent Pornhub an email threatening legal action. \"Within 48 hours the videos disappeared.\" Months later Rose began to receive counselling, finally revealing the identity of her attackers to the psychologist, who was duty bound to report them to the police. But she didn't tell her family or the police about the videos. The police collected victim impact statements from Rose and her family. The attackers' lawyers argued that Rose had consented to sex, and the men were charged not with rape but \"contributions towards the delinquency of a minor\" - a misdemeanour - and received a suspended sentence. Rose and her family did not have the energy, or the resources, to fight for a tougher sentence. It's clear that Ron Kalemba thinks a lot about what happened to his daughter all those years ago. What could he have done differently, if he'd known more, he wonders. His daughter changed after the assault. She went from being a straight-A student to missing classes, rarely handing in her homework. We're sitting in a park near his home that Ron visits often. He and Rose sometimes read from passages of the Bible from a picnic bench together. They don't talk much about the past. \"It feels like the whole world let her down,\" he says. \"Her abuse, it was like it was a big joke to everyone. It changed her life completely, and people let her down every step of the way.\" Ron only heard about the Pornhub videos in 2019, when a blog that Rose shared about her abuse went viral on social media. He had no idea that his daughter's rape had been seen by so many people, nor that people in her school had mocked her for it. \"I knew a girl in eighth grade when I was in school,\" Ron recalls. \"People would pick on her, and she would get beaten up. And none of us would say anything, we just watched it happen.\" \"I ran into her years later and she thought that I was a bully too, because I had just stood by and watched it happen. In reality it had only been a couple of people who actually hurt her but she thought we were all against her because we watched it and said nothing. That's what the silence felt like to her.\" Is this what he thinks happened to Rose? \"Yes but it was worse for her. She had a digital crowd of bullies too. Some silent and some abusive. Hers is a different world.\" Over the next few years Rose would often disappear into the digital world. She threw herself into writing, expressing herself on blogs and social media, sometimes using aliases, sometimes her real name. One day in 2019, as she was scrolling through her social media feed she saw a number of posts about Pornhub. People were praising it for donating to bee conservation charities, adding caption facilities for deaf viewers, donating to aid domestic violence charities and providing $25,000 scholarships for women who want to enter the tech industry. According to Pornhub, there were 42 billion visits to its website in 2019 - an increase of 8.5 billion from the year before, with a daily average of around 115 million. And 1,200 searches per second. \"It's impossible to miss Pornhub if you use social media,\" says Rose. \"They've done a great job at positioning themselves as a 'woke' mission, almost transcending porn, but videos titled like mine are still on the site. There's no way of knowing if there are rapes on there and the victims don't know it.\" In the viral blog post, Rose shared a detailed account of her rape, and called out Pornhub for turning a blind eye until she pretended to be a lawyer. Dozens of women and some men responded to her post, saying that videos showing them being sexually abused had also appeared on the site. In a statement to the BBC, Pornhub said: \"These horrific allegations date back to 2009, several years prior to Pornhub being acquired by its current owners, so we do not have information on how it was handled at that time. Since the change in ownership, Pornhub has continuously put in place the industry's most stringent safeguards and policies when it comes to combating unauthorised and illegal content, as part of our commitment to combating child sex abuse material. The company employs Vobile, a state-of-the-art third party fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform.\" When asked why videos with titles similar to those uploaded featuring Rose's rape, such as \"teen abused while sleeping\", \"drunk teen abuse sleeping\" and \"extreme teen abuse\" are still active on Pornhub, the company said: \"We allow all forms of sexual expression that follow our Terms of Use, and while some people may find these fantasies inappropriate, they do appeal to many people around the world and are protected by various freedom of speech laws.\" Pornhub introduced a \"non-consensual content removal system\" in 2015, but stories about videos of abuse on the website continue to surface. In October last year a 30-year-old Florida man, Christopher Johnson, faced charges for sexually abusing a 15-year-old. Videos of the attack had been posted on Pornhub. In a statement to the BBC regarding this case, Pornhub said its policy is to \"remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case\". In 2019 Pornhub also removed a channel called Girls Do Porn, when 22 women sued it for forcing them to take part in videos, and the channel's owners were charged with sex trafficking. \"People may say that what happened to me a decade ago isn't a reality of today, but that is simply not the case,\" says Rose. \"Women have told me that it is still happening, after they saw my blog. And these are Western women with access to social media. \"I don't doubt that videos in other parts of the world, in places we know porn is consumed in large bulks like the Middle East and Asia are places where the victim might not even be aware that their abuse is being shared.\" The BBC also spoke to one woman who emailed Rose. A video showing her being abused remained for years on a smaller site, even though she sent several emails to the company, and left a post in the comments section under the video. The woman, from California, says that the video has also been downloaded and shared on other porn sites. Lawyers for the website told the BBC that their clients had \"no knowledge of any such situation\". The BBC then provided a link to the video, as well as screenshots of comments by the woman requesting for it to be removed. It was finally removed in the following days. \"What happened to Rose in 2009 is still happening today on several free streaming porn sites - and not just Pornhub,\" says Kate Isaacs from Not Your Porn, a group that investigates porn sites. \"There's nothing we can do about rogue, smaller porn sites set up by individuals but large commercial sites like Pornhub need to be held accountable and they are not right now. No laws apply to them.\" So-called revenge pornography, which is a type of image-based sexual abuse, has been a criminal offence in England and Wales since 2015. The law defines it as \"the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person, without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress\". It is punishable by up to two years' imprisonment. However platforms that share this content have not been held accountable so far. \"Porn sites are aware that there is disturbing and non-consensual content on their platforms,\" says Isaacs. \"They know that there is no way we can differentiate fantasy role-play acting, or faked production scenarios, or real abuse.\" She set up Not Your Porn when a sex video featuring a friend of hers (who was under 16 at the time) was uploaded on to Pornhub. Kate says more than 50 women in the UK have come to her in the past six months to say that sexual videos have been posted without their consent on pornography sites. Thirty of them were uploaded to Pornhub. She also points out that Pornhub and other websites enable viewers to download videos on to their own computer - so even if the video is taken down from one website it's easy for any of these users to share it or upload it again to another. Not Your Porn are campaigning for laws in that UK that would make the sharing of non-consensual pornographic videos a criminal offence. Rose has hope for the future. In her early 20s she met her boyfriend, Robert, who she says has helped her discuss and come to terms with her abuse. She hopes they'll get married and have a daughter. And her dog Bella, a pitbull is a source of strength. \"I've grown up around pitbulls. They may have a reputation of being aggressive but they're so sweet,\" she says. \"They're aggressive only if abused by humans,\" she adds pointedly. \"In many ways, I have a life sentence,\" Rose say. \"Even now I could be at the grocery store and I wonder if a stranger has seen my video.\" But she no longer wants to be silent, she says. \"The most powerful weapon of a rapist is our silence.\" You may also be interested in: Purnima Shil was gang-raped in northern Bangladesh at the age of 13 and she has not been allowed to forget it.

    "text": "Horst Seehofer has long been a vocal critic of Mrs Merkel's refugee policies but has now taken up a key role at the heart of her new coalition. His comments are seen as an effort to win back voters from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The chancellor was quick to distance herself from the remarks. In his interview with the mass-circulation Bild newspaper, Mr Seehofer said Germany had been \"shaped by Christianity\", and that the country should not give up its own traditions. \"No. Islam does not belong to Germany. Germany is shaped by Christianity,\" he said. \"The Muslims who live among us naturally belong to Germany... That of course does not mean that we should, out of a false consideration for others, give up our traditions and customs. \"Muslims need to live with us, not next to us or against us.\" Mr Seehofer, who heads Mrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party the CSU, also vowed to increase deportations of rejected asylum-seekers. The chancellor made plain in 2015, amid a rise in anti-immigration protests, that she believed Islam was part of Germany, echoing the words of former president Christian Wulff. On Friday she emphasised the need for coexistence between religions. \"Our country is heavily influenced by Christianity - and a Jewish influence - but in the meantime four million Muslims are living in Germany and they also practise their religion here and these Muslims also belong to Germany and so their religion, Islam, also belongs to Germany,\" she said. Divisions exposed Analysis by Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent Horst Seehofer has fashioned himself for a unique role in German politics - that of thorn in Angela Merkel's side. As leader of the CSU he was a frequent and vociferous critic of the chancellor, particularly over her asylum policy. He may now be in her cabinet - a controversial appointment made in return for CSU support for the hard-won coalition with the SPD - but Mr Seehofer is still up for a fight, directly opposing the chancellor, who has publicly stated that Islam does belong to Germany. This is, in part, about chasing the far-right AfD. Mr Seehofer has an eye on his beloved Bavaria - there are regional elections there later this year and the AfD has made gains in the state. But his comments, which come just days after several attacks on Muslim institutions, have outraged many and represent a bad start for Mrs Merkel's new government. Mr Seehofer has highlighted divisions within her coalition and he risks playing right into the hands of the AfD, the largest opposition party, who would like nothing better than to establish immigration as the central theme of this parliament. More than one million migrants arrived in Germany after Mrs Merkel opened the doors to Syrian asylum seekers in 2015. The backlash sparked by her policy helped fuel the country's far right in last year's election - the AfD entered the federal parliament for the first time - and led to the worst electoral performance in almost 70 years for her CDU party. After Germany's longest post-war period of coalition-building, Mrs Merkel was sworn in for a fourth term as chancellor on Wednesday. Under the coalition deal, the CDU-CSU conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to limit migration.",

    "text": "By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent It is the presence of formaldehyde - a colourless gas that is naturally released by vegetation but also from a number of polluting activities. The elevated concentrations have been observed by Europe's new Sentinel-5P satellite, which was launched last October to track air quality worldwide. It is information that will inform policies to clean up the atmosphere. Compared to the major constituents like nitrogen and oxygen, the formaldehyde signal is actually very small; in every billion air molecules just a few will be HCHO. But it can be a signifier of more general pollution problems, says Isabelle De Smedt from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB). \"The formaldehyde column is composed of different sorts of volatile organic compounds, and the source can be from vegetation - so, from natural origin - but also from fires and pollution,\" she told BBC News. \"It depends on the region but 50-80% of the signal is from some biogenic origin. But above that you have pollution and fire. And the fire can be from coal burning or wildfires, but in India, yes, you have a lot of agricultural fires.\" India also uses considerable quantities of wood in the home for cooking and heating. When volatile organic compounds are brought together with nitrogen dioxide (NO₂, from fossil fuel burning) and sunlight, reactions will produce ground-level ozone. This is a severe respiratory irritant that can lead to significant health problems. Notice how the Himalaya Mountains essentially corral the air on the plains, preventing it from moving north. The relative low in formaldehyde concentration in north-west India is centred over the desert lands of Rajasthan, where, obviously, there is much less vegetation and fewer people. Sentinel-5P was procured and launched by the European Space Agency for the European Union's Copernicus Earth-monitoring programme. The satellite's Tropomi instrument can detect the presence in the atmosphere of a suite of trace gases in addition to formaldehyde, including nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide (SO₂), methane, carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols (small droplets and particles). All affect the air we breathe and therefore our health, and a number of them also play a role in climate change. The Tropomi instrument itself represents a remarkable step-change on the capability of its predecessor spectrometer system known as Omi, which still flies today on an American space agency satellite. \"We already had really good data, but we needed many more days of observations, sometimes years of observations, to get this kind of quality,\" said Dr De Smedt. \"The new (India) map contains four months of data. Tropomi can do in one month what Omi did in six. \"We now see much faster the details, the small emissions, the cities - the kind of signals we didn't see so well before. We needed 10 years of data to see the emissions around Tehran, for example. In this map you can see them from only four months of Tropomi data.\" After a test and commissioning phase, S5P will go fully operational at the end of the month for some of its data products, such as nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. Others, like formaldehyde, will have to wait until the Autumn. Overall, the Tropomi investigations on S5P are led from the Netherlands Met Office (KNMI). The BIRA-IASB heads up the HCHO and SO₂ analyses. The bus, or chassis, of the satellite was assembled by Airbus in the UK, making S5P Britain's biggest single industrial contribution to the Sentinel series of satellites that have been procured for Copernicus.

    "text": "Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in the restive Balochistan province and accused of \"espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan\". Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying. Delhi says the man is an Indian citizen but has rejected spying claims. Balochistan has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Pakistan accuses India of backing. Pakistan says Mr Jadhav was detained there on 3 March 2016. \"The spy was tried through Field General Court Martial under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) and awarded the death sentence,\" Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations said in a statement on Monday. No date was given for his execution. 'Farcical' proceedings India has condemned the sentence and called the proceedings against Mr Jadhav \"farcical\". \"Shri Jadhav was kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly,\" its foreign ministry said in a statement. Officials had been denied consular access, despite 13 formal requests, and India had not been told he was being put on trial, it said. If the sentence was carried out, the statement added, India would regard it as \"premeditated murder\". The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories. In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India. It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent But last week's revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir - as the Indian state was known - and the move to split it into two union territories while imposing an unprecedented lockdown there is being seen by many as a major weakening of India's federal structure. The new union territories (Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh) will be ruled directly from Delhi. Union territories have far less autonomy from the federal government than states. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, calls them \"glorified municipalities of Delhi\". By revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, ostensibly to put it on the same footing as the rest of India, Mr Modi's government, in the words of one commentator, has \"upset India's delicate federal balance\". In many ways, Article 370 - as the constitutional article guaranteeing special status is known - was more symbolic, as presidential decrees over the years had already eroded much of the autonomy it guaranteed. What was more important, many say, was the spirit of the status: it signalled that the Indian constitution was malleable enough to make space for people who felt alienated or estranged from the mainstream. India's federalism has in fact, been hard-earned and hard-fought. Unlike more economically advanced and culturally homogenous countries with a federal system of government like the US and Canada, consensus over power sharing in a culturally and religiously diverse, poorer country like India has not been easy to forge. Thankfully the Indian constitution has provided a clear division of powers between the elected federal government and the state legislatures. \"The constitution strives to strike a delicate balance between the unitary and federal systems,\" says Yamini Aiyar, chief executive of Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research. However, there have always been doubts about what some commentators call the \"authenticity of Indian federalism\". State governors, usually political appointees of the the ruling federal government, have helped clamp direct rule in states where there has been a \"failure of constitutional machinery\". (An adverse report by the governor on the affairs of the state can become the basis of president's rule, or direct rule from Delhi, and authorise the dismissal of a state government.) Such direct rule has been declared in Indian states 88 times between 1951 and 1997. Many believe the revocation of special status from Indian-administered Kashmir - without consulting the local people and political leaders and implemented when the state was under direct rule - is another taint on India's federal record. \"The single biggest significance of this move is that we are moving towards a unitary state, and abrogation of democratic principles. This is weakening federalism in India. People are so busy celebrating the move that they don't seem to get the big picture,\" Navnita Chadha Behera, a former visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution and the author of Demystifying Kashmir, told me. \"What is more worrying is this can happen to any other state. The federal government can dissolve a state government, ride roughshod over the consultative process, split the state and downgrade its status. Also worrying is the near-complete collapse of resistance to the move with most of the civil society, media and regional parties remaining silent or protesting very feebly.\" Yamini Aiyar believes \"federalism, which the framers of India's constitution saw as necessary to India's democracy, today has far fewer takers than it did in 1947. This is dangerous for India's democracy\". Supporters of the move say that strife-ridden Kashmir is a \"special case\", and a consultative process in an insurgency-hit and militarised region next door to India's nuclear-armed rival, Pakistan, would have led nowhere. Also Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has for years consistently demanded the revocation of Article 370, calling it an example of \"appeasement\" in India's only Muslim-majority state. However, India has a history of reconciling separatist aspirations. Where else, many say, could an insurgent leader who fought a guerrilla war for independence for a quarter of a century go on to become an elected state chief minister? But this is exactly what happened when the rebel leader Laldenga signed an accord with the Indian government in the north-eastern state of Mizoram in 1986. Power sharing and inclusivity have only bolstered democracy in India and made the country more resilient. India's Supreme Court, in the past, has clearly said that the \"fact that under the scheme of constitution greater power is conferred upon the centre vis-a-vis the state does not mean that states are mere appendages of the centre.\" \"Within the sphere allotted to them, states are supreme. The centre cannot tamper with their powers,\" the court added. It has also been unequivocal about the status of federalism as a basic constitutional structure. It will be interesting to see how India's Supreme Court deals with the legal challenges against the move on Kashmir. \"This will be a test case for the top court's independence,\" says Dr Behera.

Pistorius claimed he shot dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 after mistaking her for a burglar at his home in the capital Pretoria. The lower court justified deviating from the prescribed 15-year sentence by saying mitigating circumstances such as rehabilitation and remorse outweighed aggravating factors such as his failure to fire a warning shot. But prosecutor Andrea Johnson said the sentence did not match the gravity of the crime. Pistorius, 30, is not in the court in Bloemfontein.

    "text": "By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent This is the gravitational \"shockwave\" that spread out from the biggest merger yet observed between two black holes. The signal from this event travelled for some seven billion years to reach Earth but was still sufficiently strong to rattle laser detectors in the US and Italy in May last year. Researchers say the colliding black holes produced a single entity with a mass 142 times that of our Sun. This is noteworthy. Science has long traced the presence of black holes on the sky that are quite a bit smaller or even very much larger. But this new observation inaugurates a novel class of so-called intermediate-sized black holes in the range of 100-1,000 Sun (or solar) masses. The analysis is the latest to come out of the international LIGO-VIRGO collaboration, which operates three super-sensitive gravitational wave-detection systems in America and Europe. What is a black hole? The collaboration's laser interferometer instruments \"listen\" for the vibrations in space-time that are generated by truly cataclysmic cosmic events - and on 21 May, 2019, they were all triggered by a sharp signal lasting just one-tenth of a second. Computer algorithms determined the source to be the end-stage moments of two in-spiralling black holes - one with a mass 66 times that of our Sun, and the other with 85 solar masses. The distance to the merger was calculated to be the equivalent of 150 billion trillion km. \"It's astounding, really,\" said Prof Nelson Christensen from the Côte d'Azur Observatory in France. \"This signal propagated for seven billion years. So this event happened 'just before halftime' for the Universe, and now it's mechanically moved our detectors here on Earth,\" he explained to BBC News. Gravitational waves - Ripples in space-time The involvement of an 85-solar-mass object in the collision has made collaboration scientists sit up because their understanding of how black holes form from the death of a star can't really account for something on this scale. Stars, when they exhaust their nuclear fuel, will experience an explosive core collapse to produce a black hole - if they're sufficiently big. But the physics that's assumed to operate inside stars suggests the production of black holes in the particular mass range between 65 and 120 solar masses is impossible. Dying stars that might yield such entities actually tear themselves apart and leave nothing behind. If the science is correct on this point then the most likely explanation for the existence of an 85-solar-mass object is that it was itself the result of an even earlier black hole union. And that, believes Prof Martin Hendry, from Glasgow University, UK, has implications for how the Universe evolved. \"We're talking here about a hierarchy of mergers, a possible pathway to make bigger and bigger black holes,\" he said. \"So, who knows? This 142-solar-mass black hole may have gone on to have merged with other very massive black holes - as part of a build-up process that goes all the way to those supermassive black holes we think are at the heart of galaxies.\" The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration is reporting the 21 May, 2019, event (catalogued as GW190521) in two scholarly papers. One is in the journal Physical Review Letters and describes the discovery. The second can be found in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, and discusses the signal's physical properties and scientific implications. GW190521 is one of over 50 gravitational wave triggers presently being investigated at the laser laboratories. The pace of research has increased rapidly since the collaboration made its first, Nobel-Prize-winning detection of gravitational waves in 2015. \"We are increasing the sensitivity of the detectors and, yes, we could end up making more than one detection a day. We will have a rain of black holes! But this is beautiful because we will learn so much more about them,\" Prof Alessandra Buonanno, director at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, told BBC News.

    "text": "By Sofia BettizaBBC World Service But now, they are suffering. Lombardy was the hardest-hit region in the world and medics are struggling to hold it together. Paolo Miranda is an intensive care nurse in Cremona. \"I'm more irritable,\" he says. \"I get angry easily and I pick fights.\" A few weeks ago, Paolo decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. \"I never want to forget what happened to us. It will soon become history,\" he tells me. In his photos, he wants to show how his colleagues are coping with 'Phase 2' as life goes back to normal in Italy. \"Although the emergency is slowing down, we feel surrounded by darkness,\" he says. \"It's like we are full of wounds. We carry everything we've seen inside us.\" Nightmares and night sweats It's a feeling echoed by Monica Mariotti, also an intensive care nurse. \"Things are much harder now than during the crisis,\" she says. \"We had an enemy to fight. Now that I have time to reflect, I feel so lost, aimless.\" During the crisis, they were overwhelmed and had no time to think. But as the strain of the pandemic fades, so does the adrenaline. All the stress accumulated in the past few weeks is coming to the surface. \"I have insomnia and nightmares,\" Monica says. \"I wake up 10 times each night with my heart racing and out of breath.\" Her colleague Elisa Pizzera says she felt strong during the emergency but is now exhausted. She does not have the energy to cook or take care of the house, and when she has a day off she spends most of her time sitting on the couch. No 'new normal' Martina Benedetti is an intensive care nurse in Tuscany and still refuses to see family and friends as she fears she could infect them. \"I even social distance from my husband,\" she says. \"We sleep in separate rooms.\" Even the simple things have become overwhelming. \"Every time I try to go for a walk, I feel anxious and I have to go back home immediately,\" Martina admits. Now that she's finally got time to reflect, she is full of self-doubt. \"I'm not sure I want to be a nurse anymore,\" she tells me. \"I've seen more people die in the past two months than in the whole six years.\" Some 70% of health workers dealing with Covid-19 in Italy's hardest-hit areas are suffering from burnout, a recent study shows. \"This is actually the hardest moment for doctors and nurses,\" says Serena Barello, the author of the study. When we deal with a crisis, our body produces hormones that help us handle stress. \"But when you finally have time to reflect on what happened, and society is moving on, it can all come crushing down and you feel more exhausted and emotionally distressed,\" says Dr Barello. She worries that a lot of doctors and nurses will have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms long after the pandemic. This is when the impact of a traumatic experience affects a person's life, sometimes months or even years later. For health workers, this could impede their ability to keep working with the intensity and focus their jobs require. Forgotten heroes Around the world, frontline doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat patients. But in Italy, this love is ebbing away. \"When they were scared of dying, suddenly we all became heroes but they've already forgotten us,\" says Monica. \"We will go back to being seen as people who wipe asses, lazy and useless.\" In Turin, nurses recently chained themselves together and wore bin bags, a reference to how they had to improvise in wards because of a lack of PPE. They staged a protest to demand recognition for their work. \"In March we were heroes, now we've already been forgotten,\" one nurse shouted through a megaphone. They were promised a bonus for their work but have not yet seen it. No escape At least 163 doctors and 40 nurses died from Covid-19 in Italy. Four of them took their own lives. And yet, many health workers now feel that it's almost as if this pandemic never happened. \"I feel overwhelmed with anger,\" says Elisa Nanino, a doctor who dealt with Covid-19 in care homes. Since the lockdown has been lifted, she constantly sees people drinking and eating together with no face masks and no social distancing. \"I want to go up to them and scream in their face, tell them they're putting everyone in danger,\" she says. \"It's so disrespectful to me and all my colleagues.\" One thing all the health workers agreed on is that public support helped them get through the crisis. \"I'm no hero but it made me feel important,\" Paolo says. Public recognition is the most powerful way we have to help health workers struggling with PTSD, according to Dr Barello's study. \"All of us, we have a crucial role to play right now,\" she says. \"We have to make sure we don't forget what doctors and nurses did for us.\" Soldiers can leave the battlefield and deal with their trauma back home. But for these doctors and nurses, the next 12-hour shift is always around the corner. They have to cope with all of this in the very place where they suffered so much. \"I feel like a soldier that has just returned from war,\" says Paolo. \"Obviously I didn't see weapons or dead bodies in the street but in many ways, I feel like I was in the trenches.\"",

    "text": "Churches and hotels were hit by a series of explosions in Colombo and Negombo on the west coast, and Batticaloa on the east. The blasts came as members of Sri Lanka's peaceful Christian minority prepared to attend church services for Easter Sunday. Julian Emmanuel Dr Emmanuel is a 48-year-old physician. He grew up in Sri Lanka, and now lives in Surrey, UK, with his wife and children. They were in Colombo this week to visit some of their relatives who still live in the city. They were asleep in their room in Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel when one of the bombs went off. \"We were in our bedroom and we heard this huge explosion which rocked our room, I think it was about 8:30,\" he said. \"We were then ushered to the lounge in our hotel, where we were asked to evacuate through the back. This is where we saw casualties being taken away to the hospital, and we saw some of the damage to the hotel.\" A staff member commented that she had seen a dismembered body at the site of the explosion, while his friends sent him photos of the churches that had been bombed. The hotel itself, meanwhile, had \"significant damage\" - one of the restaurants had been blown up. \"We were going to go to church today, with my mum and nephew, but all the church services have been cancelled - there aren't going to be any more church services in the country because of what's happened this morning,\" he said. \"I spent my first 18 years in Sri Lanka, so I've seen a lot of ethnic strife.\" Sri Lanka was ravaged by decades of conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups, but has been relatively peaceful since 2009. \"Whereas my kids, my children are 11 and seven, and they've never seen anything like war, and neither has my wife. For them it's quite difficult.\" He added: \"It's really sad - I thought Sri Lanka had left all this violence behind us, but now it's sad to see that it's come back again.\" Usman Ali Mr Ali lives in Colombo. He first noticed something was wrong when worshippers were \"hastily\" evacuated from a Roman Catholic church near his home. His road, which leads up to the city's main hospital, was also suddenly filled with ambulances. He checked the hashtag #LKA - Lanka - and quickly learned what was going on. Among the horrific footage and images was an appeal from the country's blood centres for people to donate to help the victims. Mr Ali went to the National Blood Centre, and found it thronged with people. \"There were huge crowds and roads congested as people tried to park wherever and enter the blood centre,\" he said. \"Currently they are taking down the name, blood group and contact number of persons who are willing to donate blood, and asking them to return only if a representative of the National Blood Centre contacts them.\" People were spilling out of the building, he said, forming \"massive queues leading all the way to the entrance\". Once inside, there was a strong community spirit. \"Everyone just had one intention, and that was to help victims of the blast, no matter what religion or race they may be. Each person was helping another out in filling [out forms with] the details requested. \"I wonder where this attack came from. God save us.\" Kieran Arasaratnam Kieran Arasaratnam, a professor at Imperial College London Business School, was staying at the Shangri-La hotel, whose second-floor restaurant was gutted in a blast. Mr Arasaratnam, a Sri Lankan who moved to the UK as a refugee 30 years ago, was visiting the country to help launch a social enterprise. He was in his room when he heard a sound like \"thunder\". He told the BBC he started running for his life from the 18th to the ground floor amid desperate scenes. \"Everyone just started to panic, it was total chaos,\" he said. \"I looked to the room on the right and there's blood everywhere. \"Everyone was running and a lot of people just don't know what was going on. People had blood on their shirt and there was someone carrying a girl to the ambulance. The walls and the floor were covered in blood.\" The 41-year-old says he might have been caught up in the blast if he had not delayed going to breakfast. He says he left his room at around 08:45 (03:15 GMT), the time when several explosions were reported to have occurred at hotels and churches in different locations. \"Something distracted me so I went back to the room to grab my debit card, opened the curtain and switched off the 'do not disturb' sign… and a big blast went off,\" he said. He says he's currently in an emergency shelter. There, he says, he can \"smell blood everywhere\", with people injured in the blast needing treatment and searching for missing family members. \"It's awful seeing kids carried off covered in blood. I left Sri Lanka 30 years ago as a refugee and never thought I had to see this again.\" Simon Whitmarsh Simon Whitmarsh, a 55-year-old retired doctor from Wales, is on holiday in Sri Lanka. He was cycling near the city of Batticaloa when he heard a \"big bang\" and saw \"smoke billowing into the sky about half a mile away\". A blast ripped through a church in the city as worshippers were gathering for services. \"Then we saw the ambulances, people crying, and we were told to leave the area,\" he told the BBC. As a former consultant paediatrician, Mr Whitmarsh says he felt compelled to help those affected so volunteered at the local hospital. \"By that stage, they had activated emergency protocols,\" he says. \"The hospital was heavily guarded by the army, who were stopping most people going in. \"All the streets around it were closed. It seemed very well organised. All I did was find someone senior to see if I could help.\" He says the nationwide curfew, imposed by Sri Lankan authorities in the wake of the blasts, has completely emptied streets and roads that were bustling only hours ago. \"Now it's curfew, there's nothing. No vehicles, no people walking, nothing,\" he says. \"'Stay indoors' is the message.\" He added: \"London people have said they were thinking of going home, but we can't do anything until the curfew finishes.\"",

    "text": "Prof Thaler, of Chicago Booth business school, co-wrote the global best seller Nudge, which looked at how people make bad or irrational choices. Judges said he had demonstrated how \"nudging\" - a term he coined - may help people to exercise better self-control. He will receive 9 million Swedish krona (£850,000) from the committee. \"I will try to spend it as irrationally as possible!\" the 72 year-old economist said. Nudging Prof Thaler's work led to the UK setting up a \"nudge unit\" under former prime minister David Cameron. It was launched in 2010 to find innovative ways of changing public behaviour and has offices in the UK, New York, Singapore and Sydney. One of the Nobel prize judges, Per Stroemberg, said Prof Thaler's work had explored how human psychology shaped economic decisions. \"Richard Thaler's findings have inspired many other researchers coming in his footsteps and it has paved the way for a new field in economics which we call behavioural economics,\" Mr Stroemberg said. The panel said Prof Thaler's insights helped people to recognise marketing tricks and avoid bad economic decisions. In particular, his work looked at how to \"nudge\" people into doing more long-term planning, such as saving for a pension. Prof Thaler also made a cameo appearance in the Hollywood film, The Big Short, explaining the complex financial instruments that led to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Americans dominate It is the final Nobel to be announced this year, after prizes for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were awarded last week. The economics prize is the only Nobel not created by Alfred Nobel, and was instead launched in 1968, long after the philanthropist's death. To date the US has dominated the prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since it started. Between 2000 and 2013, US academics won or shared the prize every year. Last year, UK-born Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom of Finland won the award - officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel - for their work on contract theory. Analysis: How 'nudge' theory works By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Prof Thaler's central insight is that we are not the rational beings beloved of more traditional economic theory. Given two options, we are likely to pick the wrong one even if that means making ourselves less well off. Lack of thinking time, habit and poor decision making mean that even when presented with a factual analysis (for example on healthy eating) we are still likely to pick burger and chips. We're hungry, we're in a hurry and burger and chips is what we always buy. Nudge theory takes account of this, based as it is on the simple premise that people will often choose what is easiest over what is wisest. Tests have shown that putting healthier foods on a higher shelf increases sales. The food is more likely to be in someone's eye line and therefore \"nudge\" that person towards the purchase - whether they had any idea about the obesity argument or not.

    "text": "The man died of head injuries on the way to hospital, Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said. Thirteen people suffered serious injuries, including two who are being transferred to Australia for treatment, one with a gunshot wound. He said the injuries occurred outside the camp, after the men broke out. Australia sends asylum seekers arriving by boat for detention and processing in offshore camps in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific territory of Nauru. Conditions in these camps have been strongly criticised by UN agencies and rights groups. 'Great risk' The violence took place late on Monday night. \"This was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the centre and place themselves at great risk,\" Mr Morrison said. Security outside the centre in Manus Island was the domain of the PNG police, he said. \"Those who are maintaining the safety of environment outside the centre need to use their powers and various accoutrements that they have available to them to restore order in the way that is provided for under PNG law,\" he said. Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition, however, said detainees at Manus Island had told him that locals and PNG police entered the camp and attacked them, after a day of tensions. \"All the people that we have talked to, whether they are workers on the island or whether it's the detainees themselves, say they were attacked,\" he told the BBC. Mr Morrison, the immigration minister, said he had been told that \"PNG police did not enter the centre and that their activities related only to dealing with transferees who breached the external perimeter\". He urged people to treat \"unsubstantiated reports that are put in the public domain\" with caution, but said he could not confirm how the various injuries were incurred. He called the death of the asylum seeker \"a great tragedy\". \"We don't know what occurred outside the centre and that obviously will be the subject of an investigation into that person's death,\" he said. But he said the violence took place in PNG and that any inquiry would take place under PNG law conducted by local authorities. The violence comes after some of the detainees briefly escaped from the detention centre on Sunday. 'Must be closed' In recent months Australia has taken a very tough stance in a bid to halt the flow of asylum seekers, who arrive by boat via Indonesia. Manus Island is one of two offshore processing camps in which asylum seekers are detained. Australia has also initiated a policy - aimed as a deterrent - whereby those people found to be genuine refugees will be settled in Papua New Guinea rather than Australia. Sunday's break-out is reported to have taken place after detainees were told that they would not be resettled in Australia. Rights groups argue that prolonged detention in cramped, over-heated conditions, compounded by a lack of clarity over when asylum claims will be assessed and where the applicant might end up, can lead to mental health issues in detainees. They have also questioned whether Australia is adequately protecting vulnerable people. Greens Party spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the violence showed the centre \"must be closed\". \"The reports that one person has died, that shots have been fired, that scores of individuals have been injured, shows that it is untenable to keep the Manus Island detention camp open,\" she said. Human Rights Commission President Gillian Triggs said in quotes carried by the Sydney Morning Herald: ''Clearly there needs to be an inquiry into this.'' ''The primary obligation that Australia has is to offer protection for asylum seekers and we cannot abdicate that responsibility by sending people to a third country, in this case Papua New Guinea, but it is clear that responsibility is not being met.'' Mr Morrison said that the government was determined to stick to its policies.",

    "text": "By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Whether soft or hard-boiled, fried or whisked into an omelette, eggs appeared to give infants a boost. It could be a cheap way to prevent stunting, say researchers in the journal Pediatrics. The first two years of life are critical for growth and development - any stunting is largely irreversible. Too short for age Poor nutrition is a major cause of stunting, along with childhood infections and illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, 155 million children under the age of five are stunted (too short for their age). Most live in low- and middle-income countries and health experts have been looking at ways to tackle the issue. Lora Iannotti and her colleagues set up a field experiment in the rural highlands of Ecuador and gave very young children (aged six to nine months) free eggs to eat to see if this might help. Egg dinners Only half of the 160 youngsters who took part in the randomised trial were fed an egg a day for six months - the others were monitored for comparison. The researchers visited the children's families every week to make sure they were sticking to the study plan and to check for any problems or side-effects, including egg allergy. Stunting was far less common among the egg treatment group by the end of the study - the prevalence was 47% less than in the non-egg group, even though relatively more of these egg-fed infants were considered short for their age at the start of the study. Some of the children in the control group did eat eggs, but nowhere near as many as the treatment group. Lead researcher Ms Iannotti said: \"We were surprised by just how effective this intervention proved to be. \"And what's great is it's very affordable and accessible for populations that are especially vulnerable to hidden hunger or nutritional deficiency.\" She said eggs were great food for young children with small stomachs. \"Eggs contain a combination of nutrients, which we think is important.\" Balanced diet Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \"In a way, it is surprising that more research has not been conducted using egg in this situation - although I know that in some cultures, parents do not necessarily find egg to be an acceptable early food mainly because of concerns about allergy. \"Egg is a good nutritious complementary food that can be introduced as part of a varied diet once the mother decides to start complementary feeding - never before four months.\" She said eggs should always be well cooked to avoid any potential infection risk. The WHO recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the child's first six months to achieve optimal growth, development and health. After the first six months, infants should be given nutritious complementary foods and continue breastfeeding up to the age of two years or beyond. The British Nutrition Foundation advised: \"While eggs are a nutritious food to include, it's very important that young children have a variety of foods in their diets. Not only is this necessary to get all the vitamins and minerals they need, but also to allow them to become familiar with a wide range of tastes and textures. \"A range of protein-rich foods should be provided when feeding young children, which can include eggs but can also feature beans, pulses, fish, especially oily fish, meat and dairy products.\"",

He is suspected of being the so-called \"Volga maniac\", who is linked to numerous crimes and killings committed in regions along Russia's Volga River. There has not yet been any comment from - or on behalf of - Mr Tagirov. On Tuesday, police said the suspect was being questioned and was providing information relating to their inquiries. Russia's Investigative Committee (SK), which operates like the FBI, said in a statement that Mr Tagirov's arrest was the result of forensic research and biological analysis, which suggested that the criminal acts against the women had been committed by one individual. It also alleged that the \"pattern\" of a number of the attacker's actions appeared to match the behaviour of the suspect, and that the committee had made the decision to detain him following \"painstaking and systematic work\". Mr Tagirov, who investigators say lives in the Russian city of Kazan, is alleged to have gained access to the homes of the victims by posing as a utility worker, before using objects such as dressing-gown cords and electricity cables to strangle them. Last year, police offered a reward of three million roubles (£30,000) for information leading to the arrest of the \"Volga maniac\" after hunting him for several years.

But teenagers will still be banned from smoking, drinking alcohol and gambling until they are 20. If parliament votes in favour of the bill it will take effect in 2022. It would be the first change to the law that defines adulthood since it was set in 1876. Under the existing law, people under 20 can only get married with the consent of their parents. Men can do so at 18 and women at 16. But this amendment will raise the age that women can get married so that all 18-year-olds will be able to do so without parental consent. The government decided to make the age of marriage the same for both sexes because there was no justifiable reason for the difference, according to Japan's Kyodo news service. Separately, the bill will allow 18 and 19-year-olds to sign contracts for mobile phones and credit cards. This has led to fears that some businesses may use sales tactics that target and exploit vulnerable young people. The bill includes clauses that are designed to protect against this problem. For example, young people will be able to cancel a contract if they believe salespeople have manipulated or pressured them into signing it. The Education and Justice Ministries have also said they will educate teenagers about the responsibilities that would come with the change.",

    "text": "Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, a key figure in the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was accused of mass killing and torture and convicted of five of seven charges. Prosecutors say he led a militia accused of killing leaders and intellectuals supporting independence. The party's spiritual leader was jailed for 90 years on Monday. Hundreds killed Thousands of people took to the streets on Tuesday to protest against Ghulam Azam's sentence, which was handed down by the International Crimes Tribunal in Dhaka. At least two people were killed when police clashed with demonstrators. The tribunal was set up in 2010 by the current Awami League-led government to try alleged local collaborators of the Pakistani army during Bangladesh's war of independence. More than 100 people have been killed since January in violent protests prompted by verdicts handed down by the tribunal. Jamaat-e-Islami says the trials are politically motivated, and Human Rights Watch describes them as \"flawed\". AFP news agency reported that Justice Obaidul Hassan ordered that Mr Mujahid be \"hanged by the neck\" after the panel of three judges read out the verdict at Wednesday's hearing to the packed courtroom in Dhaka. Mr Mujahid was a student leader in 1971 and among those who supported a unified Pakistan. Like many other Jamaat leaders he went into hiding soon after independence, but resurfaced after Gen Ziaur Rahman came to power in a military coup in 1977. He later became social welfare minister in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government from 2001-2006. He is highly regarded for his oratory and organisational skills, but critics say he was a leader of the al-Badr group, which was an auxiliary force that helped the Pakistani army identify and kill pro-independence Bengali activists. There is a range of estimates for the exact number of people killed in the nine-month Bangladeshi war of secession. Government figures suggest as many as three million people died.",

    "text": "By Hannah RitchieOxford Martin School In 1950, global average life expectancy at birth was only 46. By 2015, it had shot up to over 71. In some countries, progress has not always been smooth. Disease, epidemics and unexpected events are a reminder that ever-longer lives are not a given. Meanwhile, the deaths that may preoccupy us - from terrorism, war and natural disasters - make up less than 0.5% of all deaths combined. But across the world, many are still dying too young and from preventable causes. The story of when people die is really a story of how they die, and how this has changed over time. Causes of death around the world About 56 million people in the world died in 2017. This is 10 million more than in 1990, as the global population has increased and people live longer on average. More than 70% die from non-communicable, chronic diseases. These are not passed from person to person and typically progress slowly. The biggest single killer is cardiovascular disease, which affects the heart and arteries and is responsible for every third death. This is twice the rate of cancers - the second leading cause - which account for about one in six of all deaths. Other non-contagious diseases such as diabetes, certain respiratory diseases and dementia are also near the top of the list. Preventable deaths What may be more shocking is the number of people who still die from preventable causes. About 1.6 million died from diseases related to diarrhoea in 2017, putting it in the top 10 causes of death. In some countries, it's one of the largest killers. Neonatal disorders - the death of a baby within the first 28 days - claimed 1.8 million newborns in 2017. The frequency of these deaths varies greatly from country to country. In Japan, fewer than one in 1,000 babies die in the first 28 days of life, compared with just under one in 20 in some of the world's poorest countries. Other preventable deaths are high up the list. Road accidents incur a high death toll in the richest and poorest countries alike, claiming 1.2 million lives in 2017. While many high-income countries have seen significant falls in road deaths in recent decades, globally the number dying on the roads has almost stayed the same. Meanwhile, almost twice as many people around the world died from suicide as from homicide - the killing of one person by another. In the UK, suicide deaths were 16 times higher; it is the leading cause of death for men aged 20-40. What types of death tell us What people die from changes over time and as their country develops. In the past, infectious diseases played a bigger part than they do today. In 1990, one in three deaths resulted from communicable and infectious diseases; by 2017 this had fallen to one in five. Children are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. As recently as the 19th Century, every third child in the world died before the age of five. Child mortality rates have fallen significantly since then thanks to vaccines and improvements in hygiene, nutrition, healthcare and clean water access. Child deaths in rich countries are now relatively rare, while the poorest regions today have child mortality rates similar to the UK and Sweden in the first half of the 20th Century, and are continuing to catch up. The decline in global child deaths is one of the greatest success stories of modern healthcare. The number of children dying each year has more than halved in recent decades, as we have got better at fighting contagious and infectious diseases. This has shifted death rates towards non-contagious diseases in elderly people. Many countries have growing concerns about the increasing burden on relatives and healthcare systems as people get older and have longer-term illnesses. More stories like this Unexpected events can throw this steady improvement off course. The 1980s HIV/Aids crisis is a striking example of this. The epidemic was felt across all regions of the world, but the most notable impact on life expectancy was in sub-Saharan Africa. After decades of steady improvement, life expectancy fell substantially across many countries in the region. A combination of anti-retroviral therapy, treatment and education on prevention means global deaths from Aids-related illness have halved in the last decade alone - from 2 million per year down to 1 million. Life expectancy has since began to recover in these countries, but is only now returning to pre-crisis levels. Even in the richest countries, continued progress is not a given. Life expectancy in the US has fallen slightly over the past few years, largely as a result of the opioid drug crisis. Life expectancy for new mothers has also not consistently increased. There are about 10 countries where a young woman today would be more likely to die during or shortly after childbirth than her mother was, including the US. Further to go Today's overall picture is positive: we are living longer lives while fewer people - especially children - are dying from preventable causes. But it's also true that we still have a long way to go. Further improvements in sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, vaccination and basic healthcare are all crucial to this. So too are increased safety measures and mental health provision. Understanding what people die from is crucial if we want this recent progress to continue.

    "text": "Mr Weinstein, 66, also agreed to wear a GPS tracker and to surrender his passport after turning himself in to police on Friday. He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyer said he would plead not guilty. The actress Rose McGowan, who accused Mr Weinstein of rape, told the BBC it was an \"amazing day for his survivors\". \"It's a very significant moment, it's a concrete slap in the face of abusive power,\" she said. \"It's just the beginning of that process and if we can see this through to the end, I hope we emerge victorious.\" The allegations against the disgraced film producer triggered the #MeToo movement, which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. More than 70 women have accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct although the charges relate to only two of them. Some allegations date back decades. Led to court in handcuffs New York City police said on Friday that Mr Weinstein had been charged with rape, sex abuse, sexual misconduct and a criminal sex act. The charges related to incidents involving two women, who were not identified. He had arrived at a police station in lower Manhattan during the morning, carrying three books. After having his mugshot and fingerprints taken, he was led out in handcuffs and taken to court. In the brief court appearance, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said the former studio boss had \"used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually\". Witnesses say Mr Weinstein appeared pale and stared into space while prosecutors outlined the bail agreement. The case was then adjourned until 30 July. Outside the court, Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, told reporters his client would enter a not guilty plea. \"We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges,\" Mr Brafman said. \"We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence.\" The New York Police Department issued a statement thanking \"these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice\". The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges was confirmed by her lawyer on Friday. Former actress Lucia Evans had already publicly accused Mr Weinstein of forcing her into oral sex in 2004. \"This is an emotional moment,\" her lawyer, Carrie Golberg, said in a statement. \"Today is big. But sexual violence is still happening. A victim or offender's fame should not matter. These cases must be prosecuted.\" These are the first criminal charges against Mr Weinstein, who already faces a raft of civil lawsuits. Mr Weinstein was fired last year from his production firm, the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. He has been condemned by top industry figures, and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him from its membership.",

    "text": "By Prashant KidambiHistorian By a curious historical irony, a sport that was the exclusive preserve of colonial elite is now the national passion of the formerly colonised. What is equally extraordinary is that India has become world cricket's sole superpower. It is a status much savoured by contemporary Indians, for whom their cricket team is the nation. They regard \"team India\" as a symbol of national unity, and its players a reflection of the country's diversity. Cricket Country \"In this last decade,\" former cricketer Rahul Dravid noted in 2011, \"the Indian team represents, more than ever before, the country we come from - of people from vastly different cultures, who speak different languages, follow different religions, belong to different classes.\" But the link between cricket and the nation was neither natural nor inevitable. It took 12 years and three aborted attempts before the first composite Indian team took to the cricket field in the summer of 1911. And contrary to popular perception - fostered by the hugely successful Hindi film Lagaan - this \"national team\" was constituted by - and not against - empire. A diverse coalition of Indian businessmen, princely aristocrats and publicists, working in tandem with British governors, civil servants, journalists, soldiers, and professional coaches made possible the idea of India on the cricket pitch. Because of this alliance between colonial and local elites, India was represented by a cricket team in imperial Britain more than a hundred summers before Virat Kohli and his men embarked on their campaign for the 2019 ICC World Cup. The magical Ranji The project to construct an \"Indian\" cricket team had a long and tortuous history. The idea was first floated in 1898, following the stunning rise of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji or Ranji, an Indian prince who bewitched Britain and the wider imperial world with his sublime batting. Indian cricket promoters sought to capitalise on Ranji's celebrity in putting together a team. But Ranji, who used his cricketing prestige to become the ruler of Nawanagar, was wary of a project that might raise questions about his nationality and, in particular, his right to represent England on the cricket field. There were some in the English establishment - notably, Lord Harris, the ex-Governor of what was then Bombay - who had never reconciled themselves to Ranji's astonishing cricketing success and continued to regard him as a mere \"bird of passage\". Four years later, a different imperative was at work. Now, Europeans in colonial India, who sought to attract teams from home, collaborated with powerful local elites to create an Indian team that would showcase the country's potential as a cricketing destination. But the venture failed because of fierce divisions between Hindus, Parsis and Muslims over the question of their representation in the proposed team. A subsequent attempt in 1906 met with the same fate as previous failed ventures. The years between 1907 and 1909 saw a wave of \"revolutionary\" violence by young Indians who targeted British officials and their local collaborators. And there were strident calls in Britain to prevent the free movement of Indians into the country. Curious Cast Dismayed by the negative publicity generated by these acts, leading businessmen and public figures, along with prominent Indian princes, sought to revive the project of sending an Indian cricket team to London. This was the historical context within which the first \"all-India\" cricket team took shape. The men who were chosen to represent India on the imperial stage made for an improbable cast of characters. The captain of the team was 19-year old Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, the pleasure-seeking, newly enthroned maharaja of the most powerful Sikh state in India. The rest of the team was selected on the basis of religion: there were six Parsis, five Hindus and three Muslims in the side. But the most remarkable feature of the first Indian cricket team was the presence of two Dalits from what was then Bombay - the Palwankar brothers, Baloo and Shivram, who overcame the resistance of upper-caste Hindus to become top cricketers of their time. The composition of this team shows how in the early 20th Century, cricket took on a range of cultural and political meanings within colonial India. For the Parsis, the cricket field acquired new significance at a time of deepening anxieties about the community's supposed deterioration. As Hindus and Muslims became more competitive on the pitch and elsewhere, Parsis began to fret about their own decline. Among northern India's Muslims too, cricket came to embody a new relationship with the political order established by British rule in the subcontinent. Notably, the game was an integral feature of the one of the most important educational initiatives in colonial India: to forge a new Muslim political identity. Of the four Muslim players named in the first Indian team, three came from Aligarh, whose most well-known institution - the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College - had been established by the social reformer Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan to promote western learning within his community. And finally, cricket also became a prism through which Hindu society was forced to reassess the insidious effects of the caste system. At the heart of these debates was the stirring example of an extraordinary Dalit family, whose cricketing ability and achievements questioned the pernicious system of inequity and exclusion practiced by upper-castes Hindus. For the Palwankars, cricket made their struggle for dignity and justice against discrimination possible. Baloo, in particular, became one of the most well-known public figures among his downtrodden compatriots. He was also the hero of the great BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's Constitution and a Dalit icon. For Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, on the other hand, the imperial game was an important instrument in furthering his political interests. The embattled ruler sought to use his position as captain of the first all-India cricket team to quell growing imperial doubts about his abilities as a ruler. Empire loyalism For the empire loyalists who financed and organised the venture, cricket became a means of promoting a positive image of India and assuring authorities in Britain that the country would remain a loyal part of the British Empire. That was the principal aim of the first all-India cricket tour of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The timing was not a coincidence: it was the year George V was formally crowned king-emperor in London and then travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar. It is salutary to recall this long-forgotten history at a time when cricket in the subcontinent has become the vehicle of a shrill hyper-nationalism that views sport as \"war minus the shooting\".

    "text": "The move reverses a decision made in 2012 by then-Home Secretary Theresa May that forced overseas students to leave four months after finishing a degree. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the change would see students \"unlock their potential\" and begin careers in the UK. But campaign group Migration Watch called it a \"retrograde\" step. The change will apply to international students in the UK - there were around 450,000 last year - who start courses at undergraduate level or above from next year onwards. They must be studying at an institution with a track record in upholding immigration checks. Under the proposals, there is no restriction on the kinds of jobs students would have to seek and no cap on numbers. \"If one needed evidence of a new approach to immigration within government, today's announcement allowing all foreign students to stay for two years after graduation is just that,\" the BBC's home editor Mark Easton said. \"Where Theresa May introduced what she called a hostile environment around migration rules, with an ambition to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, Boris Johnson has promised to scrap that target and encourage the brightest and best to come and live and work in global Britain.\" 'To hell and back' Student Shreya Swamy, from India, says the proposal is \"a great step forward\" but it is \"a sad day\" for her as it has come too late to help students already in the UK. She has just finished studying for a master's degree at the University for the Creative Arts, in Kent and Surrey, and says she has \"struggled so much\" with the current rule giving her up to four months to look for work. Jobs for international graduates \"are close to nil\", she says, blaming their lack of experience. \"I have been through hell and back trying to figure out my career plan these past few months because it seems practically impossible to have one in the UK,\" she says. \"I feel really helpless, and almost regret coming here to study because I'm going to end up going back home with a very expensive piece of paper.\" Read more here Chancellor Sajid Javid tweeted that the move was \"about time\", adding that the government \"should have reversed this silly policy years ago\". Former universities minister Jo Johnson - who quit his brother's government last week - tweeted that it was \"success at last\" after being involved in the cross-party campaign. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the decision, saying it would benefit the UK economy and reinstate the UK as a \"first choice study destination\". \"Evidence shows that international students bring significant positive social outcomes to the UK as well as £26bn in economic contributions, but for too long the lack of post-study work opportunities in the UK has put us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting those students,\" he said. But Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the decision was an \"unwise\" step that would \"likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves\". \"Our universities are attracting a record number of overseas students so there is no need to devalue a study visa by turning it into a backdoor route for working here,\" he added. Others suggested that the overhaul of the rules should come in sooner so students who are due to graduate next year could be eligible for the visa. Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, said there was \"ample time\" for the new rules to be implemented for those who finish their studies in 2020. How many international students stay in the UK? By BBC Reality Check team Just over 450,000 international students are currently studying in UK universities. Of these, almost two-thirds are from outside the EU, so will require a student visa to be in the country. Between about 170,000 and 185,000 of these students graduate each year and, under current rules, they have four months to transfer to another visa - such as a work visa - or decide to continue studying. In 2018, 6,300 individuals moved from student visas to skilled work visas, meaning they have officially been offered a job paying at least £20,800 in the first year. A further 450 were granted \"high-value migrant\" visas, which are normally reserved for those with particular expertise in a field or those who have a set sum of money to invest in the country. We also know that almost 40,000 student visas are extended each year, implying that a large number of graduates are continuing studies in the UK. That still leaves more than 100,000 students not formally extending their visas - and we don't have complete figures for how many of them leave the UK. However, analysis of exit checks by the Office of National Statistics suggests that 97% of them were leaving on time. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Labour has always said graduates should be able to work here after their studies. \"It enables them to contribute to our economy, our universities and to research, and helps us to attract the brightest and best from around the world. \"It is a great pity that ministers have previously supported measures that did the opposite.\" 'International collaboration' The government's announcement coincides with the launch of a £200m genetics project at the UK Biobank, a charity and health resource that contains information and samples from 500,000 people. The UK Biobank collected DNA samples and health questionnaire information from 500,000 British volunteers over several years and is now open to researchers from anywhere in the world who want to use those resources to develop new treatments for diseases. The prime minister said projects of this kind wouldn't be possible \"without being open to the brightest and the best from across the globe to study and work\" in the UK. Mr Johnson said: \"That's why we're unveiling a new route for international students to unlock their potential and start their careers in the UK.\" Britain had a \"proud history\" of being at the centre of international collaboration, he said, adding that it was \"bringing together experts from around the globe to work in the UK on the world's largest genetics research project\".",

    "text": "The alleged hacker, Paige Thompson, was arrested on Monday after reportedly boasting about the breach online. Capital One said the data included names, addresses and phone numbers of people who applied for its products. But the hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, it said. The data breach is believed to be one of the largest in banking history. How many people have been affected? Capital One is a major credit card issuer in the US and also operates retail banks. The firm said in a statement released on Monday that the breach affected approximately 100 million individuals in the US and six million people in Canada. The statement added that about 140,000 social security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised in the US. In Canada, about one million social insurance numbers belonging to Capital One credit card customers were also compromised. The hack was identified on 19 July. Capital One said the hacker was able to \"exploit\" a \"configuration vulnerability\" in the company's infrastructure. Aside from names and dates of birth, the hacker also managed to obtain credit scores, limits, balances, payment history and contact information. How has Capital One reacted? Capital One said it was unlikely the information was used for fraud but it would continue to investigate the breach. The company will notify those affected and will provide them with free credit monitoring and identity protection. Chairman Richard Fairbank said in a statement: \"While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened. \"I sincerely apologise for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right. \" What do we know about the alleged hacker? The US justice department has confirmed it has arrested a former Seattle technology company software engineer in connection with the breach. Ms Thompson, 33, was arrested on Monday on charges of computer fraud and abuse. She made an initial appearance in federal court in Seattle. A hearing has been scheduled for 1 August. Court documents claim she boasted about the data breach on an online forum. A statement by the US attorney's office in Washington said: \"On July 17 2019, a GitHub user who saw the post alerted Capital One to the possibility it had suffered a data theft.\" Ms Thompson faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 (£204,713) fine.

    "text": "By Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News As it rose, during this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite turned a striking shade of red or ruddy brown. The \"totality\" period, where light from the Moon was totally obscured, lasted for one hour, 43 minutes. At least part of the eclipse was visible from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, most of Asia and South America. In the UK, where the weather allowed, the Moon could be seen to turn red - fully eclipsed by Earth - from when it rose at 21:00 until 22:15 BST. Over the coming days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 - visible as a \"bright red star\" where skies are clear. Why did the eclipse last so long? The Moon passed right through the centre of the Earth's shadow, at the shadow's widest point. \"This is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be,\" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist at University of Manchester, explained. It coincided not only with Mars's close approach, but with what he described as a \"procession of planets\" - a line-up of our celestial neighbours that gave skywatchers a particularly good view of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. Eclipse terms Umbra: The darker, central part of the Earth's shadow Penumbra: The lighter, outer part of the shadow cast by our planet Because the Moon is far away from Earth relatively speaking - its orbit is an ellipse, so it moves closer and further and looks larger and smaller from Earth. Mars could also be seen as a bright red star just below the Moon. \"Every couple of years or so, the Earth overtakes Mars on the inside as it orbits the Sun, so Mars is closest to us,\" said Prof O'Brien. \"And because of the elliptical shape of the orbit, it's even closer than normal.\" Where was the eclipse visible? Where skies were free of cloud, the spectacle was visible almost everywhere around the world, with the exception of North America. The eclipse had already started by the time the Moon rose over the UK and Western Europe. People in the UK needed a clear south-eastern horizon as the Moon came up in order to see it. The best views - where the weather permitted - were across Eastern Europe, Central and East Africa and South East Asia, from where the entire eclipse was visible. So, from the UK and Europe, the south-east was the place to look for the rising, eclipsing Moon with a bright red Mars below. Jupiter could also be seen in the southern sky and Venus in the west. Dr Emily Brunsden, director of the University of York's Astrocampus, added that this eclipse was a \"micro blood moon\". \"This is a total eclipse at a time in its orbit when it is close to being the farthest from Earth, or at apogee,\" she said. \"Hence the Moon was fractionally smaller than usual.\" Stages of a total lunar eclipse Source: timeanddate.com Did you see the \"blood moon\"?

    "text": "The White Garden, at Kensington Palace, was planted to mark 20 years since Princess Diana died in a car crash. The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour. A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said: \"The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother.\" They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission. Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12. The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white \"Elvis\" Catherine Walker dress. The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s. Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago. The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos. It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.",

    "text": "What has caused these losses in such a big market? With more than a billion mobile subscribers, India is one of the world's biggest telecoms markets. But there are two reasons for this bloodbath. The first is that for many years while the prices of telephone calls fell, data prices continued to remain high. However, with the entry of Reliance Jio three years ago, this entirely changed. The company slashed data prices and, in the process, managed to change what was essentially a voice market into a data market. This resulted in India ending up with the cheapest mobile data in the world. But this put massive pressure on the players already in the market. They had to match Reliance and, in the process, they ended up with too little profit or making losses. But the second and more imminent reason is the battle over adjusted gross revenue - in layman's terms this means that a certain proportion of revenues earned by telecoms companies needs to be shared with the government's department of telecoms. However, telecoms companies and the government have been disagreeing on the definition of adjusted gross revenue since 2005. The companies only wanted revenue from telecoms to be calculated in this figure, but the government wanted a much wider definition, including non-telecoms revenue like sale of assets and interest earned on deposits. But recently, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the government, which meant that telecoms companies needed to pay the authorities 900bn rupees. Just Vodafone India's share is 390bn rupees. This new charge means that losses have gone up dramatically. Will Vodafone really exit India? Where is all this money going to come from? That's the question all the telecoms companies are asking. Earlier this week, Vodafone's CEO Nick Read warned that the company's India operation could be in doubt unless the government stopped hitting operators with higher taxes and charges. Known as Vodafone-Idea in the country, after it formed a joint venture with a local firm, the company controls about 29% of the telecoms market, in revenue terms. \"Financially there's been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and, on top of that, we got the negative Supreme Court decision,\" he was reported as saying on Tuesday. A day later, he apologised to the government and said the company had no plans to exit India. But the fact is that regardless of this apology, the bigger issue is that Vodafone has written off their India investment to zero. Also, the buzz is that neither Vodafone nor Aditya Birla Group, the other owner of Vodafone-Idea, is keen to bring in new money into the company. So essentially, unless the owners actually reverse this stand and agree to put more money into India, the possibility that they will exit is still very high. How bad is this for business? If a company as big as Vodafone decides to exit, it does not show India in a very good light. This is not just about the current Supreme Court decision. The fact is that there has been a retrospective tax issue going on between Vodafone and the Indian government for the past 10 years. So when a big brand like Vodafone decides to shut shop and get out of the country, it is bound to make other investors think twice before entering India. Should customers be worried? Not immediately, but what is likely to happen now is that irrespective of Vodafone leaving India or not, telecoms prices will go up. But prices going up is not necessarily a bad thing - it would in fact be a good thing, because that is the only way to have some competition in this market. This needs to happen for telecoms - and Vodafone - to survive and thrive in India. The fact is that if Vodafone exits, there will be basically just two big players, and a duopoly is not good for any market.",

    "text": "Including its access roads, the bridge spans 55km (34 miles) and connects Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai. The bridge cost about $20bn (£15.3bn) and should have opened in 2016. Construction has been dogged by safety issues - at least 18 workers have died on the project, officials say. Mr Xi attended the opening ceremony of the bridge, which took place in Zhuhai, along with the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau. Limited bus services begin on Wednesday. What's so special about this bridge? Designed to withstand earthquakes and typhoons, it was built using 400,000 tonnes of steel, enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers. About 30km of its total length crosses the sea of the Pearl River delta. To allow ships through, a 6.7km section in the middle dips into an undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands. The remaining sections are link roads, viaducts and land tunnels connecting Zhuhai and Hong Kong to the main bridge. Why has it been built? It is part of China's plan to create a Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in southern China. The area is currently home to 68 million people. In the past, travelling between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would take up to four hours - the new bridge cuts this down to 30 minutes. Can anyone drive across the bridge? No. Those who want to cross the bridge must obtain special permits, allocated by a quota system. And all vehicles will pay a toll. The bridge is not served by public transport, so private shuttle buses will ply the route. There is no rail link. Authorities initially estimated that 9,200 vehicles would cross the bridge every day. They later lowered their estimations after new transport networks were built in the region. What are people saying about it? There's been a great deal of criticism of the project. It has been dubbed the \"bridge of death\" by some local media. At least nine workers on the Hong Kong side have died and officials told BBC News Chinese that nine had died on the mainland side, too. Hundreds of workers have also been injured during the construction. It's fitted with 'yawn cams'? Special cameras will be on the look-out for drivers on the bridge who show signs of getting sleepy, among other checks - yawn three times and the authorities will be alerted, local media report. To help counter potential terror attacks, there will also be \"48 high-definition surveillance cameras\" mounted at intervals along the bridge as well as anti-terror police patrols, the South China Morning Post reports. And drivers will have to change which side of the road they are on at the crossing. People drive on the left in Hong Kong and Macau but the bridge is Chinese territory and special merger channels have been built to cope with this. You might also be interested in: There have also been concerns about the environmental impact. Environmental groups say the project may have caused serious harm to marine life in the area, including the critically rare Chinese white dolphin. The number of dolphins seen in Hong Kong waters has decreased from 148 to 47 in the past 10 years and they are now absent from the waters near the bridge, according to the Hong Kong branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). \"The project has made irreversible damage to the sea,\" said Samantha Lee, Assistant Director of Ocean Conservation at the WWF. \"I am worried that the number will never rise again.\" Is it going to recoup its costs? The bridge, surrounding link roads and artificial islands cost a staggering $20bn to build - the main bridge alone cost $6.92bn. Chinese officials say it will generate up to 10 trillion yuan ($1.44tn; £1tn) for the economy, but one Hong Kong lawmaker cast doubt on that figure. \"I am not so sure either how the bridge can sustain itself if not many cars are using it,\" Tanya Chan told BBC News Chinese. \"I am pretty sure that we would never earn that [construction cost] back.\" According to an estimate by BBC Chinese, the bridge will only earn around $86m in tolls per year. In fact, the bridge's maintenance costs would already take away a third of this income. Critics have called the bridge a \"big white elephant\" that guarantees no economic return. Others have said its main purpose is symbolic, ensuring Hong Kong is physically connected to the mainland. Additional reporting by Lam Cho Wai, BBC Chinese.",

The al-Shabab militant group said it had carried out the attack, using a car bomb to blast through the gates before sending its fighters inside. Military officials say the jihadists were repulsed without breaching the perimeter fence. No casualties were reported among the Somali military. In a statement, US Ambassador Donald Yamamoto praised the Somali military for their \"alertness and swift response\". \"This attack yet again demonstrates al-Shabab violently opposes progress towards peace and prosperity in Somalia,\" he said. Al-Shabab said in a statement it had launched the raid, adding: \"After breaching the perimeters of the heavily fortified base, the mujahideen [holy warriors] stormed the military complex, engaging the crusaders in an intense firefight.\" The base, about 100km (60 miles) west of the capital Mogadishu, is said to house US special forces, Somali special forces and Ugandan peacekeepers. It is used as a launch site for US drones as well as being a training centre. US Somali operation shrouded in secrecy By Mary Harper, BBC World Service Africa editor The fact that al-Shabab managed to attack two foreign targets in a single day proves its enduring power, 13 years after it came into existence. It shows it is a well-coordinated force, with a sophisticated intelligence network. The assault on the US military training base at Baledogle airport will be an embarrassment to the Americans, who have stepped up drone attacks on al-Shabab since Donald Trump became president. The US military is also active on the ground in Somalia, training an elite group of Somali commandos known as The Shield and taking part in special operations, always shrouded in secrecy. Al-Shabab seems impervious to the multitude of forces ranged against it, from thousands of African Union troops, to Western and other foreign special forces, to a large if fractured Somali army. The group does far more than stage attacks on its enemies. It imposes fines and taxes, even in government-controlled areas. It provides effective - if brutal - judicial services, which are as popular with those living outside the areas it controls as those inside them. It is essentially a governing force, and is likely to remain so until the Somali government and its allies form a credible, functioning alternative.

    "text": "The 54-year-old actress, known simply as Sridevi, drowned in her hotel apartment's bathtub following loss of consciousness, it says. It had earlier been reported that she died of cardiac arrest on Saturday while at a family wedding in Dubai. Bollywood stars, sporting giants and leading politicians have reacted with shock to her death. The media arm of the Dubai government said the post-mortem analysis had been completed and the cause of death ascertained. The case has been passed to the Dubai Public Prosecution for what officials said were \"regular legal procedures\". The post-mortem report has been released by Dubai police to Sridevi's family and the Indian consulate, the Gulf News says. The paper said the report could mean a delay to the repatriation of the body. It had been expected to be flown home on Monday. Crowds have gathered outside Sridevi's home in Mumbai to pay their last respects ahead of a cremation. The Dubai government tweet did not reveal the results of any toxicology tests. The full post-mortem report has not yet been made public and will be expected to explain how the original report of cardiac arrest and the listing of \"accidental drowning\" are linked. The actress had been in the United Arab Emirates to attend the wedding of her nephew, Mohit Marwah. Few details had been given about the case prior to Monday's release of the cause of death. What has the reaction been to Sridevi's death? Why was she such a huge box-office draw? The star of such classics as Mr India, Chandni, ChaalBaaz and Sadma, Sridevi worked in the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi languages. Her acting career began at the age of four and by 13 she was cast in the adult role of a woman avenging her lover's death. Sridevi debuted as a lead actress in a Bollywood film in 1978, soon becoming one of India's biggest film stars. She was considered one of the very few Indian female superstars capable of huge box-office success without the support of a male hero. The actress decided to take a break from the film industry after the release of Judaai in 1997. She made a comeback in 2012, starring in English Vinglish. In 2013, the Indian government awarded her the Padma Shri - the country's fourth-highest civilian honour.

    "text": "At a halfway house in Hiroshima - for criminals who are being released from jail back into the community - 69-year-old Toshio Takata tells me he broke the law because he was poor. He wanted somewhere to live free of charge, even if it was behind bars. \"I reached pension age and then I ran out of money. So it occurred to me - perhaps I could live for free if I lived in jail,\" he says. \"So I took a bicycle and rode it to the police station and told the guy there: 'Look, I took this.'\" The plan worked. This was Toshio's first offence, committed when he was 62, but Japanese courts treat petty theft seriously, so it was enough to get him a one-year sentence. Small, slender, and with a tendency to giggle, Toshio looks nothing like a habitual criminal, much less someone who'd threaten women with knives. But after he was released from his first sentence, that's exactly what he did. \"I went to a park and just threatened them. I wasn't intending to do any harm. I just showed the knife to them hoping one of them would call the police. One did.\" Altogether, Toshio has spent half of the last eight years in jail. I ask him if he likes being in prison, and he points out an additional financial upside - his pension continues to be paid even while he's inside. \"It's not that I like it but I can stay there for free,\" he says. \"And when I get out I have saved some money. So it is not that painful.\" Toshio represents a striking trend in Japanese crime. In a remarkably law-abiding society, a rapidly growing proportion of crimes is carried about by over-65s. In 1997 this age group accounted for about one in 20 convictions but 20 years later the figure had grown to more than one in five - a rate that far outstrips the growth of the over-65s as a proportion of the population (though they now make up more than a quarter of the total). And like Toshio, many of these elderly lawbreakers are repeat offenders. Of the 2,500 over-65s convicted in 2016, more than a third had more than five previous convictions. Another example is Keiko (not her real name). Seventy years old, small, and neatly presented, she also tells me that it was poverty that was her undoing. \"I couldn't get along with my husband. I had nowhere to live and no place to stay. So it became my only choice: to steal,\" she says. \"Even women in their 80s who can't properly walk are committing crime. It's because they can't find food, money.\" We spoke some months ago in an ex-offender's hostel. I've been told she's since been re-arrested, and is now serving another jail-term for shoplifting. Find out more Japan's Elderly Crime Wave can be heard on Assignment on the BBC World Service from Thursday 31 January - click here for transmission times Or listen now online Theft, principally shoplifting, is overwhelmingly the biggest crime committed by elderly offenders. They mostly steal food worth less than 3,000 yen (£20) from a shop they visit regularly. Michael Newman, an Australian-born demographer with the Tokyo-based research house, Custom Products Research Group points out that the \"measly\" basic state pension in Japan is very hard to live on. In a paper published in 2016 he calculates that the costs of rent, food and healthcare alone will leave recipients in debt if they have no other income - and that's before they've paid for heating or clothes. In the past it was traditional for children to look after their parents, but in the provinces a lack of economic opportunities has led many younger people to move away, leaving their parents to fend for themselves. \"The pensioners don't want to be a burden to their children, and feel that if they can't survive on the state pension then pretty much the only way not to be a burden is to shuffle themselves away into prison,\" he says. The repeat offending is a way \"to get back into prison\" where there are three square meals a day and no bills, he says. \"It's almost as though you're rolled out, so you roll yourself back in.\" Newman points out that suicide is also becoming more common among the elderly - another way for them to fulfil what he they may regard as \"their duty to bow out\". The director of \"With Hiroshima\", the rehabilitation centre where I met Toshio Takata, also thinks changes in Japanese families have contributed to the elderly crime wave, but he emphasises the psychological consequences not the financial ones. \"Ultimately the relationship among people has changed. People have become more isolated. They don't find a place to be in this society. They cannot put up with their loneliness,\" says Kanichi Yamada, an 85-year-old who as a child was pulled out of the rubble of his home when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. \"Among the elderly who commit crimes a number have this turning point in their middle life. There is some trigger. They lose a wife or children and they just can't cope with that... Usually people don't commit crime if they have people to look after them and provide them with support.\" Toshio's story about being driven to crime as a result of poverty is just an \"excuse\", Kanichi Yamada suggests. The core of the problem is his loneliness. And one factor that may have prompted him to reoffend, he speculates, was the promise of company in jail. It's true that Toshio is alone in the world. His parents are dead, and he has lost contact with two older brothers, who don't answer his calls. He has also lost contact with his two ex-wives, both of whom he divorced, and his three children. I ask him if he thinks things would have turned out differently if he'd had a wife and family. He says they would. \"If they had been around to support me I wouldn't have done this,\" he says. Michael Newman has watched as the Japanese government has expanded prison capacity, and recruited additional female prison guards (the number of elderly women criminals is rising particularly fast, though from a low base). He's also noted the steeply rising bill for medical treatment of people in prison. You might also be interested in... The plight of Japan's modern hermits I hire a man to pretend to be my daughter's dad - and she doesn't know The Japanese men who prefer virtual girlfriends to sex There have been other changes too, as I see for myself at a prison in Fuchu, outside Tokyo, where nearly a third of the inmates are now over 60. There's a lot of marching inside Japanese prisons - marching and shouting. But here the military drill seems to be getting harder to enforce. I see a couple of grey-haired inmates at the back of one platoon struggling to keep up. One is on crutches. \"We have had to improve the facilities here,\" Masatsugu Yazawa, the prison's head of education tells me. \"We've put in handrails, special toilets. There are classes for older offenders.\" He takes me to watch one of them. It begins with a karaoke rendition of a popular song, The Reason I was Born, all about the meaning of life. The inmates are encouraged to sing along. Some look quite moved. \"We sing to show them that the real life is outside prison, and that happiness is there,\" Yazawa says. \"But still they think the life in prison is better and many come back.\" Michael Newman argues that it would be far better - and much cheaper - to look after the elderly without the expense of court proceedings and incarceration. \"We actually costed a model to build an industrial complex retirement village where people would forfeit half their pension but get free food, free board and healthcare and so on, and get to play karaoke or gate-ball with the other residents and have a relative amount of freedom. It would cost way less than what the government's spending at the moment,\" he says. But he also suggests that the tendency for Japanese courts to hand down custodial sentences for petty theft \"is slightly bizarre, in terms of the punishment actually fitting the crime\". \"The theft of a 200-yen (£1.40) sandwich could lead to an 8.4m-yen (£58,000) tax bill to provide for a two-year sentence,\" he writes in his 2016 report. That may be a hypothetical example, but I met one elderly jailbird whose experience was almost identical. He'd been given a two-year jail term for only his second offence: stealing a bottle of peppers worth £2.50. And I heard from Morio Mochizuki, who provides security for some 3,000 retail outlets in Japan, that if anything the courts are getting tougher on shoplifters. \"Even if they only stole one piece of bread,\" says Masayuki Sho of Japan's Prison Service, \"it was decided at trial that it is appropriate for them to go to prison, therefore we need to teach them the way: how to live in society without committing crime.\" I don't know whether the prison service has taught Toshio Takata this lesson, but when I ask him if he is already planning his next crime, he denies it. \"No, actually this is it,\" he says. \"I don't want to do this again, and I will soon be 70 and I will be old and frail the next time. I won't do that again.\" More from BBC Stories: Just over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul. The Intercontinental was popular with foreign visitors - which is why, on 20 January, Taliban gunmen stormed it, killing at least 40 people. Vasileios explains how he survived.

    "text": "By Howard Mustoe & Daniele PalumboBusiness reporters Yet stock markets have bounced back from steep drops in March. The most striking gains have been made in the US, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up a whopping 42% and the wider S&P 500 up 15% on the year. But the UK's FTSE 100, with its struggling oil companies, banks and airlines, all of which were whacked by the pandemic, has not had such an easy time. While it is still down 14% since the start of the year, it has seen a steady rise over the last few months and received a recent boost after a trade deal with the EU was reached and another vaccine was approved. In Japan, shares bounced back after a vaccine was found, with pharmaceutical stocks and gaming companies leading the way. Some of the growth is down to the way we measure the performance of stock markets, and some might be down to some overenthusiasm, according to investors. There is also the matter of the amount of money central banks are creating, they say. And finally, there are some small reasons for optimism. An important thing to consider is that stock market prices aren't just about the here and now, says Sue Noffke, head of UK equities at money manager Schroders. \"Stock markets look forward so they are a bit like driving a car - you have your eyes on the horizon, rather than the pothole that's in front of you,\" she says. Investors are banking on the success of the various new vaccines that have been approved or are in development in getting growth and sales back to normal. Cheap money They are also factoring in cheap borrowing, which is a boon for businesses. There is also all the money being created by central banks, and the effect that is having. The Bank of England alone plans to buy £895bn of government and corporate bonds with new money, via quantitative easing (QE). Since March the US Fed has bought more than $3 trillion (£2.25tn) of assets. These purchases are part of an effort to keep borrowing costs low, and while this new money enters the economy as purchased bonds, it has the effect of driving up prices elsewhere. \"Money has become cheaper, and cheaper money boosts the valuations of financial assets and that is what we have seen globally supporting the stock market,\" says Ms Noffke. Five dominate When we look at the performance of markets, we are typically looking at an index, which is a group of companies lumped together. The growth - or otherwise - of large companies has a bigger effect on the index's value than the movements of smaller ones. But of late, especially in the US, the larger ones have become very, very large. This means that a good year for tech companies, whose earnings have grown as more people work remotely, has masked a bad year for firms like airlines. The Nasdaq, for instance, has seen a huge rise since the start of the year. But just five companies - Google owner Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook - have almost the same value as the remaining 95 combined. \"So you look at the performance of the index, and you would think that coronavirus had not really impacted the US economy at all,\" says Ms Noffke. \"And that's clearly not the case. So it's not necessarily representative.\" 10-year trend The dominance of a few big companies in an index has coincided with the rise of so-called passive investing, where pensioners, money managers and speculators can buy a cheap investment fund that tracks an index. Hence, when investors buy these funds, they buy the underlying shares and help give prices a boost. \"What you can see for the last 10 years is an outflow of money from active funds into passive funds and that didn't change with the pandemic,\" says Johannes Petry, a post-doctoral researcher in financial markets at the University of Warwick. He says the companies that oversee these indexes, which companies go in them, and therefore which ones benefit when someone invests in a FTSE 100 fund or Nasdaq fund, have growing power because of this. While many companies join an index or leave it because of their size, this is not always the case, and index setters' rules can mean that big companies, like online retailer Boohoo for instance, aren't part of large indexes like the FTSE 100. For example, he says, electric car maker Tesla, which entered the S&P 500 index this month, is estimated to have generated an extra $100bn of demand for its shares as funds scramble to buy them. Nervous? That being said, things might be ready for a drop, says Joe Saluzzi, a partner at brokerage firm Themis Trading. \"Every day is a rally and everyone's shaking their heads,\" he says. While plenty of investors think that markets can't keep rising forever, it's hard to tell when a drop will come. He says he watches an indicator published by CNN called the Fear & Greed index. It was as high as 92 a month ago, indicating \"extreme greed\", although it has since fallen. \"When I see that it tells me people aren't really nervous and they should be,\" says Mr Saluzzi. Another pointer he watches is the ratio of bets that the market will rise compared to bets that it will fall. Recently, rising bets outweighed falling bets by the most since 2012. \"A big mistake people make is they go through the analysis we just did, we come to the conclusion that we are priced too high, I have to get out,\" he says. \"They say, 'But I'm smarter than the market.' No you're not. Nobody is.\" There are a few reasons for markets to carry on their run, says Ms Noffke, at least for a while. Plenty of people who have kept their jobs have been spending much less and will want to have some fun and make some purchases once they can, she says. Governments are unlikely to return to the austerity measures seen in the wake of the last crisis, she adds. But when markets do drop, it will be interesting to see how investors react, says Mr Saluzzi, especially younger ones who have mainly experienced a market that goes up and recovers quickly. They are a small but active part of the market. \"They are not battle-tested. They haven't been in the markets that long,\" he says. \"It gets ugly quick.\"",

    "text": "Australia's weather agency said 391.6mm of rain had fallen in the past four days in Sydney, more than three times the average rainfall for February. About 100,000 homes are without power, and officials have warned flash floods could be life-threatening. But the rainfall means only 17 fires are still burning across the state. The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) said on Monday afternoon that the rains had extinguished more than 30 fires over the weekend, calling it \"the most positive news we've had in some time\". The latest to be declared out is the Gospers Mountain blaze, north-west of Sydney. Since October it has burned 512,000 hectares, and was considered a mega-blaze that was \"too big to put out\". On Sunday, the Currowan fire, around the town of Shoalhaven, was also put out. It had burned for 74 days, destroying nearly 500,000 hectares and 312 homes. However, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has warned that fire-hit areas can be particularly prone to flooding, and that fast-moving waters can carry large amounts of debris. Water supplies in the region have also been replenished, after years of drought. The Warragamba Dam, which supplies most of Sydney's water, is heading towards being 70% full, says WaterNSW. At the end of last week it was at only 42% after one of the driest years on record. 'Huge reprieve' for firefighters From #NSWFires to #NSWFloods... the state has gone from one wave of extreme weather to another. But despite the massive disruptions, many people have been celebrating the heavy rainfall, posting videos on social media cheering it on as it thrashed the city. This has been a devastating summer for eastern and southern Australia. While I was out reporting the bushfires in recent months, I'd ask firefighters what was needed to tackle the fires. They would tell me about creating containment lines, and the importance of hazard reductions. Then almost all of them would look at the sky and tell me what they really needed was rain. Lots of it. And now, after they've put in so much work on the ground, the weather has given them what they asked for. Thirty out of 60 blazes in NSW have now been put out - a huge reprieve for the volunteer firefighters who have not stopped working for months. A severe weather warning is now in place for the entire coast of NSW, Australia's most populous state. In Sydney alone, at least 200 people were rescued by emergency services over the weekend. \"Everywhere has been hit, it's hard to pinpoint where it's worst,\" said Matt Kirby, spokesman for the State Emergency Services (SES). Several people have been injured, including four who were inside a car which was crushed by a falling tree in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. On Monday morning, emergency services were searching for one man believed to have been swept off a bridge in his car. Rail and ferry services in Sydney were also disrupted, with several platforms at one of Sydney's main stations, Central, left underwater. Dozens of schools have been closed. The state emergency minister David Elliott urged Sydney residents to help rescue services by taking warnings seriously, staying away from flooding and keeping off the roads if possible. Emergency services had advised people to stay home from work on Monday to avoid the disruption. Thousands of people in low-lying areas of the city have been told to leave or get ready to leave their homes. The Northern Beaches area has already seen significant damage, with several metres of beach being washed away in places. On Sunday night, people living around the Narrabeen Lagoon, a low-lying area in northern Sydney, were told to evacuate before roads became impassable. Waves more than 5m high have lashed the coast in areas like Collaroy, just south of Narrabeen, stripping away front gardens facing the sea. While it had stopped raining in central Sydney on Monday, more rain is forecast for the week. Government agencies have warned that high tides forecast for the coming days - known as king tides - could further worsen the flooding.",

    "text": "Based on surveys of refugees in Bangladesh, the number is much higher than Myanmar's official figure of 400. MSF said it was \"the clearest indication yet of the widespread violence\" by Myanmar authorities. The Myanmar military blames the violence on \"terrorists\" and has denied any wrongdoing. More than 647,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since August, MSF says. The aid group's survey found that at least 9,000 Rohingya died in Myanmar, also known as Burma, between 25 August and 24 September. \"In the most conservative estimations\" at least 6,700 of those deaths have been caused by violence, including at least 730 children under the age of five, according to MSF. Previously, the armed forces stated that around 400 people had been killed, most of them described as Muslim terrorists. A case for the International Criminal Court? Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent There have been plenty of detailed reports by journalists and researchers, based on interviews conducted with refugees, which make it hard to dispute that terrible human rights abuses took place at the hands of the security forces. But many of these reports focussed on the worst cases; there are several media reports about a massacre at one village called Tula Toli. Some Rohingya I interviewed told me they had fled in fear of violence, but had not actually experienced it. This well-researched figure by MSF suggests the operation conducted by the military was brutal enough to raise the possibility of taking a case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. The problem would be that Myanmar has not ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and is not bound to co-operate with it. Bringing a case would require the approval of all five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and China has until now given its full support to the Myanmar government's handling of the crisis. The military crackdown began on 25 August after Rohingya Arsa militants attacked more than 30 police posts. After an internal investigation, the Myanmar army in November exonerated itself of any blame regarding the crisis. It denied killing any civilians, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. The mostly Muslim minority are denied citizenship by Myanmar, where they are seen as immigrants from Bangladesh. The government does not use the term Rohingya but calls them Bengali Muslims. The government's assertions contradicted evidence seen by BBC correspondents. The United Nations human rights chief has said it seems like \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\". \"What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence, and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured,\" MSF Medical Director Sidney Wong said. According to MSF: Among the dead children below the age of five, MSF says more than 59% were reportedly shot, 15% burnt to death, 7% beaten to death and 2% killed by landmine blasts. \"The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar,\" Mr Wong said. In November, Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of the refugees. MSF said the agreement was \"premature\" pointing out that \"currently people are still fleeing\" and reports of violence have come even in recent weeks. The group also warned there was still very limited access for aid groups into Rakhine state. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar.",

    "text": "The Yantai city mayor confirmed the deaths, state broadcaster CCTV said. One miner remains missing. Another died last week after falling into a coma. The miners became trapped in the Hushan mine when the entrance to the tunnel collapsed after a blast on 10 January. There was joy on Sunday after the 11 were brought to the surface. \"From Sunday afternoon to this afternoon, rescue workers have not stopped searching, and found a further nine trapped miners who unfortunately all died,\" Yantai Mayor Chen Fei told a briefing on Monday. \"Along with one miner who died on Thursday, the bodies of the nine deceased miners were all lifted out of the mine.\" How did rescuers reach the miners? Rescue efforts had been expected to take weeks, but took a \"big step forwards\" on Sunday morning when \"a huge obstacle blocking the well suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft,\" lead rescue worker Du Bingjian told the state-run Global Times. The first man to be rescued had been trapped in a different part of the gold mine to the main group of 10. TV footage showed him being lifted out as emergency workers cheered. He was blindfolded to protect his eyes from the light and was immediately taken to hospital for treatment, with his condition described as \"extremely weak\". About an hour after his rescue, 10 more miners were brought out from a different section of the mine. CCTV said one of them was injured. Several others were seen walking by themselves, supported by rescue workers, before being transported to hospital. The nine dead miners were believed to have been in the \"Sixth Central Section\" of the mine, but details of how they were located are not yet known. How did the survivors cope? The miners had been working 600m (2,000ft) beneath the surface when the unexplained explosion happened, severely damaging entry to the mine and cutting off communication. For a week, there was no sign of life. Then, on 17 January, rescuers felt a pull on one of the ropes they were lowering into small shafts leading down into the dark. A paper note was then sent up on a rope from a group of 12 surviving miners - 11 trapped in one place and a 12th trapped further below. After that, the contact with the 12th miner was lost, while one of the group of 11, who had fallen into a coma after sustaining a head wound in the explosion, was confirmed dead on Thursday. A communication line was established and food and medicine were lowered down through a narrow shaft. The miners received porridge and nutritional liquids, and a few days before their rescue, requested a traditional meal of sausages. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. In September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing, also due to carbon monoxide. In December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people.",

    "text": "By Andreane WilliamsBusiness reporter Shahrzad Rafati was only 13 when she decided she would one day build a global business. She also knew that she wouldn't be able to achieve her dream if she stayed in her native Iran. So at the age of 17 her drive and confidence managed to persuade her parents to let her move by herself to Vancouver to go to university. Shahrzad arrived in the city on Canada's Pacific coast in 1996 with just one suitcase, and only a limited grasp of English. \"I couldn't communicate what I wanted to say [when I arrived], and I think that was probably the biggest challenge,\" she says. \"But I was determined to make a success out of my life.\" Today the 40-year-old continues to run BBTV, a company that helps firms around the world secure advertising revenues from videos on YouTube, Facebook and other websites and apps. Launched by Shahrzad in 2005, its high-profile clients include everyone from the National Basketball Association, to Sony, Warner Bros and Disney. Canadian newspapers have speculated that the business is worth more than $1bn (£760m). \"It's important for entrepreneurs to think as big as possible,\" she says. Shahrzad was born into a family of business leaders in Tehran in 1979, the year of the Iranian revolution. Her mother ran a textiles firm and her dad owned a property company. Life in the Iranian capital became increasingly difficult for her family following the revolution and the Iran-Iraq War that raged from 1980 to 1988. To escape the bombings by the Iraqi Air Force, Shahrzad and her family moved out of the city to a small village. \"Iran was at war for eight years, and a lot of my family's success had been taken from them,\" she says. \"I knew that I needed a different future, and a life where I could make a difference, and where equal was equal.\" So when she became a teenager she was determined to move abroad. In Vancouver she enrolled at the University of British Columbia to study computer science. She didn't know much about computers, nor did she have one to begin with, but she was passionate about maths and technology. Graduating in 2000, Shahrzad then studied French at the Université Paris-Sorbonne, and leadership at Oxford University's Said Business School. Looking back, she says that she was interested in how Apple was disrupting the music industry, and the way people consumed music, with its then iPod player and iTunes service. She realised that video would inevitably follow suit, and be streamed over the internet. \"The shift in the music consumption trend was a clear indication of where video content was heading,\" she says. \"Audio was at the start of the evolution, and it was clear to me that video was going to be next.\" So in 2005, at the age of 25, and the same year that YouTube was born, she founded BBTV. Initially it was a hardware company making a set-top box that enabled users to watch internet videos on their televisions. But not popular with buyers - people are happy to watch online videos on their computers - within just three months Shahrzad decided to change the company's focus. \"You need to fail fast, and learn from your mistakes quickly,\" she says. To pivot the company, Shahrzad says she noticed that internet users were pirating videos and uploading them to online platforms, such as the new YouTube. The copyright holders, the movie or TV companies, would then move to rapidly get the videos removed. That's when she had her big idea - to create software that would allow these firms to profit from advertisements put on all that content, rather than seek to take it down. BBTV's software tracks uploaded video content, such as the highlights of sports games, or clips from films. It does this through audio and video recognition technology, and adverts are then placed on the videos. The advertising revenues then go to the firms or sporting bodies affected, with BBTV taking a percentage. Only two years after its creation, BBTV landed one of its first major clients - the NBA - with whom it continues to work to this day. \"I was in my 20s and I was very nervous, but I really believed in our solutions,\" says Shahrzad. To help grow the business, she gained a number of investors, including Canadian tech businessman Hamed Shahbazi. Then in 2013 European entertainment group RTL purchased a 51% stake for $36m. RTL has subsequently increased its stake to 57.3%, but Shahrzad continues to have one of the largest individual shareholdings. RTL does not release separate financial data for BBTV, but its \"digital activities\" division, which includes the Canadian firm and two other businesses, had revenues of €452m ($539m; £408m) last year. BBTV now also produces software to help make online videos, and its services are available to individuals as well as companies. It claims that videos connected to its various technologies were viewed 429 billion times in 2019. Stephania Varalli, chief executive of Women Of Influence, a Canadian organisation that promotes businesswomen and other female leaders, says that Shahrzad's secret is her ability to evolve with the industry. \"She has constantly pivoted, which has kept her ahead of the game,\" says Ms Varalli. More The Boss features: As a female entrepreneur in a male-dominated industry, Shahrzad says she has had to work harder than her male counterparts. \"I have less room for error,\" she says. In BBTV she has fulfilled her ambition to create a global business, The 400 employees are spread across four main centres, its headquarters in Vancouver, and offices in New York, Los Angeles and Mumbai. Shahrzad says that there is no pay gap between her male and female staff, and that women make up 43% of the total workforce, and 46% of managers, high figures for a technology company. \"It gives me great pride,\" she says. \"This is a key factor in the reason why we are so successful at BBTV.\"",

One retired school teacher from Tianjin hit the headlines when she purchased dozens of dogs to save them. Residents and vendors in Yulin say the animals are killed in a humane way. Activists say the killing is cruel and an online campaign to ban the festival has been signed by more than 3.8 million people so far and the campaign has attracted considerable support this year from celebrities both domestic and foreign. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have spoken out on Twitter with the hashtag #StopYuLin2015. Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actor Yang Mi have said they are joining the campaign on micro blogging site Weibo. Why UK doesn't eat dog meat And Chinese actor Fan Bingbing and others posted a video online against the festival. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, this festival began in recent years, Xinhua said. City officials have distanced themselves from the gathering. \"Some residents of Yulin have the habit of coming together to eat lychees and dog meat during the summer solstice,\" the city's news office wrote on Weibo. \"The 'summer solstice lychee and dog meat festival' is a commercial term, the city has never [officially] organised a 'dog meat festival',\" it added. As in recent years, some animal lovers resorted to buying some of the dogs in order to rescue them. Yang Xiaoyun, retired school teacher, paid about 7,000 yuan ($1,100; £710) to save 100 dogs on Saturday. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says this kind of dispute puts the government in a really difficult position. The glorified consumption of dog meat generates a lot of negative foreign media reports, embarrassing the authorities. Also, the dog meat industry has been accused of many underhand tactics, including the illegal capture of family pets to use as food. But at the same time, the government is wary of the increasingly sophisticated animal rights movement, she adds. Animal rights activists in China have formed a cohesive network on social media that extends to many foreign animal welfare groups. China's leaders do not want to encourage such a movement amid a wider crackdown on civil disturbance of any kind.",

    "text": "The 11 Taliban reported freed included a member of the militant Haqqani group. The Indians released on Sunday were part of a group of seven engineers kidnapped more than a year ago with their driver in northern Afghanistan. The news came after the Taliban were said to have met the US peace envoy for the first time since talks collapsed. Zalmay Khalilzad reportedly met senior members of the group in Pakistan last week, almost a month after President Donald Trump cancelled secret plans to host a Taliban delegation in the US. The prisoner swap was one of the issues discussed at the meeting, sources told the BBC. Three key Taliban figures were released from prison in Afghanistan, according to the source within the militant group, including the former \"shadow\" governor of Nimroz province. The New York Times reported that Abdul Rashid Baluch was previously listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US Treasury Department. He was accused of deploying suicide bombers and helping finance the Taliban through the drugs trade in Afghanistan. A second \"shadow\" governor for Kunar province, and a member of the powerful Haqqani network, which is said to have been behind co-ordinated attacks on both Afghan and Nato forces in recent years, were also said to be among those released. Another eight militants were freed as part of the deal, the Associated Press news agency reported. The Taliban commanders had been held in the high-security prison at Bagram, reports said. The three Indian engineers have not been named. One of the hostages was released in March this year, while the fate of the rest of their colleagues remained unclear. There was no immediate comment from the Afghan, US or Indian authorities. The group, who were working at a power station in the northern province of Baghlan, were taken from a vehicle along with their colleagues and an Afghan driver in May 2018. Kidnappings are a serious problem in Afghanistan, where gangs or militant groups operate in large areas of the country.",

    "text": "By Arvind ChhabraBBC Punjabi, Chandigarh As mason Nazim \"Raja\" Khan toiled over the construction of a Shiva temple in a Punjab village, a thought nagged at him. There he was, a Muslim, building a Hindu temple. Yet there was no mosque nearby where he could worship. \"We had no place where we could offer namaz (prayers),\" says the 40-year-old. \"It wasn't nice for our relatives when they visited.\" It rankled, so he raised it with the 400-strong Muslim community in his village of Moom, in rural north India. But they were too poor to afford the land. 'Would you give us some land?' Most Muslims in the area do unskilled jobs, such as casual construction work, while the community's 400 or so Hindus and some 4,000 Sikhs are relatively well-off. Fast forward 18 months - with the temple nearing completion - and Raja took an unprecedented step. Earlier this year, he approached the temple administrators and told them: \"You Hindus will soon have your new temple. And you already have an older one. But we Muslims have no place to worship, nor money to buy land. Would you give us a small area of your land?\" A week later, he had an answer. The temple management had decided to hand over nearly 900 sq ft (83 sq m) of vacant land next to their temple. \"I was ecstatic,\" says Raja. \"I just couldn't find the words to express my gratitude.\" Purshottam Lal, an ayurvedic medicine practitioner who sits on the temple management panel, explains: \"It was a very genuine demand. It was unfair that while we all share our joys and sorrows together, [the Muslims] didn't have a mosque.\" Two months on, Raja and a few other masons and labourers are happily building a place where Muslims can worship. The Sikh community is contributing funds for the mosque, which shares its wall with their gurdwara, making for a rare example of communal harmony between the three religions in a land where minorities often complain about victimisation. Limitations In recent times, human rights groups have criticised the rise of what they see as an ultra-right Hindu nationalist government. Many say it has created an atmosphere of fear and mistrust between Hindus and Muslims. However, in Moom, it seems the three communities live in a congenial atmosphere. There's no history of tension between them and people of all communities freely visit any place of worship. Most Hindus go to gurdwaras and some of them wear the turbans usually worn by Sikhs. They also visit homes of the other communities to attend their rituals and functions. Gurdwara priest Giani Surjeet Singh says most functions - such as the Hindu holy recitation, geeta path - are held in the Sikh hall. \"People don't see this place just as a gurdwara but also that of a get-together point for their social functions,\" he adds. Bharat Ram, a teacher who's active in temple affairs, says: \"We're fortunate we haven't had political leaders who could polarise us or create the divide between communities. \"There is a brotherhood among people in this village that we have had since ancient times, and it meant we quickly decided to give land for the mosque.\" The people of Pakistan and India would harbour no grudge with one another, were it not for politicians, he argues. No one seems resentful of the donations of land or funds. Indeed, many Hindus and Sikhs believe the mosque won't just be for Muslims. \"It's for all villagers,\" they say. Yet, integration has its limitations. Ask them if they would like to see their sons and daughters marry into the other communities and the response is of shock. \"Look, brotherhood is one thing. Sikhs and Muslims are different religions,\" says Sikh panchayat (village council) member Chood Singh. \"Such a thing can't be accepted in our village.\" Bharat Sharma, a teacher and office bearer in the Hindu temple agrees: \"This has neither happened in the past nor can it happen in the future.\" This is a common opinion in India, where even marriage between different castes within the Hindu religion can provoke strong family opposition. But compared with other parts of India, such as West Bengal where communal tensions are high, this village in Punjab appears like paradise. \"God is everywhere - be it a gurdwara, a mosque or a temple,\" says Mr Sharma.

    "text": "By Steve RosenbergBBC News, Moscow For tsars it was by birth; Vladimir Lenin through revolution; general secretaries of the Soviet Communist Party by climbing up the party ladder to the politburo and awaiting their turn for the top job. But 20 years ago, Vladimir Putin was handed power on a Kremlin plate. The former officer of the KGB - the Soviet security service - was handpicked by President Boris Yeltsin and his inner circle to lead Russia into the 21st Century. But why Mr Putin? The 'brilliant deputy' Valentin Yumashev played a key role in Vladimir Putin becoming president of Russia. The former journalist turned Kremlin official rarely gives interviews, but he agreed to meet me and tell his story. Mr Yumashev was one of Boris Yeltsin's most trusted aides - he went on to marry Mr Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana. As Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, in 1997 he gave Mr Putin his first job in the Kremlin. \"Yeltsin's outgoing administration chief, Anatoly Chubais, told me he knew a strong manager who'd make a good deputy for me,\" Mr Yumashev recalls. \"He introduced me to Vladimir Putin and we began working together. I noticed immediately Putin's fantastic work. He was brilliant at formulating ideas, at analysing and arguing his case.\" Was there a moment, I ask, when you thought this man could be president? \"Yeltsin had several candidates in mind, like Boris Nemtsov, Sergei Stepashin and Nikolai Aksenenko. Yeltsin and I talked a lot about possible successors. At one point we discussed Putin. \"Yeltsin asked me: 'What do you think about Putin?' I think he's a superb candidate, I replied. I think you should consider him. It's clear from the way he does his job that he's ready for more difficult tasks.\" Did Putin's KGB past put him off? \"A lot of KGB agents, like Putin, had left the organisation, realising it was discredited. The fact that he was ex-KGB meant nothing. Putin had shown himself to be a liberal and a democrat, who wanted to continue market reforms.\" The secret succession In August 1999, Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister. It was a clear sign that President Yeltsin was preparing Mr Putin for the Kremlin. Mr Yeltsin was not due to leave office for another year, but in December 1999 he took the surprise decision to go early. \"Three days before New Year, Yeltsin summoned Putin to his country residence. He asked me to be present, and his new chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin. He told Putin that he wouldn't hang around until July. He'd resign on 31 December. \"Only a tiny group of people knew: me, Voloshin, Putin and Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana. Yeltsin didn't even tell his wife.\" Mr Yumashev was entrusted with writing Yeltsin's resignation speech. \"It was a hard speech to write. It was clear the text would go down in history. The message was important. That's why I wrote the famous line 'Forgive me'. \"Russians had suffered such shock and stress during the 1990s. Yeltsin had to speak about this.\" On New Year's Eve 1999, Boris Yeltsin recorded his final TV address in the Kremlin. \"It came as a shock to everyone present. Except me, who'd written the speech. People burst into tears. It was an emotional moment. \"But it was important that the news didn't leak. There were still four hours before the official announcement. So, all the people in the room were locked in. They weren't allowed to leave. I took the tape and drove to the TV station. The speech was broadcast at midday.\" Vladimir Putin became acting president. Three months later, he won the election. A member of 'The Family'? Valentin Yumashev is often referred to as a member of \"The Family\": Boris Yeltsin's inner circle that, allegedly, exerted influence over him towards the end of the 1990s. Mr Yumashev dismisses \"The Family\" as \"a myth, an invention\". But there's little doubt that during the 1990s, with President Yeltsin in failing health, the Kremlin leader placed his trust, increasingly, in a narrow circle of relatives, friends and business figures. \"Putin's entourage doesn't exert influence like this,\" explains political scientist Valery Solovei. \"There are two categories of people Putin leans towards: childhood friends, like the Rotenberg brothers and those who served in the Soviet KGB. \"But he doesn't overestimate their loyalty. Yeltsin trusted members of his family. Putin trusts no-one.\" 'No regrets - Russians trust Putin' Mr Putin has remained in power, as president or prime minister, for 20 years. In that time, he has built a system of power that revolves around him. Under his watch, Russia has become an increasingly authoritarian state, with fewer democratic rights and freedoms. \"Yeltsin believed he had a mission, and so does Putin,\" Mr Solovei says. \"Yeltsin saw himself as Moses: he wanted to lead his country out of its communist slavery. \"Putin's mission is to return to the past. He wants to avenge what he calls 'the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th Century', the fall of the USSR. He and his entourage, former KGB officers, believe the destruction of the Soviet Union was the work of Western intelligence services.\" The Vladimir Putin of today is barely recognisable from the liberal figure Mr Yumashev remembers. So, does Mr Putin's former boss regret giving him a job? \"I have no regrets,\" Mr Yumashev tells me, adding: \"It's clear that Russians still trust Putin.\" Still, Mr Yumashev thinks that Boris Yeltsin's resignation should serve as a lesson to all Russian presidents, the lesson being \"that it's very important to step down and make way for younger people. For Yeltsin this was incredibly important.\"",

    "text": "Shares in Microsoft, criticised for its slow response to the booming market for mobile devices, leapt 7.3% on the news. Mr Ballmer, who last month unveiled a restructuring to address the criticism, said in a statement: \"There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time. \"We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.\" The world's biggest software company has created a special committee to find a replacement. This committee includes Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Mr Ballmer, 57, succeeded Mr Gates in 2000. The two men met in 1973 while studying at Harvard University, and Mr Ballmer joined the company in 1980. 'Single strategy' Microsoft emerged as the undisputed leader in the technology sector, and became the world's largest company by market value. But the company had been criticised by investors recently for not reacting quickly enough to the way Apple and Google have led the way in mobile devices. Microsoft struggled as consumers began to shun desktops and laptops in favour of tablets and mobile devices. While its Windows software is used on the vast majority of PCs, Microsoft made little impact in the fast-growing tablet and smartphone segments. Microsoft's transformation plan, announced last month, is trying to address that. In a memo to staff last month, Mr Ballmer said that the changes meant the company was \"rallying behind a single strategy as one company - not a collection of divisional strategies\". The aim, he said, was to react faster to changes in the market. Andrew Bartels, analyst at Forrester Research, said Mr Ballmer has been rightly criticised for being \"caught flatfooted by the shift to tablets\". But he added that he should get big credit for successful products such as the Xbox and Bing. 'Surprise' \"The problem for Microsoft is its revenue primarily comes from sales to business. It should be viewed more like IBM, but is viewed as consumer, like Apple,\" he said. Mr Ballmer's planned departure comes shortly after activist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management took a small stake in the company, and started agitating for a change in strategy and a clear succession plan. Despite the recent criticism, the timing of his decision to go surprised analysts. \"Yes, this was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services,\" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. Born in 1956, Mr Ballmer grew up near Detroit, where his father worked as a manager at the Ford motor company. Having graduated from Harvard with a degree in mathematics and economics, he worked for two years at Procter & Gamble as an assistant product manager and attended Stanford University Graduate School of Business before joining Microsoft. The company has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits under Mr Ballmer's leadership.",

    "text": "By Michelle RobertsBBC News The biggest global study into attitudes on immunisation suggests confidence is low in some regions. The Wellcome Trust analysis includes responses from more than 140,000 people in over 140 countries. The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. You need a modern browser (with JavaScript support) to view this interactive. Do people in your country trust vaccines? Search for a country: Search for a country: People were asked how much they agree with the statement. Select a statement to see results Totals may not sum to 100% due to rounding Wellcome analysed responses to five key survey questions and calculated a \"trust in scientists\" index of high, medium or low trust. Source: Wellcome Global Monitor, Gallup World Poll 2018 Sorry, there is no data for this location No internet connection. Please try again. If you can't see the interactive tool click or tap here. The global survey reveals the number of people who say they have little confidence or trust in vaccination. When asked if vaccines were safe: When asked if they believed vaccines worked: Why does it matter? There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against deadly and debilitating infections, such as measles. Vaccines protect billions of people around the world. They have completely got rid of one disease - smallpox - and are bringing the world close to eliminating others, such as polio. But some other diseases, such as measles, are making a resurgence and experts say people avoiding vaccines, fuelled by fear and misinformation, is one of the main causes. Dr Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunisation at the WHO, said the current situation was extremely serious. \"Vaccine hesitancy has the potential, at least in some places, to really hinder the very real progress the world has made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases,\" she said. \"Any resurgence we see in these diseases are an unacceptable step backwards.\" What about measles? Countries that were close to eliminating measles have been seeing large outbreaks. Data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. A decision not to vaccinate, for whatever reason, poses a risk to others as well as the individual from being infected themselves. If enough people are vaccinated, it stops the disease from spreading through a population - something experts call \"herd immunity\". Imran Khan, from the Wellcome Trust, said: \"We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95% coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing.\" Where was trust low? Some people living in several higher-income regions were among the least certain about vaccine safety. In France - a country among several European ones now experiencing outbreaks of measles - one in three disagreed that vaccines were safe, according to the survey. That was the highest percentage for any country worldwide. People in France were also among the most likely to disagree that vaccines were effective, at 19%, and to disagree that vaccines were important for children to have, at 10%. The French government has now added eight more compulsory vaccinations to the three children in the country already receive. Neighbouring Italy - where 76% agreed vaccines were safe - recently passed a law that allows schools to ban unvaccinated children, or fine their parents, after immunisation rates dwindled. The UK has yet to go this far but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he \"won't rule out\" the idea of introducing compulsory vaccinations if necessary. The US has also been experiencing its own measles outbreak - the biggest to hit the country in decades, with more than 980 confirmed cases in 26 states in 2019 to date. In Northern America, and Southern and Northern Europe, just over 70% of people agreed that vaccines were safe. The figure was as low as 59% in Western Europe, and 50% in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, which reported the highest number of measles cases in Europe last year (53,218 in total) - only 50% of people agreed vaccines were effective. This figure was 46% in Belarus, 49% in Moldova, and 62% in Russia. Where was trust high? Most people in lower-income areas agreed vaccines were safe. The highest number was in South Asia, where 95% of people agreed, followed by Eastern Africa, where the figure was 92%. Bangladesh and Rwanda had nearly universal agreement about the safety and effectiveness and have achieved very high immunisation rates despite many challenges in physically getting vaccines to people. Rwanda became the world's first low-income country to provide young women universal access to the HPV vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. Mr Khan said: \"It shows what can be achieved with concerted effort to improve vaccine uptake.\" What makes people sceptical? In the survey, people with more trust in scientists, doctors and nurses tended to be more likely to agree that vaccines were safe. Conversely, those who had sought information about science, medicine or health recently appeared to be less likely to agree. The Wellcome report does not explore all of the reasons behind low confidence but researchers say there are likely to be many factors involved. Some of it may be complacency - if a disease has become less common, then the need to get immunised may feel less pressing when weighing the benefits against any possible risk. All medicines, vaccines included, can have side-effects. But vaccines are thoroughly tested to check they are safe and effective. The internet means beliefs and concerns about vaccines can be shared in an instant, spreading information that isn't necessarily based on fact. In Japan, concerns about the HPV vaccine and a reported link with neurological problems were widely publicised, which experts think knocked confidence in immunisation in general. Similarly, in France, there was controversy about a pandemic influenza vaccine - accusations that the government bought high quantities of the vaccine and unsubstantiated claims that it had been made too quickly and couldn't be safe. In the UK, there has been misinformation circulating about the MMR jab and autism. Dr Lindstrand said: \"One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have.\" Interactive tool produced by Becky Dale and Christine Jeavans; design by Debie Loizou; development by Scott Jarvis and Katia Artsenkova",

    "text": "No reason has been given, but last week Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first flogging. He was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam. His punishment has caused international outcry. Three weeks ago the case was referred to the Supreme Court by the office of then-King Abdullah. The new Saudi King Salman has issued a decree pardoning what are described as \"public right\" prisoners, which could include Mr Badawi. Suad al-Shammary, a rights activist and lawyer who worked with Mr Badawi on his blog, was released on Friday. She had been held for three months without charge over comments she made on Twitter, which her opponents portrayed as anti-Islamic. Health fears Raif Badawi, 30, was due to receive the lashes over a period of 20 weeks. The first round was carried out outside a mosque in Jeddah on 9 January as a crowd watched. Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar - who lives in Canada - told the BBC she was buoyed by Friday's developments. \"I ask the world to remain by my side until Raif is released.\" She said she now hated Fridays - the day of lashings. \"I turn into a mess, until I know his [Raif's] fate.\" Analysis: Becky Kelly, BBC News The hope Ensaf Haidar clings to week after week does not seem as impossible now as it once did. It's down to a royal decree issued by new Saudi King Salman which announced he would pardon some prisoners. The late King Abdullah did the same. The difference is that Abdullah imposed no conditions, but King Salman's pardons will be implemented by the interior minister. Sources in Saudi Arabia told me that if Raif is one of those prisoners offered a pardon, it will come with conditions he must sign in exchange for freedom. Typically, pardoned activists have had to stop their work and give up their right to free expression. In recent days Saudi officials have approached current prisoners of conscience unofficially inquiring about their thoughts on such potential conditional pardons, the human rights group Amnesty International discovered. On Thursday, Amnesty International said Mr Badawi could suffer \"debilitating long-term physical and mental damage\" if the flogging continues. \"Raif Badawi is a prisoner of conscience, whose only 'crime' was to set up a website for public discussion,\" said Amnesty's Philip Luther. Raif Badawi established Liberal Saudi Network, a now-closed online forum that sought to encourage debate on religious and political matters in 2008. In 2012, he was arrested and charged with \"insulting Islam through electronic channels\" and \"going beyond the realm of obedience\". In 2013 he was cleared of apostasy, which could have carried a death sentence. Saudi Arabia enforces a strict version of Islamic law and does not tolerate political dissent. It has some of the highest social media usage rates in the region, and has cracked down on domestic online criticism.",

    "text": "In Shanghai there is an entire museum containing 70,000 artefacts dedicated to one man, \"the people's scientist\" Qian Xuesen. Qian is the father of China's missile and space programme. His research helped develop the rockets that fired China's first satellite into space, and missiles that became part of its nuclear arsenal, and he is revered as a national hero. But in another superpower, where he studied and worked for more than a decade, his significant contributions are rarely remembered at all. Qian was born in 1911, as China's last imperial dynasty was about to be replaced by a republic. His parents were both well-educated and his father, after working in Japan, established China's national education system. It was evident from an early age that Qian was gifted, and he eventually graduated top of his class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, winning a rare scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. In 1935 a trim, well-dressed young man arrived in Boston. Qian may have experienced some xenophobia and racism, says Chris Jespersen, professor of history at the University of North Georgia. But there was \"also a sentiment of hope and belief that China [was] changing in fundamentally significant ways\", and he would certainly have been among people who respected his knowledge. From MIT Qian moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), to study under one of the most influential aeronautical engineers of the day, the Hungarian émigré, Theodore von Karman. There Qian shared an office with another prominent scientist, Frank Malina, who was a key member of a small group of innovators known as the Suicide Squad. The group had earned this nickname because of their attempts to build a rocket on campus, and because some of their experiments with volatile chemicals went badly wrong, says Fraser Macdonald, author of Escape from Earth: A Secret History of the Space Rocket. Though he adds that no-one died. One day Qian got drawn into a discussion of a complicated mathematical problem with Malina and other members of the group and before long he was an integral part of it, producing seminal research into rocket propulsion. At the time, rocket science was the \"stuff of cranks and fantasists,\" Macdonald says. \"No-one is taking it seriously - no mathematically inclined engineer would risk their reputation by saying this is the future.\" But that quickly changed with the start of World War II. The Suicide Squad caught the attention of the US military, which paid for research into jet-assisted take-off, where boosters were attached to the wings of aircraft to enable them to get airborne from short runways. Military funding also helped establish the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in 1943, under the directorship of Theodore von Karman. Qian, along with Frank Malina, was at the heart of the project. Qian was a Chinese citizen, but the Republic of China was an ally of the US, so there was \"no massive suspicion about a Chinese scientist at the heart of American space endeavour\", says Fraser Macdonald. Qian was given security clearance to work on classified weapons research, and even served on the US government's Science Advisory Board. By the end of the war he was one of the world's foremost experts on jet propulsion, and was sent with Theodore von Karman on an extraordinary mission to Germany, holding the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. Their goal was to interview Nazi engineers, including Wernher von Braun, Germany's leading rocket scientist; America wanted to find out exactly what the Germans knew. But by the end of the decade Qian's glittering career in the US came to a sudden halt, and his life there began to unravel. In China, Chairman Mao declared the creation of the communist People's Republic in 1949, and quickly the Chinese came to be seen in the US as \"the evil ones\", says Chris Jespersen. \"So we go through these periods in the US where we are infatuated with China, then something happens and we revile China,\" he says. Meanwhile, a new director at the JPL came to believe there was a spy ring at the lab, and shared his suspicions about some members of staff with the FBI. \"I note that they are all either Chinese or Jewish,\" says Fraser Macdonald. The Cold War was under way, and the anti-communist witch-hunts of the McCarthy era were just around the corner. It was in this atmosphere that the FBI accused Qian, Frank Malina and others of being communists, and a threat to national security. The charges against Qian were based on a 1938 document of the US Communist Party that showed he had attended a social gathering that the FBI suspected was a meeting of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Qian denied being a party member, new research suggests he joined at the same time as Frank Malina in 1938. But this doesn't necessarily make him a Marxist. To be a communist at this time was a statement of anti-racism, says Fraser Macdonald. The group wanted to highlight the threat of fascism, he says, as well as the horror of racism in the US. They were campaigning, for example, against the segregation of the local Pasadena swimming pool, and used their communist meetings to discuss it. Zuoyue Wang, professor of history at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, says there is no evidence that Qian ever spied for China or was an intelligence agent when he was in the US. He was, however, stripped of his security clearance and put under house arrest. Caltech colleagues, including Theodore von Karman, wrote to the government pleading Qian's innocence, but in vain. In 1955, when Qian had spent five years under house arrest, President Eisenhower took the decision to deport him to China. The scientist left by boat with his wife and two US-born children, telling waiting reporters he would never step foot in America again. He kept his promise. \"He was one of the most prominent scientists in America. He had contributed so much and could have contributed much more. So it's not just humiliation but also a sense of betrayal,\" says the journalist and writer, Tianyu Fang. Qian arrived as a hero in China but was not immediately admitted into the Chinese Communist Party. His record was not impeccable. His wife was the aristocratic daughter of a Nationalist leader, and until Qian's fall from grace he'd been living happily in America - he'd even taken the first steps towards applying for citizenship. When he finally became a party member in 1958, he embraced it and always tried to remain on the right side of the regime. He survived purges and the Cultural Revolution, and thus was able to pursue an extraordinary career. When he had arrived in China there was little understanding of rocket science, but 15 years later he oversaw the launch of the first Chinese satellite into space. Over the decades, he trained a new generation of scientists, and his work laid the foundations for China's Lunar Exploration Program. Ironically, the missile programme that Qian helped develop in China resulted in weapons which were then fired back on America. Qian's silkworm missiles were fired at Americans in the 1991 Gulf War, Fraser Macdonald says, and in 2016 against the USS Mason by Huti rebels in Yemen. \"So there's this odd circularity. The US expelled this expertise, and it has come back to bite them.\" In taking a tough line against domestic communism, he suggests, the country deported \"the means by which one of their main communist rivals could develop their own missiles and space programme - an extraordinary geopolitical blunder.\" A former US Secretary of the Navy, Dan Kimball - later head of the rocket propulsion company, Aerojet - once said it was \"the stupidest thing this country ever did\". Today, there is once again heightened tension between China and the US. This time it's not over ideology but trade, concerns over tech security, and China's failure - as President Donald Trump regards it - to do more to contain Covid-19. While most Americans have no idea about Qian and his role in America's space programme, Tianyu Fang says many Chinese Americans and Chinese students in the US, do know about him, and why he had to leave, and they see the parallels with the present day. \"US China relations have got so much worse they know they could be under the same suspicions as Qian's generation,\" he says. In Fraser Macdonald's view, Qian's story is a warning about what happens when you expel knowledge. \"The whole story of American science is that it is propelled by people coming from outside… but in these conservative times that's a story that becomes harder to celebrate.\" The JPL's contribution to the US space programme has, Macdonald believes, been much neglected compared to that of Wernher von Braun and other German scientists, who were taken in secret to the US soon after the visit paid to them by von Karman and Qian. Braun had been a Nazi, and yet his achievements are recognised in a way that those of Qian and others from the JPL are not, Macdonald says. \"The idea that America's first viable space programme was started by homegrown socialists - whether Jewish or Chinese - is not really a story that the US is able to hear about itself,\" he says. Qian's life spanned almost a century. In that time China grew from an economic minnow to a superpower on Earth and in space. Qian was part of that transformation. But his story could have been a great American one too - where talent, wherever it is found, could thrive. Last year, when China made history and landed on the far side of the moon, it did so in the Von Karman crater, named after the aeronautical engineer who was a mentor to Qian. A nod, perhaps, to the fact that American anti-communism helped propel China into space.

    "text": "By Samiha NettikkaraBBC News It has rolled out an ambitious project to extend regional air networks to connect underserved destinations to the major cities. The ruling BJP says its efforts have shown results, declaring that the number of airports operating in India has increased significantly. In the run-up to the Indian election, which gets under way on 11 April, BBC Reality Check is examining claims and pledges made by the main political parties. Claim: The ruling BJP party says it has increased the number of operational airports in India from 65 in 2014 to 102 by this year. It also claims that in 2017, more than 100 million passengers flew on domestic routes - and for the first time, more people travelled by air than in air-conditioned train compartments. Verdict: The data - from both government and aviation authorities - does point to more airports since 2014. But the exact number differs according to which source you use. The claims about air passenger numbers are true. How many airports? In February, the ruling BJP referred to 102 operational airports in a social media posting - saying this was up from 65 in 2014, when it came to power. There are several sources for official data - but they do not match. The Airports Authority of India, which is responsible for civil infrastructure, identifies 68 operational airports in 2013-14. By March 2018, it reported that there were 129 airports - but did not say how many were operational. A government statement in parliament in July 2018 said 101 were operational. India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - the body that regulates civil aviation - has the following figures: Its website does not have airport numbers for 2014. It is worth adding that the Congress party-led government - in power from 2009 to 2014 - told parliament that as many as 90 airports were operational by February 2014, a higher figure than that given by the BJP. And the annual report of the Ministry of Civil Aviation for the same year mentions 94 operational airports. So if you take these figures, the increase in new airports under the BJP looks less dramatic. Read more from Reality Check How many passengers? What about the BJP claim that more than 100 million passengers flew on domestic routes in 2017, and in that year more people travelled by air than in air-conditioned train compartments? A statement in parliament last year said that the total number of passengers on scheduled domestic routes was 103.75 million for the fiscal year 2016-17. And the DGCA figures show that there were already nearly 100 million passengers carried on domestic routes during the calendar year of 2016. So did more passengers travel by air than by the most expensive class of rail travel in 2017 - air conditioned (AC) coach? According to the annual report of Indian railways in 2016-17, the number of AC coach passengers that year was about 145.5 million. The DGCA says there were a total of 158.43 million passengers on both domestic and international air routes in India in 2017, surpassing those using AC train carriages. Stiff competition between domestic airlines in recent years has pushed down the cost of flights to a level now comparable with AC rail travel, and of course it's much faster. However, many more millions continue to use cheaper forms of rail travel.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent He sleepily shuffled to the verandah and looked outside. It was pitch black. Atulya Chakravarty had woken up in the middle of a rainy night to use the toilet. The two energy efficient fluorescent light bulbs that always lit up the courtyard at night to keep out burglars were not burning. That is unusual, he thought to himself. He returned to the bedroom, woke up his wife, Moitri, and asked her whether she had forgotten to switch them on before going to bed. She mumbled she hadn't, pushed off the quilt and climbed out of bed. The couple stepped out onto the verandah which ran alongside two bedrooms on the ground floor of their squat two-storied house in the city of Muzaffarpur. Now, lit by torchlight, what they saw sent chills down their spine. The two doors in the closed verandah that overlooked the courtyard were ajar. Fear woke them up completely. The panicked mother ran into the adjoining bedroom where their 12-year-old daughter Navaruna had gone to sleep. The frail and shy girl had spent the day at home. She had applied henna on her hands, watched cartoons on TV and had bread and milk for dinner before calling it a night. The lights went on. A tidily arranged silk shawl, a crumpled pillow and the mosquito net on the antique bed were in their place. But the bed itself was empty. \"She's not here, she's not here!\" Mrs Chakravarty screamed into the night. Navaruna Chakravarty disappeared on the night of 18 September 2012, a Tuesday. Or was it in the wee hours of 19 September? The girl 'vanishes' Investigators believe at least one person wriggled into her room after wrenching open the rotting iron bars of her bedroom window - it overlooked a dingy lane that was the main path used to access the house. He had possibly gagged and sedated the sleeping girl. Woken up violently, she had urinated in fright, leaving a wet patch on the sheets. Then he had carried her out to the verandah. Investigators believe the abductor opened the two doors from inside the house to let more people in. They had helped carry the girl out through an opening in the back of the house - the front door was locked from inside. There was a vehicle waiting on the main road, a few yards away. The girl and her abductors vanished into the drizzly night. Navaruna's parents believe she's still alive and her captors are at large. Investigators believe she's dead but concede the captors are still roaming free. A month after the incident, police arrested three men, including a distant, estranged relative of the Chakravartys. The police said the three \"seemed that they were hiding something\", but found nothing incriminating to implicate them in the crime. They were released after nine months in prison. On 26 November, local people found some skeletal remains in a neatly wrapped plastic bag in a fetid open drain close to the Chakravarty home. The family remembers there was some commotion, as municipal workers came, took out the bag and handed it over to the police. Bone examination Later that day, police told the family that they had found their daughter's bones. The parents refused to believe them and asked: Where's the evidence? The following month, a state hospital carried out a forensic examination of the bones \"attached to decomposed muscles and tissues\" - a collarbone, a long upper arm long bone, bits of femur and tibia. Doctors took away a molar tooth, a rib, a part of the thoracic vertebrae - a group of a dozen small bones that form the vertebral spine in the upper trunk - and some decomposed thigh muscles for DNA tests. The examiner concluded that the bones \"are of human in nature and belong to an individual, of a female, about 13-15 years of age who died 10 to 20 days before the date of receiving\" the remains. The cause of death \"could not be ascertained\". The examiner said clothes found on \"the decomposed body are suggestive of [a] teenage female\". The forensic doctor had examined a few bones - and certainly not a body - that arrived in a small box. The box also contained a black top, orange-and-white striped underwear and a black skirt, which the \"body\" was apparently wearing. The Chakravartys have always believed that the bones do not belong to their daughter, and that the bag was \"planted\" in the drain. They agreed to DNA tests in 2014, but they say the results have not been shared with them. \"If the bones are indeed of my daughter, why are investigators not sharing the results of the DNA tests?\" wonders Mr Chakravarty. The federal crime fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which took over the probe in 2014, said what had happened was a \"blind kidnapping-cum-murder case\". And the motive appeared to be a feud over the house in which the family has lived for decades, and from where Navaruna was taken away in the middle of the night. Lawless city Muzaffarpur, a teeming, exhausted city in one of India's poorest states, is known for cheap clothes, lacquered bangles and gangsters. Murders and abductions for ransom are common. Many are over plots which rival \"land mafias\", as they are called here, try to grab or buy cheap using coercion and fear. The streets are filled with dread for unescorted women who say they are stalked and harassed by men with impunity. The Chakravartys had been long planning to sell their century-old tumbledown house in a congested but prime neighbourhood and move out of the city. Mr Chakravarty, now 66, is a retired pharmaceutical sales representative. A fortnight before the kidnapping, he had signed an agreement to sell his property - the six-room house, a courtyard filled with palm, coconut and guava trees, a disused well and a small outhouse - for some 30 million rupees ($410,000; £320,000) to a local realtor, and accepted an advance of a little more than two million rupees. As word of the impending sale swirled around the town, Mr Chakravarty says he came under pressure to cancel the deal and sell the house to a rival realtor. Even local policemen came home and asked him, he says, to cancel the deal. \"It was clear that the local police was in cahoots with a gang that wanted me to cancel the deal and sell it to another party. I was holding out. Then my daughter disappeared.\" With her abduction, the house effectively became a crime scene, and the process of selling it ground to a halt. Over the next few years, police questioned Navaruna's family, relatives, friends and teachers. They searched the Chakravarty residence, and took away two of her diaries. One, according to the police, had some photographs and stickers, while in another she had apparently \"written about the qualities of a Dream Boy\" without naming him. (They were clearly pursuing an unsuccessful \"elopement\" angle at the time.) They even inspected a septic tank in her house to check for any human remains, to rule out an \"honour killing\". Teams fanned all over India, keeping an eye on crowded bus stands and railway stations. Police even staked out a hostel in Delhi where the couple's eldest daughter lived. 'Police involvement' Mobile phone records of at least 100 people, including the family and the original suspects, were examined. Data from hundreds of thousands of phones from mobile towers of half a dozen telecom providers were examined for chatter in the neighbourhood on the night of the kidnapping. Raids were conducted at various places, including a local red-light district, to rule out trafficking. \"We have made sincere efforts to track down Navaruna. We have made intense examinations. We have carried out scientific investigations,\" the police told the court. The investigation clearly appeared to have hit the buffers. Last month, the CBI told the Supreme Court that it had arrested six more suspects in April, questioned them for eight days and remanded them to judicial custody for 90 days before the court released them on bail. They had searched their homes and offices and found nothing suspicious. But in a significant twist, the sleuth agency said it had questioned three senior police officers who were directly connected with the investigation when the incident happened. In a report submitted to the top court last month, the agency said the first investigating officer and the head of the Muzaffarpur police station \"have to go through narco tests and brain mapping test\". \"Truth drug\" test results have never been admissible in Indian courts but police say they have provided leads. In the tests, a suspect is injected with sodium penthanol, a chemical that numbs powers of perception and supposedly makes it difficult for a person to lie during questioning. 'Don't play games' The agency also spoke about the \"deceptive response\" of the main policemen investigating the case, and pledged to explore the \"bureaucrat-mafia nexus\" in the crime. Waiting for their daughter has taken a grim toll on the Chakravarty family. A heart patient, Mr Chakravarty nearly overdosed on sleeping pills after spending sleepless nights waiting for his daughter. Every day, for two years after the incident, Mrs Chakravarty would visit the local police station and demand answers from the officer in charge. \"Don't play games with me,\" she would tell the policemen. \"Give me my daughter back.\" Over the years, Mr Chakravarty has turned from a grieving father to an angry, obsessive detective, trying to find clues about Navaruna's disappearance. He has recorded four gigabytes of phone conversations with police officials on his mobile phones and \"mysterious calls\" he says he received from different parts of India until a month after his daughter's disappearance. \"I even heard my daughter's muffled voice in some of them,\" he says. In his clear handwriting and in finely-vivid detail, he has written five exhaustive diaries, detailing his conversations with investigators. He's begun writing a book on the case, and has already completed 170 pages. He has written letters to politicians, judges, and the prime minister and president of India. He has personally visited the state's chief minister Nitish Kumar and complained about the snail-paced investigation. He reads aloud obsessively from the diaries, almost enacting the scenes and intoning the voice of the detectives, as if to tell the world: \"Listen to me. I know who's behind the kidnapping. Why is no one taking me seriously?\" More from Soutik All this is triggered, says Mr Chakravarty, by a sense of guilt, grief and vengeance. There's guilt over his failure to protect his daughter; grief at her prolonged disappearance and vengeance \"against the system which conspires to delay justice to common people\". \"How can I go on living here like this,\" says Moitri Chakravarty. \"How long can you live in this house of memories? When she returns home, we will leave the place.\" The crumbling house is an oppressive museum of memories, carrying the full weight of darkness and tragedy. The Chakravartys seem to have even stopped cleaning the room that Navaruna spent most her time in, lest a speck of memory vanishes with the dust. \"Navaruna is everywhere, around us. Just look around and you will feel her presence,\" says Mrs Chakravarty. Her school uniform - the maroon tie and skirt, the white cap - is packed inside a string basket which hangs on the wall outside. Her maroon cotton towel, now mouldy with age, hangs outside the door, untouched since she disappeared. In a corner stands a pink cycle which her father bought for her 20-minute ride to the convent school. In the room, a glazed-glass cupboard is full of the missing girl's possessions. Plastic dolls gaze eerily through the dust. A small red purse with 200 rupees lies in a corner. The printed school schedule is pasted behind the door. A folded study table lies in a corner. In the room where she went missing, her pink dress hangs on a fraying clothesline; a white vest is strung up near the main door. On the dressing table she shared with her mother, her tube of moisturizer is untouched. On her father's table, which she would sometimes use, there's a faded pink whistle, painting books with drawings of young girls and cartoon characters. And there are strips of medicine tablets that her father takes every day to keep his blood pressure in control and protect his heart. It is a house of suffering and pain. \"Navaruna is coming back. So we have kept her things in place\", Ms Chakravarty says, welling up. \"She's 18 now. I wonder how she looks.\"",

    "text": "By Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi He didn't get tested for coronavirus. Instead he took anti-fever medication for five days. But the fever persisted, and soon he had difficulty breathing. His family asked him to get tested, but he refused. His rationale was that there was no way he could have contracted Covid-19 because he had hardly stepped out of his house in Delhi, and he had not met anybody who had the virus or was even suspected of having it. Eight days after the symptoms first appeared, his condition deteriorated. He was rushed to hospital, where he tested positive. \"I survived, but doctors told me that any more delay in hospitalisation could have cost me my life,\" he says. Mr Kumar hasn't been able to track the source of his infection and is still unsure how he caught it. Experts say there are many such cases - proof that \"full-blown\" community transmission is happening in India. But the government refuses to accept that community transmission has begun, saying there is no clear definition of the term, and each country can define it based on local conditions. So far, Kerala and West Bengal are the only two states to accept that they have entered this stage. But global understanding on the subject is simple: when the source of infection can't be traced in a large number of cases, it's safe to define it as community transmission. The WHO's guidelines say the same: \"community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases\". This is certainly happening in India, according to Dr Arvind Kumar, chairman of the Centre for Chest Surgery at Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital. He says that more and more patients are turning up at hospitals whose source of infection cannot be traced. And, he adds, the rising case numbers support this. India has recorded more than 1.2 million cases and nearly 29,000 deaths. \"These stats don't lie,\" Dr Kumar says. \"You have state after state where infection rates are going up rapidly. There is no point in denying what is right in front of you.\" But the government disagrees. A top doctor from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) recently acknowledged that India was in the community transmission phase, but the IMA retracted the statement two days later, saying it was the doctor's \"personal opinion\". The turnaround baffled many. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says the government needs to listen to doctors and experts, and acknowledge the evidence. There is no denying that the virus is more widespread now than a month ago. More states - such as Andhra Pradesh and Bihar - and more districts beyond dense urban areas are now reporting a surge in cases. Many of them were not prepared because they largely relied on quarantining and testing people coming from other states to halt the spread. But they did not take enough steps to curb the spread locally. Even the former strategy had gaps, because it's not possible to completely man porous borders between states. And many states also lack the means to track and test each person entering their territory. Dr Jameel adds that there was a sense that the virus could be contained within big cities and certain hotspot states, preventing it from reaching other parts of the country. \"That hasn't happened and now Covid-19 is spreading unchecked,\" he says. The virus is travelling fast, often leaving no trace to establish the chain of transmission. Dr Jameel points out that the government's own survey showed that 40% of the respondents who had respiratory illnesses did not know how they got sick. \"We have enough evidence to accept there is community transmission,\" he says. But experts say this didn't happen overnight. Rather, it happened over several weeks as the government continued to deny it. \"We had localised community transmission in early stages of the pandemic. But now it's spread across the country, it's there for everybody to see,\" Dr Kumar says. So why is the government so reluctant to accept the obvious? Experts say they \"can only guess\" since the government hasn't said much on the matter, and has not released an official definition of the term to support its stance. One reason could be that the government sees accepting the existence of community transmission as a failure of its policies. The government can't be blamed for community transmission, argues Dr Jameel, adding that it needs to be more forthright with data and accept what science proves. He adds that community transmission is often a possibility with such a highly infectious virus in densely populated countries like India. Denials only add more pressure, say experts, and spark an unnecessary debate around the topic. And the argument is pointless now, according to leading epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant, who has worked with the government. He says \"we have to keep improving our strategy\", whether we call it community transmission or not. \"India is a large country - you may control the virus in one state and then another state will flare up. So, we really don't need a definition to understand the ground reality,\" he says. \"It's getting worse, and that is the harsh truth.\" But accepting community transmission may require significant policy changes. The WHO says \"individual case identification, contact tracing, and quarantining are no longer necessary\" in a \"large-scale community transmission scenario\". Instead it advises countries to focus on tracking the geographical spread of the virus through data and deploy healthcare facilities accordingly. Dr Kant says it's possible that the government may not want to announce a shift in policy at the moment. Possibly because it's taken months for governments - both federal and state - to ramp up testing, and to implement test and trace protocols. The other challenge is that the pandemic is in different stages in different parts of India, which makes it difficult to overhaul the policy altogether. \"But it still doesn't justify their constant denials. They need to say what their long-term approach is or what their definitions are about community transmission,\" he adds. The public has a right to know, Dr Kant says, and the government should be transparent.",

    "text": "The former Mexico City mayor pledged on Saturday to end corruption and impunity to transform the nation on behalf of the poor and marginalised. The 65-year-old, popularly known by his initials Amlo, won a landslide victory in July - his third presidential bid. The political veteran begins his six-year term with approval ratings of 56%. His predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto leaves office with only 24% - his administration was plagued with corruption scandals and murder rates reaching record-high levels. President López Obrador inherits an immediate foreign policy issue - what to do about the thousands of Central American migrants camping on the US-Mexico border. Foreign dignitaries including US Vice-President Mike Pence, first daughter Ivanka Trump and Bolivian President Evo Morales attended the inauguration in the capital. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro did not attend the swearing-in ceremony, at which protesters unfurled a banner reading \"Maduro, you're not welcome\", but did go to a dinner hosted by Amlo. British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who Mr López Obrador considers a close friend, was also present. Mr López Obrador - whose leftist National Regeneration Movement party (Morena) will lead a coalition government - later took part in a traditional indigenous ceremony in Mexico City's Zócalo square. What did Amlo say? \"We will carry out a peaceful and orderly but also deep and radical transformation,\" the silver-haired leader said in his first speech to Congress. \"Because we will put an end to the corruption and impunity that are blocking Mexico's rebirth.\" Mr López Obrador reiterated many of the populist pledges he made during his campaign, tackling crime, poverty and corruption. He intends to rule frugally - selling Mexico's presidential plane, not living in the presidential palace, and by cutting his own salary by 60%. Mexico has privatised almost every part of its economy over the past three decades and Amlo vowed to reverse what he called disastrous neo-liberal economic policies of his predecessors. He promised that he would \"never seek re-election\" and more surprisingly, announced his intention to promote a recall referendum during his administration, allowing voters to remove an elected official through a direct vote. \"I no longer belong to myself, I belong to you, I belong to the people of Mexico,\" the new president said. New hope for Mexico Will Grant, BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent To chants of \"Presidente\" and \"Yes we could!\" inside the chamber, Andres Manuel López Obrador received the presidential sash from the outgoing President Enrique Peña Nieto. There has undoubtedly been a sea change in Mexican politics but whether he will truly be able to effect a change in Mexico remains to be seen. It certainly won't be easy given the extent to which such problems are endemic in the country's politics and society. However, the new presidential approach was clear from the moment Amlo left his home to attend the ceremony. He travelled in the same aging Volkswagen he has driven for years while Mr Peña Nieto was in the usual armoured convoy. Crowds also flocked to watch the ceremony at the official residence of Los Pinos, which President López Obrador has refused to live in and has instead turned into a public museum. His thousands of supporters have gathered in the main square in Mexico City to celebrate a moment many thought would never come: the one-time political outsider now crowned as the new hope for change in Mexico. First act President López Obrador has signed an agreement with three Central American counterparts to create a plan to stem the flow of migrants seeking asylum in the US, the Associated Press reported. Mexico's foreign ministry said the plan included a fund to generate jobs in the region. In the Mexican border city of Tijuana, more than 6,000 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador face months of waiting for their asylum claims to be processed. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries and have travelled more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) for a chance at the American Dream.",

    "text": "Sammy Wanaina received a text message on Sunday asking him to provide the secret personal code so that his Sim card could be swapped. He was confused, he had not asked for a new card - and just moments earlier he had terminated a call that he now realised must have been from a fraudster who had posed as a customer services adviser from the phone company. \"It was a brief call and I did not give any of my details,\" Mr Wanaina told the BBC. He immediately contacted Safaricom, his mobile provider, to report that he suspected that there was an ongoing attempted fraud on his number. Despite not giving out his details - and reporting the fraud to Safaricom - he completely lost access to his number and only getting back control after three days. He tweeted that the whole experience had scared him. Mr Wanaina says Safaricom contacted him after his complaint and issued him with a new Sim card as a precaution - without giving further details about how he lost access to his number. The company tweeted him to say it was \"committed to safeguarding customer information and... that we will follow up this matter to its conclusion\". 'I lost $18,000' His story prompted others to share their experiences - many of whom had lost money in the scam. Politician Stanley Wanjiku revealed that he had been trapped by the fraudsters, losing $18.000 (£14,000). He told the Daily Nation newspaper that his trouble started after he received a notification that he could not access his mobile wallet and had to call a certain number to reset it - which he did. He later learned that his Pin number has been replaced and a new one regenerated, so he could not get access to his money. The paper did not say which service he had his account. \"I do not know how my mobile money Pin was regenerated and issued to strangers. I am at a loss how they identified themselves,\" Mr Wanjiku said, adding that a bank account not linked to his mobile phone was also hacked. More on mobile money: People tend to have several Sim cards from different companies - as they have different coverage and deals. This means Sim cards do get damaged, so it's not unusual for customers to want to replace them. Kenya has the highest number of users of mobile money in the world, a major reason why the recent Sim card fraud has caused such public alarm. Almost half of its 47 million population use the dominant M-Pesa platform to pay for services and conduct businesses. Through partnerships, phone companies have also managed to integrate mobile money services with banks, allowing customers to seamlessly move money back and forth. William Makatiani, from the cyber-security consulting firm Serianu, told the Daily Nation that the scam to hack into mobile phones is becoming more common. \"Sim swapping has become a big problem especially in Nigeria since 2016. It started picking up in Kenya in the last half of last year,\" he was quoted as saying. How to protect yourself It is not clear how exactly the scam is working, but this week the Communication Authority of Kenya, the body that regulates the mobile phone industry, told users to be on their guard: Safaricom also urged customers to safeguard their passwords, dates of birth and national identity numbers. It also said that subscribers should be aware of its official customer care number so as not to be duped by those trying to get access their account.",

    "text": "By Rebecca ThomasEntertainment reporter Her subsequent fight for survival and renewed vigour on recovery have proved an inspiration to millions around the world. Her courage has won her the Nobel Peace Prize and led to her becoming one of those rare individuals who can go by their first name alone. But behind her international profile is one of a normal teenager - and a daughter of a loving, united and inspirational family. It's this story, seemingly mundane yet so fundamental to who Malala is, that fascinated director Davis Guggenheim - maker of the Oscar-winning portrayal of US Democratic politician Al Gore in An Inconvenient Truth - and led to his latest documentary He Named Me Malala. Guggenheim uses one-to-one interviews, news footage and animation to paint an intimate portrait of the Yousafzais's past and present - and in particular the influence of Malala's father Ziauddin on her life. The director explains: \"People in the Swat Valley were being killed for standing up to the Taliban but there was this young girl who decided she was going to stand up to them. \"People don't fully understand this vital element of her story or where that determination comes from. \"My first instinct in making this movie was that it is very much about a family, about a father's love and about a girl who feels empowered to do amazing things. \"If you cover that story, it speaks to girls all over the world.\" Guggenheim filmed the Yousafzai family - Malala, her parents and two younger brothers - over 18 months. Much of the film takes place at the family's home in Birmingham, where they stayed following Malala's treatment at the city's hospital. But Guggenheim also shows Malala on trips to the Middle East and Africa as part of her work for the Malala Fund - an education charity she established with her father - visiting schools, refugee camps and addressing world leaders. Guggenheim is himself passionate about the importance of education and has made documentaries on the US school system. And as a father to two girls, he seems the perfect candidate to enter Malala's world - but it didn't prevent the nerves that preceded their first encounter. \"I was walking on eggshells,\" he says. \"But they were just hilarious and joyful. They tease each other and I found them remarkably enlightened and infinitely curious. I would leave their house invigorated. \"They have a certain freedom from having risked their lives and Malala lives her life even more fearlessly - the little things in life just disappear.\" Malala's brothers Khushal, 15, and Atal, 11, are lively boys, dreaming of glorious futures and tirelessly jibing and arguing with their sister. \"Look Malala, one day I will be an astronaut and a great sportsman and you will be known as my sister,\" says Atal. Her mother Toor Pekai is barely visible on camera due to her Pashtun sense of modesty but, says Guggenheim, she is \"100% in control. When a big decision is being made all eyes turn to her\". And Malala emerges as a just a normal teenager, struggling to get the best grades at school and bashfully doe-eyed over Roger Federer. It's an endearing picture but what truly stands out in this family story is Malala's bond with her father, who very visibly supports her in everything she wants to do. It's an attachment that began even before Malala was born. In Pakistan, Ziauddin belied his slight physique and the difficulties of a stammer to become a passionate social activist and a teacher, even establishing his own school. In a patriarchal society in which \"women are not known in public and their names are only known to family members\", he was adamant his daughter would be different and named her after a legendary 19th Century Pashtun warrior heroine, Malalai of Maiwund. \"Malalai had had a voice and I wanted my Malala to have the same - that she would have freedom and be brave and be known by her name,\" says Ziauddin. And it was immediately apparent she was special, he says. \"I hesitate to romanticise or make it something superstitious by saying she was born a saint or prophet but I felt an immediate attachment to her. I saw a light in her eyes. \"She was very mature and sensible and mindful of others and was loved by the whole community.\" Ziauddin put himself at considerable risk through his activism and received threats from the Taliban as a result. It caused Malala extreme anxiety yet she continued with her own activism and famously wrote a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, about life in the Swat Valley. Though acknowledging he was a role model for his daughter, Ziauddin says he feels no guilt for what ultimately happened to her. \"Guilt comes from when you do something sinful. When your basic human rights are violated and you don't stand up, that's a sin,\" he says. \"I didn't push my daughter; if I had she would have stopped. She would have said: 'Father you put me in a very bad situation, I got hit by a bullet, I am not going to do it anymore for you'. \"But she became more resilient, more committed and I've never heard her utter a single sigh or a single word which implies complaint or regret.\" And Malala - who has been left with some paralysis in her face and impaired hearing - vehemently backs her father. \"My father only gave me the name Malalai. He didn't make me Malalai. I chose this life,\" she says. As for the future, Ziauddin shows characteristic defiance. He is sure the family will go back to Pakistan for good, he says, despite the welcome and freedom they are all grateful to have received in the UK. And he has faith that his daughter will know the right path for herself to tread. Guggenheim fully agrees. \"When you do the DNA of Malala, she is a potent mix of both her parents. She gets her sense of mission from her father but her moral fibre, her religious clarity and forgiveness from her mother,\" he says. \"Anything is possible for Malala. She is wholly equipped to be a leader and she is completely unique in that, when the big decisions are being made about girls education, she is the only young person at the table. \"She's a voice for all those girls who don't have a voice. She'll be that for a very long time.\" He Named Me Malala opens in the UK on 6 November.",

    "text": "Takahiro Shiraishi, dubbed the \"Twitter killer\", was arrested in 2017 after body parts were found in his flat. The 30-year-old had admitted to murdering and dismembering his victims - almost all of whom were young women he met on the social media platform. The serial killings triggered debate over how suicide is discussed online. More than 400 people turned up to watch the verdict on Tuesday, despite the court only having 16 seats available for the public, reported local media. Public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan, one of the few developed nations to retain capital punishment. How did he find his victims? Shiraishi used Twitter to lure suicidal women to his home, saying he could help them die and, in some cases, claimed he would kill himself alongside them. He strangled and dismembered eight women and one man aged 15 to 26 between August and October 2017, said Japan's Kyodo news agency, citing the indictment. The serial killings first came to light on Halloween that year when police found dismembered body parts in Shiraishi's flat in the Japanese city of Zama, near Tokyo, while they were searching for a missing 23-year-old woman, who turned out to be one of the victims. After she had gone missing, her brother accessed her Twitter account and alerted police to a suspicious handle, leading them to Shiraishi's residence on the morning of 31 October in 2017. Japanese media called it the \"house of horrors\" after investigators discovered nine heads along with a large number of arm and leg bones stashed in coolers and tool boxes. What happened at the trial? While prosecutors sought the death penalty for Shiraishi, his lawyers argued he was guilty of the lesser charge of \"murder with consent\", claiming his victims had given their permission to be killed. Shiraishi later disputed his own defence team's version of events, and said he killed without their consent. On Tuesday, Judge Naokuni Yano, who delivered the verdict, called the crimes \"cunning and cruel\", and found the defendant \"fully responsible\" for his actions. \"None of the nine victims consented to be killed, including silent consent,\" public broadcaster NHK quoted the judge as saying. \"It is extremely grave that the lives of nine young people were taken away. The dignity of the victims was trampled upon.\" Shiraishi told the court last month that he did not plan to appeal against his sentence if found guilty. It was not immediately clear if that remained his plan. The death penalty is carried out by hanging in Japan, which has more than 100 prisoners on death row. Death row inmates are not told when they will be put to death until the day of their execution. Years usually pass between sentencing and an execution being carried out. Who were the victims? The names of those Shiraishi murdered were withheld to protect their privacy. The father of one victim, aged 25, told the court last month that he would \"never forgive Shiraishi even if he dies\", according to Japanese broadcaster NHK \"Even now, when I see a woman of my daughter's age, I mistake her for my daughter. This pain will never go away. Give her back to me,\" he had said. On Tuesday, the father of another victim, who was 17, told NHK the death sentence was \"appropriate\". \"I feel like I want to get revenge, but bereaved families can't do anything. I don't know how to vent my anger,\" he said. The brother of a 25-year-old victim said his \"heart died\" when he heard Shiraishi's testimony. \"It didn't sound at all like he regretted it... It felt like I was being hurt with a sharp knife over and over again.\" The man Shiraishi killed was a male friend of one of his female victims, who was seeking her whereabouts. What impact has the case had? The killings stunned Japan, triggering fresh debate about suicide and how to help those considering it, as well as about websites where suicide is discussed. The government has indicated it may introduce new regulations. Summing up, the judge said the case had \"provoked great anxiety in society, because social networks are so commonly used\". The murders also prompted a change by Twitter, which amended its rules to state users should not \"promote or encourage suicide or self-harm\". Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey called the case \"extremely sad\". Japan has long battled one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world. Figures have dropped since preventative measures were introduced more than a decade ago but there have been signs that rates have been rising again during the coronavirus pandemic.

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The company has also extended the range to include a new \"Mini\" model that has a smaller 5.4in screen. The US firm bucked a wider industry downturn by increasing its handset sales over the past year. But some experts say the new features give Apple its best opportunity for growth since 2014, when it revamped its line-up with the iPhone 6. \"5G will bring a new level of performance for downloads and uploads, higher quality video streaming, more responsive gaming, real-time interactivity and so much more,\" said chief executive Tim Cook. There has also been a cosmetic refresh this time round, with the sides of the devices getting sharper, flatter edges. No charger The higher-end iPhone 12 Pro models also get bigger screens than before and a new sensor to help with low-light photography. However, for the first time none of the devices will be bundled with headphones or a charger. Apple said the move was to help reduce its impact on the environment. \"Tim Cook [has] the stage set for a super-cycle 5G product release,\" commented Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. He added that about 40% of the 950 million iPhones in use had not been upgraded in at least three-and-a-half years, presenting a \"once-in-a-decade\" opportunity. In theory, the Mini could dent Apple's earnings by encouraging the public to buy a product on which it makes a smaller profit than the other phones. But one expert thought that unlikely. \"Apple successfully launched the iPhone SE in April by introducing it at a lower price point without cannibalising sales of the iPhone 11 series,\" noted Marta Pinto from IDC. \"There are customers out there who want a smaller, cheaper phone, so this is a proven formula that takes into account market trends.\" The iPhone is already the bestselling smartphone brand in the UK and the second-most popular in the world in terms of market share. If forecasts of pent up demand are correct, it could prompt a battle between network operators, as customers become more likely to switch. \"Networks are going to have to offer eye-wateringly attractive deals, and the way they're going to do that is on great tariffs and attractive trade-in deals,\" predicted Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. Apple typically unveils its new iPhones in September, but opted for a later date this year. It has not said why, but it was widely speculated to be related to disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The firm's shares ended the day 2.7% lower. This has been linked to reports that several Chinese internet platforms opted not to carry the livestream, although it was still widely viewed and commented on via the social media network Sina Weibo. Ceramic shield Apple said the iPhone 12 has the same 6.1in (15.5cm)-sized screen as its predecessor, but it now uses OLED rather than LCD technology for richer colours. This has also helped the firm make the device 11% thinner and have smaller bezels. It added that the screen was also higher resolution and used a \"ceramic shield\" to protect its display to offer \"four times better drop performance\". A new A14 Bionic chip - the first to be built on a five nanometre process - is being used to carry out more advanced enhancements to photos. The firm said it would deliver night-mode selfies without using the flash, as well as better deal with colour, contrast and noise in challenging settings. It showed off a forthcoming mobile version of League of Legends as an example of the \"console-quality games\" it could now run smoothly. The addition of a magnet array inside the phone's back will allow compatible chargers to \"snap on\" and renew the battery more quickly, as well as accessories including a wallet to be held in place. The iPhone Mini shares these features but in a smaller form. \"The Mini is an interesting move from Apple, which I would have expected [to come] next year - but the smaller phone trend is clearly picking up,\" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies. The iPhone 12 will start at £799 - a £70 gain on last year - and go on sale on 23 October. The iPhone 12 Mini will start at £699 and be released on 13 November. Depth sensor Two steel-sided higher-end models have also been redesigned to feature bigger displays - the iPhone Pro goes from 5.8in to 6.1in, while the Pro Max goes from 6.5in to 6.7in. They carry over the improvements made to the lower-end devices. But they also gain a Lidar (light detection and ranging) scanner. This creates depth-maps of the immediate environment, making autofocus in dim settings \"up to six times faster\". It can also be used for augmented-reality tasks, although these were given less emphasis. The Pro Max's wide-angle rear camera lens has also been given a bigger sensor to improve low-light performance. Both new Pro models now have at least 128 gigabytes of storage and are £50 cheaper than last year's devices, starting at £999 and £1,099. 5G follower Samsung first launched a 5G-enabled Galaxy S10 phone back in February 2019, and Huawei, OnePlus and Google are among others to have added the capability too. But experts say there has only been limited interest in the feature to date. \"Apple is rarely the first to launch new technologies but waits for a technology to be mature enough to build new customer experiences on top of it,\" commented Thomas Husson from the research company Forrester. \"I think we're slowly reaching this tipping point.\" Apple said it had tested its devices at peak 5G speeds of 3.5 gigabits per second - which means a 20 gigabyte 4K movie could be theoretically downloaded in about 45 seconds. However, it warned that users' experiences would vary by network and region, and the 5G facility would not always be switched on. \"The ability of the iPhone 12 to switch between 5G and 4G when the consumer needs, in order to preserve battery, does highlight that 5G connectivity clearly isn't necessary 100% of the time for consumers,\" remarked Stephen Mears from the consultancy Futuresource. The UK was the second European nation to start rolling out 5G. But while this has helped give it a lead, coverage remains sporadic. In the US - Apple's largest market - 5G speeds are particularly slow. In fact, according to one study, downloads over Canada's 4G networks are typically faster, In some countries, 5G has not yet become available to the public. However, in China - Apple's second-biggest market - the government has encouraged its rapid deployment, and recently announced both Beijing and Shenzhen had achieved \"full coverage\". \"There's no question that a large part of Apple's decision to settle a legal dispute with [5G modem chip-maker] Qualcomm was predicated on the fact that it couldn't afford not to have 5G in 2020,\" Mr Wood told the BBC. \"China would have been the driving force behind that. \"But there will also have been pressure from major operators across the world who are investing heavily in 5G networks and recognise the fact that the iPhone is a strategically important product.\" The really interesting announcements here all came down to speed: 5G-ready phones with faster chips inside them. But Apple arguably failed to sell what you can actually do with all this power. The one area it will definitely help with is mobile gaming, with quicker response times for multiplayer titles as well as better graphics. And what else can 5G do? Well it could let you watch sporting events from multiple angles on your phone - one example the firm gave was of watching American football from seven camera feeds. Or - using augmented reality - you could design a room with virtual furniture in real-time. But as the chief of US network Verizon noted during a guest spot during the presentation: \"Until now most people have taken a wait-and-see approach to 5G.\" And the question is whether the public saw anything that would make them want to rush out and add it to their lives now. Moreover, 5G networks in most countries are at best patchy - you won't be able to take advantage of the promised speed gains in many places. In time, there are likely to be popular apps and games that are dependent on the tech. And many gadget enthusiasts will be tempted to upgrade to an iPhone 12 or Android equivalent to be ready. But they will be investing in the promise of what's to come, rather than what they can do today. Smart speaker Apple also launched a new version of its smart speaker - the HomePod Mini. It supports a wider range of voice commands than before as well as introducing a home intercom system. The £99 voice-controlled device also adds a facility that detects when an iPhone is nearby to produce visual and vibration effects that simulate the effect of music flowing between the gadgets. The first HomePod was launched in 2018, and has lagged far behind Amazon and Google's rival speakers to date. There was no mention, however, of a Mac computer set to run off the A14 chip. Nor was there mention of Bluetooth-based tracking tags or over-ear headphones, which have both been rumoured to launch soon. This will likely lead to speculation that Apple will hold a further event before the end of 2020.",

    "text": "The bronze sculptures represent some of Hinduism's most revered deities - Lord Ram, his wife Sita and his brother Lakshman, all part of the same set of idols. They belong to a 15th Century temple built during the Vijayanagara empire, located in Anandamangalam village in Tamil Nadu state, and were stolen in 1978. Vijayanagara was once one of the most important trading centres in the world. It's taken years of work by a group of art enthusiasts, investigations by police teams in two countries, and efforts from Indian diplomats in the UK, to help bring them back. Four years ago, a photograph of one of the sculptures was spotted on the website of the British Antique Dealers' Association by a member of India Pride Project, which works to bring stolen idols back to India. S Vijaykumar, who co-founded the project, says: \"We identified it as a Vijayanagara bronze, but could not work out if it was an idol of Lord Ram or Lakshman, as there are subtle differences in the posture [of the deities].\" The group knew there were some historic temples in southern India that had similar sets of idols, with the sculpture of Lakshman missing. So, they set out to try and see if the photographed sculpture matched such a set. \"We got leads [which took us] to districts and temples with similar styles, but we could not come up with any firm matches for three years,\" says Mr Vijaykumar. Then, last year, one of the group's volunteers in London, while looking for Indian antiques on sale, found a grainy photo of a similar looking bronze, but with a different crown. That's when it struck them, that they might be looking at a case where the whole set of idols was stolen. They restarted their search, and found a crucial piece of the puzzle in the archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry in southern India. A photograph taken on 15 June 1958, showed the full set of idols in the Sri Rajagopala Swamy Temple in Anandamangalam village. Armed with evidence, the group approached the High Commission of India in the UK. In September 2019, Indian officials passed on the information to the Metropolitan Police to ensure the idols were not sold while sufficient proof was being gathered. Police say they contacted the dealer who had advertised the sculpture, and \"established he was a good faith purchaser and hadn't committed any criminal offences\". In India, detectives from the Idol Wing of the Tamil Nadu police were sent to the village. Locals confirmed that sculptures from the temple had indeed been stolen. But for hard evidence, the team had to search through hand written records in stacks of files stored at the local police station. By January this year, the police found what they were looking for. A complaint registered on 24 November 1978, showed that the theft had taken place the night before. They also found judicial records which showed that three men had been convicted for this theft, and other similar crimes, in 1988. Sources in the Tamil Nadu police have told the BBC they were given a prison sentence of nine months, and the main accused had said he sold the idols to people he didn't know. How the sculptures were smuggled out of India and into the UK remains a mystery. According to the Metropolitan Police, once the dealer was satisfied that the sculpture was a match, he voluntarily offered to return it. What's more, he also had two other idols from the same set. The handover was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but it finally happened on 15 September. According to the High Commission of India in the UK, the idols will be repatriated within the next few days. But the set is still incomplete. There is a fourth idol of the monkey god Hanuman, who according to Hindu mythology, is an ardent devotee and companion of Lord Ram. Indian officials have told the BBC this sculpture is suspected to be in a museum in Singapore. If the idols had been sold, they might have fetched millions of dollars. \"To me, they are priceless. They were never meant to be objects of art. They are meant to be worshipped. It's important for collectors and dealers to recognise that these sacred bronzes have been stolen from temples which continue to exist,\" says Mr Vijaykumar. \"It pains the original custodians to see their gods being reduced to showpiece curios.\" With additional reporting by Shalu Yadav",

    "text": "Lawmakers voted unanimously in favour of a resolution that \"Pakistan should maintain neutrality\" in Yemen. Saudi Arabia had asked Pakistan last month to contribute ships, aircraft and troops to the campaign to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Meanwhile, two planes have delivered relief supplies to Yemen's capital. The aircraft were carrying medicines, bandages and surgical equipment from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN Children's Fund (Unicef). The organisations had to wait days before receiving clearance from all sides in the conflict for the flights to Yemen, where the UN says basic services are unravelling, with widespread food and fuel shortages. 'Proactive role' Pakistan's parliament began debating whether to join the coalition on Monday. Although Saudi Arabia is an ally, many lawmakers spoke out against sending troops to Yemen. Friday's resolution backed the Pakistani government's commitment to protect Saudi territorial integrity and Islamic holy places located inside the kingdom. \"The parliament of Pakistan expresses serious concern on the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and its implications for peace and stability of the region,\" the resolution said. \"[It] desires that Pakistan should maintain neutrality in the Yemen conflict so as to be able to play a proactive diplomatic role to end the crisis.\" Analysis: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Saudi Arabia has been a major foreign donor to Pakistan - some say perhaps the third-largest after the US and China. Late last year, for example, what finance minister Ishaq Dar initially described as a $3bn (£2bn) \"gift from a friendly source\" turned out to be Saudi largesse that was used to stabilise a free-falling rupee against the US dollar. Soon afterwards Pakistan officially backed the Saudi position on Syria. So some resentment in Saudi quarters is to be expected from this vote. But Pakistanis have still left room for a troop deployment in Saudi Arabia if not in Yemen, which Saudis will certainly need if the conflict in Yemen drags on for longer. There is a precedent for this. During the first Gulf War in 1991, Pakistan deployed two brigades to \"defend holy sites\" in Saudi Arabia. The only other example of a Pakistani troop deployment abroad is to Jordan during the \"Black September\" of 1970, to help that government put down a Palestinian insurgency. The coalition of nine mostly Sunni Arab states is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" against the Houthis, a Zaidi Shia rebel movement that the US and Saudi Arabia allege is receiving military assistance from regional Shia power Iran. Analysts say Pakistan, which has a Sunni majority but also a sizeable Shia minority, fears being caught between the two if it sends troops to Yemen. Earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif travelled to Islamabad to urge Pakistan's leaders to reject the Saudi request. 'Humanitarian pause' The rebels and allied army units loyal to Yemen's ousted former President Ali Abdullah Saleh took full control of Sanaa in January and placed Mr Hadi under house arrest. He escaped and took refuge in Aden in February, but left the country at the end of March when the Houthis reached the outskirts of the southern port city. More than two weeks of air strikes have failed to halt the Houthi advance into Aden, as well as neighbouring southern and eastern provinces. Overnight, coalition aircraft targeted the defence ministry building in Sanaa and weapons storage sites. On Thursday, the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator for Yemen called for a humanitarian \"pause\" in the bombardment and fighting on the ground to allow in urgent aid deliveries. Johannes van der Klaauw told reporters in Geneva that the conflict had now spread to 15 of Yemen's 22 provinces. He described the situation in Aden in particular as \"catastrophic\", a descent into urban warfare, with control of the air and seaports shifting daily between rival groups. A million people in the city risked being cut off from access to clean water within a matter of days unless additional fuel is brought in, he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says almost 650 people have been killed and more than 2,200 have been injured since 19 March, but Mr van der Klaauw said the actual number of casualties was likely to be far higher because many were not being brought to hospital or were being buried immediately. Who is fighting whom in Yemen? Houthis - The Zaidi Shia Muslim rebels from the north overran Sanaa last year and then expanded their control. They want to replace Mr Hadi, whose government they say is corrupt. The US alleges Iran is providing military assistance to the rebels. Ali Abdullah Saleh - Military units loyal to the former president - forced to hand over power in 2011 after mass protests - are fighting alongside the Houthis. Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - The president fled abroad in March as the rebels advanced on Aden, where he had taken refuge in February. Sunni Muslim tribesmen and Southern separatists have formed militia to fight the rebels. Saudi-led coalition - A US-backed coalition of nine, mostly Sunni Arab states says it is seeking to \"defend the legitimate government\" of Mr Hadi. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - AQAP opposes both the Houthis and President Hadi. A rival affiliate of Islamic State has also recently emerged.",

    "text": "The temple in Kerala barred women of a \"menstruating age\" - defined as between the ages of 10 and 50 - from entering. Menstruating women are not allowed to participate in religious rituals or enter temples, as they are considered \"unclean\" in Hinduism. The ruling came after a petition argued the custom violated gender equality. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it is one of a few temples that does not allow women in the broad age group to enter at all. Millions of devotees visit Sabarimala every year. In the judgment Chief Justice Dipak Misra said that \"religion is for one dignity and identity\", adding that \"the right to practise religion is available to both men and women\". The impending retirement of Justice Misra has seen a flurry of historic liberal rulings from the court in recent days, including the striking down of colonial-era laws that criminalised adultery and gay sex. Justice Misra, who will retire on Tuesday, was heading a five-judge bench which gave a 4-1 verdict. The BBC's Soutik Biswas says such a stream of judgements leading up to a judge's retirement in the top court is not unusual. \"But what it also underlines is that the 25 judges of the court are some of the most overworked in the world - one study found that a single Supreme Court judge, during his tenure over four to six years, hears some 6,000 cases alone,\" our correspondent adds. Indu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, dissented with the majority verdict. \"Issues of deep religious sentiments should not be ordinarily interfered by the court... Notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion,\" she said in her dissenting opinion. 'God does not discriminate' Analysis by Geeta Pandey, BBC News For centuries, temples and shrines have cited tradition to keep women out and their managements, dominated mostly by patriarchal men, have used menstruation to keep female devotees away. But in recent years, they have faced an unprecedented challenge from women's groups. Friday's order, which accepts womens' right to worship at Sabarimala, is expected to help remove some of the stigma associated with periods. The order has not come as a surprise - Chief Justice Dipak Misra had previously questioned the validity of the practice, saying that since God does not discriminate between genders, who are we to do that? Also, in the past two years, courts have unlocked the gates of Shani Shingnapur temple and Haji Ali mosque for women. Three years ago, the Sabarimala temple chief said he would allow women to enter the shrine only after a scanner was invented to detect if they were \"pure\"- meaning they weren't menstruating. Today, the judges have told him that we won't be needing that scanner anymore. The state government of Kerala had opposed the entry of women when the case was first taken up in 2016. However it changed its stance in a recent hearing to support the petitioners instead. At a hearing in July, petitioners argued that this custom violated equality guaranteed under India's constitution. They added that it was prejudiced against women and their right to worship. But supporters of the ban argued that the practice had been in effect for centuries, and there was no need to change it now. The campaign to repeal the ban on women entering the temple gathered momentum in 2016 after a protest by female students. One of the protesters also started a #HappyToBleed campaign on Facebook against \"sexist attitudes\", which received support from different parts of the country. Nikita Azad, who started the campaign, told the BBC this is a historic judgement. \"It will have a large impact since the Supreme Court has destigmatised menstruation and upheld equality over religion,\" she said. This is the third religious site in India where women have gained the right to enter through judicial intervention. Courts directed authorities of the Hindu temple Shani Shingapur and the Muslim Haji Ali shrine, both in the western state of Maharashtra, to allow women inside. What is the significance of the Sabarimala temple? Sabarimala is one of the most prominent Hindu temples in the country. Millions of devotees from all over the world visit the temple to seek blessings. To enter the temple, pilgrims have to climb 18 holy steps. According to the temple's website, the act of crossing these 18 steps is so sacred that no pilgrim can climb them without undertaking a rigorous 41-day fast. Devotees are also supposed to follow specific rituals before they enter the shrine. Some of them include pilgrims wearing only black or blue and not being allowed to shave until the completion of their pilgrimage. As part of the ritual, they also smear sandalwood paste on their foreheads.",

    "text": "By Caroline ParkinsonHealth editor, BBC News website They had 10 fewer cases of heart disease and three more strokes per 1,000 people compared with the meat-eaters. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at 48,000 people for up to 18 years. However, it cannot prove whether the effect is down to their diet or some other aspect of their lifestyle. Diet experts said, whatever people's dietary choice, eating a wide range of foods was best for their health. What does this study add? It analyses data from the EPIC-Oxford study, a major long-term research project looking at diet and health. Half of participants, recruited between 1993 and 2001, were meat-eaters, just over 16,000 vegetarian or vegan, with 7,500 who described themselves as pescatarian (fish-eating). They were asked about their diets, when they joined the study and again in 2010. Medical history, smoking and physical activity were taken into account, Altogether, there were 2,820 cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 1,072 cases of stroke - including 300 haemorrhagic strokes, which happen when a weakened blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain. The pescatarians were found to have a 13% lower risk of CHD than the meat-eaters, while the vegetarians and vegans had a 22% lower risk. But those on plant-based diets had a 20% higher risk of stroke. The researchers suggested this could be linked to low vitamin B12 levels but said more studies were needed to investigate the connection. It is also possible that the association may have nothing to do with people's diets and may just reflect other differences in the lives of people who do not eat meat. So does it show vegan and vegetarian diets are unhealthy? Dr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetic Association, says not - because this was an observational study. \"They looked at what people ate and followed them for years, so it's an association, not cause-and-effect,\" she says. \"The message, for everyone, is it makes sense to have a well-planned diet, and to eat a wide variety of foods. \"Meat-eaters don't necessarily have a varied diet, because they might live on meat and potatoes for dinner every night and not have any vegetables.\" Has what people eat changed since this study started? Researchers did go back to participants in 2010 to ask them again about their diets. But Dr Phillips says vegan and vegetarian diets will have changed. \"This is data that's been collected from a couple of decades ago,\" she says. \"It might well be that the typical vegetarian diet today looks very different to a vegetarian or vegan diet from 20 or 30 years ago. \"The range of vegetarian and vegan convenience foods has escalated massively. It's a lot more mainstream.\" And we know more about the health risks linked to eating too much processed and red meat, which has been linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer.. So what should go on my plate? The NHS's the Eatwell Guide sets out the balance of foods you need, whatever kind of diet you eat: But people on vegan and vegetarian diets also need to take particular care to consume enough of some specific nutrients. For example, people who eat meat, dairy and fish usually have enough vitamin B12, needed for healthy blood and nervous systems. However, vegans can become deficient, though B12 is also present in foods such as fortified breakfast cereals and yeast extract spreads. Iron is also less easily absorbed from plant-based foods, so those who choose not to eat meat need to ensure they include foods such as wholemeal bread and flour, dried fruits and pulses. And there was a call last month for vegans to be aware of the need to ensure they were consuming enough of another nutrient, called choline, important for brain health.",

    "text": "He was viewed by his subjects as a stabilising influence in a country that saw numerous military coups during his reign. Despite being seen as a benign father figure who remained above politics, he also intervened at times of heightened political tension. And although he was a constitutional monarch with limited powers, most Thais regarded him as semi-divine. Bhumibol Adulyadej was born in Cambridge in the US state of Massachusetts on 5 December 1927. His father, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, was studying at Harvard when his son was born. The family later returned to Thailand, where his father died when he was just two years old. His mother then moved to Switzerland, where the young prince was educated. As a young man he enjoyed cultured pursuits, including photography, playing and composing songs for the saxophone, painting and writing. The status of the Thai monarchy had been in decline since the abolition of its absolute rule in 1932, and there was a further blow when his uncle, King Prajadhipok, abdicated in 1935. The throne passed to Bhumibol's brother, Ananda, who was just nine years old. Figurehead In 1946, King Ananda died in what remains an unexplained shooting accident at his palace in Bangkok. Bhumibol acceded to the throne when he was 18 years old. His early years as king saw Thailand ruled by a regent, as he returned to his studies in Switzerland. While on a visit to Paris he met his future wife, Sirikit, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France. The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before the new monarch was crowned in Bangkok. For the first seven years of his reign, Thailand was ruled as a military dictatorship and the monarch was little more than a figurehead. In September 1957, Gen Sarit Dhanarajata seized power. The king issued a proclamation naming Sarit, military defender of the capital. Under Sarit's dictatorship, Bhumibol set about revitalising the monarchy. He embarked on a series of tours in the provinces, and lent his name to a number of developments, particularly in agriculture. For his part, Sarit reinstated the custom that people crawled on their hands and knees in front of the monarch. and restored a number of royal ceremonial occasions that had fallen into disuse. Overthrow Bhumibol dramatically intervened in Thai politics in 1973 when pro-democracy demonstrators were fired on by soldiers. The protesters were allowed to shelter in the palace, a move which led to the collapse of the administration of then-prime minister, Gen Thanom Kittikachorn. But the king failed to prevent the lynching of left-wing students by paramilitary vigilantes three years later, at a time when the monarchy feared the growth of communist sympathies after the end of the Vietnam War. There were to be further attempts to overthrow the government. In 1981, the king stood up to a group of army officers who had staged a coup against then prime minister, Prem Tinsulanond. The rebels succeeded in occupying Bangkok until units loyal to the king retook it. However, the tendency of the king to side with the government in power caused some Thais to question his impartiality. Bhumibol intervened again in 1992, when dozens of demonstrators were shot after protesting against an attempt by a former coup leader, Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, to become prime minister. The king called Suchinda, and the pro-democracy leader, Chamlong Srimuang, to appear in front of him, both on their knees as demanded by royal protocol. Suchinda resigned and subsequent elections saw the return of a democratic, civilian government. During the crisis that erupted over the leadership of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006, the king was frequently asked to intervene but insisted this would be inappropriate. However, his influence was still viewed as pivotal when the election Mr Thaksin had won that April, was annulled by the courts. Mr Thaksin was eventually deposed in a bloodless coup, in which the military pledged their allegiance to the king. In the years that followed, the king's name and image were invoked by factions both for and against Mr Thaksin, as they jostled for power. The entire country joined lavish celebrations to mark King Bhumibol's 80th birthday in 2008, reflecting his unique status in Thai society. Reverence Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power in a coup in May 2014 and was made prime minister by the military-appointed parliament a few months later. He promised far-reaching political reforms to prevent a return to the instability of recent years. But critics suspected his real priority was to destroy the party of Mr Thaksin and to ensure that the royal succession took place smoothly. The public reverence for King Bhumibol was genuine but it was also carefully nurtured by a formidable public relations machine at the palace. There were harsh \"lese-majeste\" laws that punished any criticism of the monarchy and which restricted the ability of foreign and domestic media to fully report on the king. During his long reign, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was faced with a country continually racked by political upheaval. It said much for his skills as a diplomat, and his ability to reach out to ordinary people in Thailand, that his death leaves the country's monarchy far stronger than it was at his accession.",

    "text": "By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Kabul How did we get here? And why did it take so long? The Afghan war has been a bloody stalemate for years now, with the Taliban increasingly controlling or contesting more territory, yet unable to capture and hold major urban centres. There seems to have been a growing realisation, both amongst the group's leadership and in the US that neither side is capable of an outright military victory. President Trump, meanwhile, has been clear about his desire to withdraw American troops from the country. One key concession by the US, which allowed negotiations to take place, was the decision in 2018 to change its longstanding policy that the Taliban should talk first of all to the Afghan government, who the insurgents dismiss as illegitimate. Instead the US sat down directly with the Taliban to address their chief public demand - the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. Those negotiations led to Saturday's accord, with the Taliban agreeing in exchange to address the core reason for the US invasion in 2001, the group's links to al-Qaeda. This deal now opens the door to separate, wider talks between the militants and other Afghan political leaders - including government figures. Those discussions will be much more challenging. Somehow there will have to be a reconciliation between the Taliban's vision of an \"Islamic Emirate\" and the democratic modern Afghanistan that has been created since 2001. Where does that leave women's rights? What is the Taliban's stance on democracy? These are questions that will only be answered when the \"intra-Afghan talks\" begin. Up until now, the Taliban have been, perhaps deliberately, vague. There are possible obstacles even before those talks begin. The Taliban want 5,000 of their prisoners released before they start. The Afghan government wants to use those detainees as a bargaining chip in the talks to persuade the Taliban to agree to a ceasefire. Then there's the ongoing political dispute over the results of the presidential election - with Ashraf Ghani's rival Abdullah Abdullah alleging fraud. A backdrop of political instability could make it harder to establish the \"inclusive\" negotiating team international observers want to see sitting across the table from the Taliban. One Afghan official admitted to me that even when they start, the \"intra-Afghan\" negotiations could take years. But the US has signalled its intent to withdraw all its forces within 14 months if the Taliban fulfil their side of the agreement. It is not immediately clear if that means the US will stay on beyond that time, if no settlement has been reached. Afghan officials have emphasised the pullout is \"conditional\", but one diplomat told me withdrawal was only contingent on the \"intra-Afghan talks\" starting, not concluding. He expressed concern that if the US were to pull forces out and the Taliban decided to up the ante on the battlefield, Afghan forces would be left extremely vulnerable. Other analysts have warned that the Taliban doesn't appear to be in the mood for concessions, presenting the agreement today to their supporters as a \"victory\". The Taliban do however appear to want international legitimacy and recognition. The fanfare around the ceremony in Doha has given them that, and they may feel negotiations offer the best chance of achieving their aims. The priority for many ordinary Afghans, at least in the short term, is a substantive reduction in violence. We'll find out in the coming weeks, when the warmer spring weather generally heralds the start of \"fighting season\", if that will happen.",

    "text": "By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst, Norway The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the west coast of the US, where waters are deep. \"This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,\" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles (25km) off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. \"I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,\" said Mr Delp. How big? The jaw-dropping dimensions of the technology used: The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78m deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. Price drop The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The £190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: \"Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. \"We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem.\" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

    "text": "A report by UN human rights investigators says that 40 officials may be individually responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It says civilians have been tortured and mutilated, and villages destroyed on an industrial scale. Conflict between government factions has continued in South Sudan despite a peace deal signed in 2015. Of the 40 senior officials identified as potentially responsible for atrocities, five are colonels and three are state governors. They have not been named by the report, but their identities could be made public at trial at a later date. The UN says the testimony gathered from survivors is \"devastating\", including some people being forced to rape family members \"in cases reminiscent of Bosnia\". One woman said her 12-year-old son was forced to have sex with his grandmother, in order to stay alive. The same woman also saw her husband being castrated. Another man saw his companion, a man, gang raped and left for dead in the bushes. \"Sexual violence against men in South Sudan is far more extensive than documented\", says the head of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, Yasmin Sook. \"What we see so far is likely just the tip of the iceberg.\" Another survivor, a pregnant woman in Lainya County, says she saw suspected opposition supporters being detained, tortured and then decapitated by SPLA fighters. She was kept with the victims' decomposing bodies. One of them was her husband's. \"There is a clear pattern of ethnic persecution,\" says Commissioner on Human Rights in South Sudan Andrew Clapham. He adds it is \"for the most part by government forces, who should be pursued for crimes against humanity\". The plan is to take the evidence of crimes against humanity to a new hybrid court which is due to be set up by the South Sudanese authorities in partnership with the African Union. But the problem is South Sudan's government is unlikely to ever set up the court because its own military allies are thought to be some of the main culprits, reports the BBC's Will Ross. South Sudan's government spokesman says it needs to \"investigate the reality\" of the UN's report because \"most of those types of reports are cut and paste\". But Ateng Wek Ateng also told the BBC: \"We take this report seriously. \"We would want the UNHCR to furnish us with information leading to the arrest of those 40 officials and we will make sure those 40 are brought to book.\"",

    "text": "IS said the men were soldiers captured in the city of Homs. They were shot dead inside Palmyra's amphitheatre. Stills from the video showed the killers to be young males, possibly even as young as 13 or 14. IS captured Palmyra and the neighbouring modern city, locally known as Tadmur, in late May. The video was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. It is not clear when it was filmed. The killings took place on a stage in the amphitheatre in front of a large black IS flag. Several hundred men in civilian clothes are filmed sitting on steps watching the shootings. Among them was a young boy. In close-up shots of the men waiting to be killed, they appear to have been beaten on the face. Days after IS claimed Palmyra, it executed 20 men in the same amphitheatre. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says shootings took place in the amphitheatre on 27 May, but it is not clear if those killings are the ones in the video. The video goes on to show the destruction of Tadmur prison, which occurred in late May. In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria's head of antiquities, said: \"Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.\" Mr Abdulkarim said most of the museum's antiquities had been transferred to Damascus before IS approached the city. Since then, there have been reports that mines have been planted among some of Palmyra's ruins, and there were claims this week that militants destroyed an ancient sculpture outside Palmyra's museum. Since capturing the city, IS has also taken control of a military airbase and a notorious prison nearby. The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. Fighters with IS started claiming vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, aided in part by the insecurity generated by Syria's civil war. More than 230,000 Syrians have died in the war, which began after President Bashar al-Assad's forces tried to put down anti-government protests in March 2011.",

    "text": "The men were convicted over the deaths of at least 11 officers in Kerdasa. The attack took place after Egyptian military forces cracked down on Islamist supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi that July. Hundreds of death sentences have been passed on Mr Morsi's supporters but none has been carried out. Human rights group Amnesty International says the death sentences follow grossly unfair trials and highlight Egypt's disregard for national and international law. Mr Morsi will face a new espionage trial on 15 February, Egypt's official Mena news agency says. He and 10 others will be charged with leaking \"classified documents\" to Qatar and Qatari-based broadcaster al-Jazeera. Mr Morsi is already facing three other trials, including another case of espionage. He too could be given the death penalty if found guilty. Appeal still possible More than 140 of the 188 defendants in the Kerdasa case are already in custody, while the rest have been sentenced in absentia. The court also sentenced a minor to 10 years in prison in the case, and two other defendants were acquitted. The verdict follows a recommendation by Egypt's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, but it can be appealed against. Last month, the death sentences of 37 people were overturned on appeal. The defendants had been convicted of attacking a police station in Minya, south of Cairo, on the same day as the Kerdasa attack. The violence came after security forces killed hundreds of people when they cleared protest camps set up in the capital by supporters of the ousted Islamist president, Mohammad Morsi. The original trial also saw some 377 people sentenced to life in prison in absentia. \"[The] death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the Egyptian criminal justice system,\" Amnesty's Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, said in a statement in response to Monday's verdict. \"These verdicts and sentences must be quashed and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and excludes the death penalty.\" Mr Sahraoui said it would be wrong to impose capital punishment \"when there are serious doubts hanging over the fairness of the trial\" which \"outrageously flouted\" international law. The United Nations has called the mass trials \"unprecedented\". Mr Morsi was succeeded by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, a former military chief who has been heavily criticised for his crackdown on Islamists. Hundreds of people, mostly Islamists, have been killed since the army deposed Mr Morsi.",

    "text": "TV footage showed the first miner, who was blindfolded to protect his eyes from the light, being lifted out as emergency workers cheered. The fate of 10 other miners remains unknown, as rescue operations continue to try to locate them. The entrance tunnel to the Hushan gold mine in Shandong province collapsed after an explosion on 10 January. A total of 22 miners were trapped in the blast, the cause of which is unknown. At least one died, and it is still not known if the remaining workers are alive underground. The first miner was brought to the surface on Sunday morning. He was blindfolded to protect his eyes from the light and was immediately taken to hospital for treatment, with his condition described as \"extremely weak\". About an hour after his rescue, 10 more miners were brought out from a different section of the mine. CCTV said one of the miners among this group was injured. Several others were seen walking by themselves, supported by rescue workers, before being transported to hospital. Rescue efforts have been sped up significantly, as a tunnel that was being bored out to reach the trapped miners was expected to take weeks to dig. \"On Sunday morning, a huge obstacle blocking the well suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft, allowing rescue work to take a big step forward,\" lead rescue worker Du Bingjian told the state-run Global Times. This first man to be rescued had been trapped in a different part of the gold mine to the main group of 10 - who have been receiving food and medicine for days. The group told rescuers they had established communication with a lone miner about 100m below them, but had since lost touch with him. It is not clear if he was the first miner to be rescued or not. Authorities have been unable to communicate with the other miners who remain missing. Mr Du said it was not yet known when rescuers would be able \"to reach the Sixth Central Section [of the mine] where the missing miners are believed to be\". How have the miners survived this long? The entry into the mine was severely damaged and communication was cut off by unexplained explosion. For a week, there was no sign of life. Then, on 17 January, rescuers felt a pull on one of the ropes they were lowering into small shafts leading down into the dark. A paper note was then sent up on a rope from a group of 12 surviving miners - 11 trapped in one place and a 12th trapped further below. After that, the contact with the 12th miner was lost, while one of the group of 11, who had fallen into a coma after sustaining a head wound in the explosion, was confirmed dead on Thursday. A communication line was then established and food and medicine lowered to them through a narrow shaft. Trapped in the dark some 600m (2,000ft) underground, the survivors managed to keep in regular contact with the rescue teams. They received porridge and nutritional liquids, and a few days before their rescue, the miners requested a traditional meal of sausages. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. In September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing, also due to carbon monoxide. In December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people.",

    "text": "The RTS,S vaccine trains the immune system to attack the malaria parasite, which is spread by mosquito bites. Earlier, smaller trials showed that nearly 40% of the 5-to-17-month-olds who received it were protected. Malaria cases appear to be on the rise again after a decade of success in combating the deadly disease. \"This is a landmark moment for immunisations, malaria control, and public health,\" Dr Kate O'Brien, Director of Immunisation and Vaccines at the World Health Organization, told the BBC. According to the most recent annual figures, global malaria cases are no longer falling, sparking concerns about its resurgence. 435,000 died of malaria worldwide 219m infectedAfrica saw more than 90% of cases and deaths Malawi is the first of three countries chosen for the pilot to roll out the vaccine. It aims to immunise 120,000 children aged two years and below. The other two countries, Ghana and Kenya, will introduce the vaccine in the coming weeks. The three countries were picked because they already run large programmes to tackle malaria, including the use of bed nets, yet still have high numbers of cases. How big a problem is malaria? Malaria kills some 435,000 people around the world each year, the majority of them children. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250,000 children die every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr O'Brien said that malaria is \"a really difficult disease to develop a vaccine against\". An early trial of the vaccine began in 2009. \"There were seven countries participating in a large trial where over 15,000 children participated,\" Dr David Schellenberg, who has been working on the development of the vaccine with the WHO, told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"[The trial] showed pretty clearly that this vaccine is safe and it is efficacious in terms of its ability to prevent clinical malaria episodes and also severe malaria episodes,\" he said. What difference will the vaccine make? RTS,S has been more than three decades in the making, with scientists from drugs company GSK creating it in 1987. Years of testing supported by a host of organisations, including the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and costing an estimated $1bn (£770m), have led to this point. The nearly 40% efficacy is not high in comparison with vaccines for other diseases, but Dr Schellenberg says RTS,S will add to the preventative measures, such as bed nets and insecticides, already being used. \"Nobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet,\" Dr Schellenberg said. \"It may not sound like much but we're talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have good access to good treatment,\" he added. Dr O'Brien said the vaccine lasted for at least for seven years and would target infants because they are most at risk. The vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later. Dr Schellenberg accepted that it might be a challenge for mothers in some areas to take their children to clinics for all four doses. This stage of the trial is expected to be completed by 2023, according to Path.",

    "text": "\"Protecting these children, many of whom are refugees and internally displaced... must be a priority\", said the UN's children's agency Unicef. Despite deals with the Ethiopian government, humanitarian agencies say they are being denied access to Tigray. Government forces have been battling Tigray fighters since 4 November. The government says it is in control of the region and the conflict is over. But Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) says it is still fighting on various fronts. Hundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, while about 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan. In a statement, Unicef said: \"The longer access to [the children] is delayed, the worse their situation will become as supplies of food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel and other essentials run low.\" It added: \"We call for urgent, sustained, unconditional and impartial humanitarian access to all families in need wherever they are.\" Neither the Ethiopian government nor the TPLF have commented on the issue. What is the conflict about? The conflict escalated in November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray. He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray. The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of the TPLF - the region's dominant political party. For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined after Mr Abiy took office in 2018 in the wake of anti-government protests.",

His spokesman later said his remarks had been \"in jest\". Mr Duterte has previously said he killed criminal suspects as mayor of the city of Davao. The Filipino leader is attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, alongside regional leaders and US President Donald Trump. He has presided over a massive crackdown on crime in the Philippines, which critics allege undermines fundamental human rights. Mr Duterte has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drugs trade, and said he would \"be happy to slaughter\" three million drug addicts in the country. Addressing the Filipino community in Da Nang, he said he had killed a person during his violent teenage years, when he said he was in numerous fights and \"in and out of jail\". But a spokesman for the president, Harry Roque, told the AFP news agency that the remarks were \"in jest\" and the Filipino leader often used \"colourful language\" when addressing Filipinos overseas. Mr Duterte has previously said he possibly killed someone while a teenager. In 2015 he told the Philippines edition of Esquire magazine that during \"a tumultuous fight in the beach\" when he was 17, \"maybe I stabbed somebody to death\". It is not clear if he was referring to the same incident in his speech. He also claims to have thrown corrupt officials out of helicopters, warning officials he would do it again if they embezzled financial aid. His spokesman described that claim as an \"urban legend\". Speaking about human rights during his Vietnam visit, Mr Duterte proposed a \"world summit\" on the issue - but not looking solely at human rights abuses in the Philippines. \"What makes the death of people in the Philippines more important than the rest of the children in the world that were massacred and killed?\" the Manila Bulletin quoted him as saying. Since he took office, police say they have killed almost 4,000 people in anti-drug operations. More than 2,000 others have been killed in connection with drug-related crimes. In September, the proposed budget for the human rights commission investigating the deaths was cut to 1,000 pesos - the equivalent of $20 (£15). It had asked for 1.72bn pesos ($34m). Mr Duterte is due to hold bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump in the Philippines in the coming days - the first meeting between the pair. The Philippines president was adversarial towards Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, labelling him a \"son of a whore.\" Mr Obama cancelled their scheduled meeting.",

In a post on its own Facebook page, it appeals for Ms Kim to come forward so it can get to the bottom of the matter. It says it is only aware of the incident because of the posts on social media.

He ran the southern city for two decades, earning a reputation for cutting crime, and criticism for allegedly supporting death squads. Mr Duterte was speaking to business leaders at the presidential palace on Monday, before an overseas trip. It is the latest in a series of controversial and sometimes contradictory comments by Mr Duterte. 'Blood on his hands' \"In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys [police] that if I can do it why can't you,\" he said. \"And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also. I was really looking for a confrontation so I could kill.\" In 2015, he admitted killing at least three men suspected of kidnapping and rape in Davao. The comments have been condemned by human rights group Amnesty International, which has called on him to put an immediate end to the killings. \"The climate of impunity in the Philippines has intensified even further since President Duterte began his brutal crackdown on suspected drug users and dealers in July, with a wave of unlawful killings claiming more than 5,000 lives across the country,\" said Rafendi Djamin, the group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific. \"By boasting about the blood on his own hands, President Duterte will further embolden police and vigilantes to blatantly violate laws and carry out more extrajudicial executions without fear of being held to account.\" But just hours before Mr Duterte's latest remarks, he insisted \"I am not a killer\", in a speech for The Outstanding Filipino Awards 2016. He has also previously both acknowledged and denied being involved with death squads. In September a Senate inquiry heard testimony from a self-confessed former death squad member that Mr Duterte had, while serving as Davao mayor, shot dead a justice department agent with an Uzi submachine gun. Nearly 6,000 people are said to have been killed by police, vigilantes and mercenaries since Mr Duterte launched his drug war after being elected in May. He has expressed few regrets about the policy, once saying: \"Hitler massacred three million Jews... There's three million drug addicts. I'd be happy to slaughter them.\" Mr Duterte has repeatedly said he does not care about human rights and has suggested that lawyers defending drug suspects might also be targeted in his campaign, says the BBC's Jonathan Head.

    "text": "He is being investigated over his alleged role in the death of Anvay Naik, an architect who designed his studio. Mr Goswami and Republic TV network deny allegations that he owed money to Naik, who took his life in 2018. Mr Goswami approached the top court after a lower court denied him bail. A two-judge bench granted him interim bail after hearing his petition via video conference. \"We must send a message today to the high courts as well. Please exercise your jurisdiction to uphold personal liberty,\" Justice DY Chandrachud said. He was referring to Mr Goswami's allegation that he was being targeted over his journalism. Mr Goswami is a polarising figure whose contentious broadcasts have earned him loyal viewers as well as critics, many of whom accuse him of being sympathetic to right-wing politics in the country. His arrest has also divided opinion, with many alleging it was politically motivated. In recent months, he has been particularly critical of Mumbai police over their handling of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. He often accused them of being lenient in their investigation into the star's death. His criticism also often extended to the Maharashtra government, which is run by a coalition headed by the Shiv Sena party, a former regional ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But the speed with which Mr Goswami's case was listed - the lower court had denied him bail just two days before - also appeared to raise eyebrows, prompting one lawyer to write to the court. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave wrote that it was \"deeply disturbing\" how Mr Goswami's petition was listed \"instantly\" when \"thousands of citizens are languishing\" in jail, waiting for their cases to be heard for \"weeks and months\". What is the case against Mr Goswami? After Mr Naik killed himself, his wife accused Mr Goswami of not paying his fee. She said her husband had left a suicide note in which he blamed Mr Goswami for his death. She has been campaigning on social media for the case to be investigated thoroughly. Maharashtra state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh recently ordered a special team to look into the case. A police team arrested Mr Goswami from his home in Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, on 4 November. Images showed scuffles taking place between Mr Goswami and the police. Republic TV has accused the police of \"manhandling\" Mr Goswami's family members. But the police then accused Mr Goswami of misbehaving with them - they registered a police complaint against him for allegedly assaulting a female police officer. The Editors Guild of India urged the authorities to \"ensure that Goswami is treated fairly and state power is not used against critical reporting by the media\". A host of senior leaders and federal ministers belonging to the BJP have also criticised his arrest, saying it was \"an attack on the media's freedom of expression\". But the main opposition Congress party, which is a coalition partner of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, has accused the BJP of \"selective outrage\". The party said BJP ministers do not speak out when journalists are harassed and arrested by states where it's in power.",

Child sexual abuse has been in focus in recent months after the case of a 10-year-old rape victim who was forced to give birth hit the headlines. Two of her uncles were sentenced to life in jail for raping her. According to the report on crimes in India for 2016, released by Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi, 106,958 cases of crimes against children were recorded in 2016. Of these, 36,022 cases were recorded under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children in the world, but there is general reluctance to talk about the topic so the real number of cases could be much higher. According to a 2007 study conducted by India's ministry of women and child development, 53% of children surveyed said they had been subjected to some form of sexual abuse. Campaigners say most of the abusers are people known to the victims, like parents, relatives and schoolteachers.",

    "text": "The court also asked the government to respond within a month to a clutch of petitions challenging the law's constitutional validity. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed in December last year, prompting outrage and protests across India. The law offers citizenship to non-Muslims fleeing religious persecution from three nearby countries. Around 30 people have died in over a month of protests against the law. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court hinted that it may refer the law to a larger constitution bench in the future - but for now, it has only asked the government to reply to pending petitions. Several petitions argue that the law is illegal, claiming that it grants citizenship on the basis of religion - which goes against the country's secular values enshrined in its constitution. Those challenging this new law include political parties, civil society and Muslim groups. What is the law about? The act offers amnesty to non-Muslim illegal immigrants from three countries - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. It amends India's 64-year-old citizenship law, which currently prohibits illegal migrants from becoming Indian citizens. It also expedites the path to Indian citizenship for members of six religious minority communities - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian - if they can prove that they are from Muslim-majority Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. They will now only have to live or work in India for six years - instead of 11 years - before becoming eligible to apply for citizenship. The government says this will give sanctuary to people fleeing religious persecution, but critics argue that it will marginalise India's Muslim minority. Who is protesting and why? For more than a month, there have been numerous protests and demonstrations across Indian cities. Opponents say that faith cannot be made a condition of citizenship. But others protesting - particularly in border states - fear being \"overrun\" by new arrivals from the three neighbouring countries. Student demonstrations have dominated the protests but many of them have focused less on the law itself and more on the alleged police brutality against protesters. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh has seen the highest number of deaths.",

    "text": "Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent She lived in what was then the North-West Provinces with two disciples and a male lover, performing and accepting gifts at \"auspicious occasions\" like births of children and at weddings and in public. She had left her lover for another man before she was killed. British judges were convinced that her former lover had killed her in a fit of rage. During the trial they described eunuchs as cross-dressers, beggars and unnatural prostitutes. 'Moral panic' One judge said the community was an \"opprobrium upon colonial rule\". Another claimed that their existence was a \"reproach\" to the British government. The reaction was strange considering that a eunuch was the victim of the crime. The killing, according to historian Jessica Hinchy, curiously triggered British \"moral panic about eunuchs\" or hijras as they are called in South Asia. \"She was a victim of the crime but her death was interpreted as evidence of criminality and immorality of the eunuchs,\" Dr Hinchy told me. British officials began considering eunuchs \"ungovernable\". Commentators said they evoked images of \"filth, disease, contagion and contamination\". They were portrayed as people who were \"addicted to sex with men\". Colonial officials said they were not only a danger to \"public morals\", but also a \"threat to colonial political authority\". For nearly a decade, Dr Hinchy, now assistant professor of history at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, trawled the colonial archives on eunuchs that provided unusually detailed insights into the impact of colonial laws on marginalised Indians. The result is Governing Gender and Sexuality in Colonial India, arguably the first in-depth history of eunuchs in colonial India. Eunuchs often dress up like women and describe themselves as being castrated or born that way. A disciple-based community, it has important roles in many cultures - from sexless people guarding harems to singing and dancing entertainers. In cultures in South Asia, they are thought to have the power to bless or curse fertility. They live with adopted children and male partners. Today, many consider eunuchs transgender, although the term also includes intersex people. In 2014, India's Supreme Court officially recognised a third gender - and eunuchs (or hijras) are seen as falling into this category. Bhoorah was among the 2,500 recorded eunuchs who lived in the North-West Provinces - now India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand. Years after her murder, the provinces launched a campaign to reduce the number of eunuchs with the objective of gradually causing their \"extinction\". They were considered a \"criminal tribe\" under a controversial 1871 law which targeted caste groups considered to be hereditary criminals. The law armed the police with power of increased surveillance of the community. Police compiled registers of eunuchs with their personal details, often defining \"an eunuch as a criminal and sexually deviant person\". \"Registration was a means of surveillance and also a way to ensure that castration was stamped out and the hijra population was not reproduced,\" says Dr Hinchy. Eunuchs were not allowed to wear female clothing and jewellery or perform in public and were threatened with fines or thrown into prison if they did not comply. Police would even cut off their long hair and strip them if they wore female clothing and ornaments. They \"experienced police intimidation and coercion, though the patterns of police violence are unclear\", says Dr Hinchy. The community reacted by petitioning for the right to dance and play in public, and perform at fairs. The petitions, says Dr Hinchy, point to the economic devastation caused by the ban on dances and performances. In the mid-1870s, the eunuchs of Ghazipur district complained that they were starving. One of the most shocking moves of the authorities was to take away children who were living with eunuchs to \"rescue them from a life of infamy\". If eunuchs were living with a male child, they risked fines and jail. Many of these children were actually disciples. Others appeared to have been orphans, adopted or enslaved as children. There were also children of musicians who performed with eunuchs and appeared to have lived alongside them with their families. Some eunuchs even lived with widows who had children. British officials saw the children as \"agents of contagion and a source of moral danger\". \"Colonial anxieties about the threat that hijras posed to Indian boys overstated the actual number of children residing with the community,\" says Dr Hinchy. According to records, there were between 90 and 100 male children found living with registered eunuchs between 1860 and 1880. Very few of them had been emasculated and most of them were living with their biological parents. \"The short-term aim of the law included cultural elimination of the eunuchs through erasure of their public presence. The explicit, long-term ambition was limiting, and thus finally extinguishing, the number of eunuchs,\" says Dr Hinchy. \"To many high-ranking colonial officials, the small eunuch community endangered the imperial enterprise and colonial authority.\" The British also began policing other groups which didn't fit the binary gender categories - effeminate men who wore female clothing, performed in public and lived in kin-based households, men who performed female roles in theatre and male devotees who dressed as women. \"The law,\" says Dr Hinchy, \"was used to police a diverse range of gender non-confirming people.\" In many ways, the attitudes of the British and the English-speaking Indian elites to eunuchs echo aspects of Hindu faith that colonial rulers found abhorrent. Indologist Wendy Doniger has written about the British rejection of the sensual strains of Hinduism as filthy paganism. However, religion was not a factor in the colonial rejection of eunuchs - it was more about \"contamination\", \"filth\", their sexual practices and public presence. Yet, despite this dark history, eunuchs survived these attempts to eliminate them by evading the police, continuing to have a visible public presence and devising survival strategies. Dr Hinchy writes that they became skilful at law breaking, evading the police and keeping on the move. They also kept their cultural practices alive within their communities and in private places, which was not illegal. They also became adept at hiding property, so that police could not register it. Their success is clear by the fact that despite being often defined as deviant and disorderly, Dr Hinchy says eunuchs \"remain a visible presence in public space, public culture, activism and politics in South Asia\". In India, they continue to make a living by dancing at weddings and other ceremonies despite facing discrimination and living on the margins. Theirs is a stirring story of resilience and survival.

    "text": "Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were led away from court after the verdict. Australian Peter Greste was deported back to Australia earlier this year and was on trial again in absentia. The three are accused of aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood group but they strenuously deny the allegations. The three journalists were originally sentenced in July 2014, with Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy receiving seven years and Mr Mohamed getting 10 years. But their convictions were overturned in January this year and they were freed in February to await retrial. Giving the verdict on Saturday, judge Hassan Farid said the three men were not registered journalists and had been operating from a Cairo hotel without a licence. He handed three-year sentences to Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy but gave Mr Mohamed an additional six months. Reaction: Peter Greste speaks to the BBC It is unclear how long Mr Fahmy and Mr Mohamed will now serve. They were in prison for about a year before being freed. Lawyers for the three journalists are expected to appeal against the decision. The BBC's Lyse Doucet, who was in the court, said the verdict came as a shock to a room packed full of Egyptian and foreign journalists. The expectation was that the journalists would be found guilty, she adds, but that they would be given a lesser sentence and be allowed to walk free. 'Dangerous message' Mr Greste said in a tweet that he was \"shocked\" and \"outraged\" while Al-Jazeera said the verdict was \"yet another deliberate attack on press freedom\". Outside the courtroom, Mr Fahmy's lawyer, Amal Clooney, called on Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to issue a pardon to the journalists. \"The verdict today sends a very dangerous message in Egypt,\" she told reporters. \"It sends a message that journalists can be locked up for simply doing their job, for telling the truth and reporting the news.\" She said she would push for her client, who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, to be deported to Canada.",

    "text": "The 16-year-old is the youngest person to be chosen by the magazine in a tradition that started in 1927. Speaking at a UN climate change summit in Madrid before the announcement, she urged world leaders to stop using \"creative PR\" to avoid real action. The next decade would define the planet's future, she said. Last year, the teenager started an environmental strike by missing lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. It sparked a worldwide movement that became popular with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. Since then, she has become a strong voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world. Earlier this year, she was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. At the UN Climate Conference in New York in September, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. In a now-famous speech, she said: \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We'll be watching you.\" Reacting to the nomination on Twitter, the activist said: \"Wow, this is unbelievable! I share this great honour with everyone in the #FridaysForFuture movement and climate activists everywhere.\" The teenager's message, however, has not been well received by everyone, most notably prominent conservative voices. Before her appearance in Madrid, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro called her a \"brat\" after she expressed concern about the killing of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. \"Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon,\" Mr Bolsonaro told reporters. \"It's impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that,\" he said, using the Portuguese word for brat, \"pirralha\". The activist responded by briefly changing her Twitter bio to \"Pirralha\". She has previously been at odds with US President Donald Trump, who has questioned climate science and rolled back many US climate laws, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who once called her a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\". Announcing Time's decision on NBC, editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said: \"She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.\" The magazine's tradition, which started as Man of the Year, recognises the person who \"for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year\". Last year, it named murdered and imprisoned journalists, calling them \"The Guardians\". What happened in Madrid? At the COP25 Climate Conference in Madrid, Greta Thunberg accused world powers of making constant attempts \"to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition\". \"The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when, in fact, almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,\" she said, drawing applause. \"In just three weeks we'll enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future,\" she added. \"Right now, we're desperate for any sign of hope.\" A speech grounded in research This was meant to be a big moment in the talks, the elixir of the \"Greta effect\" bringing new energy to a flagging process. The teenager is almost certainly the most famous person here, attracting far more attention than other celebrities like Al Gore, and the UN badly needs a boost. Her talk came over as measured, grounded in the latest research, and avoided the flash of hurt and anger she displayed in New York in September. Looking around the hall, it was striking how many of the national delegations had not turned up for this morning session at the conference. A snub by the big fossil fuel economies? Or maybe they were too busy in the negotiations themselves? In any event, the passion among the millions of young people who have taken to the streets to demand action on climate change feels very remote from the diplomatic struggles in these halls. Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission - the EU executive - announced ambitious environmental proposals to cut the bloc's dependency on fossil fuels, hoping to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who took office on 1 December, called the European Green Deal Europe's \"man on the Moon moment\". It includes proposals that affect everything from transport and buildings to food production, and air and water pollution. The package will be debated by EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and includes: Reacting to the proposals, Jagoda Munic, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe, said they were \"too small, too few and too far off\", adding: \"We're on a runaway train to ecological and climate collapse and the EU Commission is gently switching gears instead of slamming on the brakes.\"",

    "text": "A warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. And US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said. The US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense. Tehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country. Iran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities. Why is the US sending additional forces? The Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats. The latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran. There are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq. The Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. Officials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities. The USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said. Iran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\". What's the state of US-Iran relations? Last year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Last month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass. Earlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed. It also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days. European powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse. Pressure or more? The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. In the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain. But Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran. The pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments. A difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

    "text": "Oleg Sokolov, 63, was rescued drunk from the Moika river in the city early on Saturday and was found to have a woman's arms in his backpack. Police later found other body parts further downriver and in his flat, identified as Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24. She had been living with him. He sobbed in court, saying: \"I repent\". Mr Sokolov was ordered into pre-trial custody for two months. In court he admitted shooting Ms Yeshchenko four times with a sawn-off shotgun, then chopping up the body with a saw and kitchen knife. A stun pistol was also found in the backpack. Divers are still searching for more remains: he is suspected of having dumped two more bags in the river. He sobbed so loudly in court that at one stage the judge adjourned proceedings. Mr Sokolov is a Napoleon expert who has received France's top state award, the Légion d'Honneur. He has written dozens of historical research papers, and Ms Yeshchenko, a postgraduate student, co-wrote some of them. He organised Napoleonic re-enactments - playing the role of Napoleon himself - and she participated. Mr Sokolov said the pair had been living together for five years, though other reports described it as a three-year relationship. The case has triggered outrage: women's rights activists say it illustrates widespread indifference towards sexual harassment and domestic violence in Russia. An online petition has collected more than 7,500 signatures, demanding that the managers of St Petersburg State University, where he lectured, be dismissed. It accuses them of having ignored previous students' complaints about Mr Sokolov. In court he alleged that Ms Yeshchenko had attacked him with a knife - and at that point he shot her - during a blazing row. \"This girl, who seemed like a beautiful ideal to me, turned into a monster,\" he alleged. He said she was jealous of his children from a previous marriage. Her parents rejected his version of events. The Kremlin has described it as a \"monstrous\" crime. President Vladimir Putin graduated from St Petersburg State University. The university has now dismissed Mr Sokolov and he has also been removed from a post at France's Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (Issep). Mr Sokolov was treated in hospital for hypothermia after rescuers hauled him out of the icy water on Saturday. Ms Yeshchenko was killed in his flat on Thursday night. Her head was found in the flat, as well as the shotgun, knives, an axe and ammunition, Russian media report. He is said to have planned to get rid of the body before publicly taking his own life dressed as Napoleon. A St Petersburg local councillor and former student of the professor, Vasily Kunin, has tweeted that he raised concerns about Mr Sokolov's previous behaviour but the university authorities did not act on his complaint. According to students, quoted by AFP, Mr Sokolov enjoyed speaking French, did impressions of Napoleon, and called Ms Yeshchenko \"Josephine\" and asked to be addressed as \"Sire\". Ms Yeshchenko moved to St Petersburg to study from Krasnodar region in southern Russia, and was a postgraduate student at the time of her death. \"She was quiet, sweet and always the ideal student,\" an acquaintance told Russia's RIA news agency. \"Absolutely everyone knew about their relationship.\" Russian media report that her mother is a police lieutenant colonel and her father a school PE teacher. A brother once played as a goalkeeper for the national junior football team. The papers here are full of details of this murder, the tragic and gruesome tale of a brilliant and beautiful young student shot and dismembered by her 63-year old former professor-turned-lover. In these accounts, Oleg Sokolov emerges as a historian whose interest in Napoleon bordered on the obsessive. He had a glittering CV as a respected expert on French military history, who had been visiting professor at the Sorbonne. He was also a major figure in the world of historical re-enactment. One friend told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper the professor had organised costume balls and picnics, as well as recreating battles. But organisations he's been linked to have now scrubbed his name from their websites. Anastasia Yeshchenko's affair with the married lecturer was common knowledge at the university. Friends say she was a top student, highly intelligent, who shared her lover's passion for Napoleonic history. One person described the professor as \"eccentric but not aggressive\"; others claimed he considered himself Napoleon reincarnated.",

    "text": "It comes as experts investigate a mystery lung disease across the US that is linked to use of e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 193 \"potential cases\" in 22 US states. Many of the cases involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, CDC experts said. The cases were reported over the course of two months between 28 June and 20 August. The person who died was \"hospitalized with unexplained illness after reported vaping or e-cigarette use\", Dr Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer and state epidemiologist in Illinois, said. CDC director Robert Redfield said: \"We are saddened to hear of the first death related to the outbreak of severe lung disease in those who use e-cigarette or 'vaping' devices.\" He added: \"This tragic death in Illinois reinforces the serious risks associated with e-cigarette products.\" What is the illness? The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all involve vaping in some form. \"In many cases, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing product,\" the CDC's head of non-infectious diseases, Dr Ileana Arias, said. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. But there is much that remains a mystery. \"It isn't clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations,\" Dr Arias said. There have been 22 cases in the state of Illinois, with patients ranging from 17 to 38 years old. The 22 states affected are largely in the centre and north-east of the country, from Minnesota to North Carolina, though cases have also been reported in California, Texas, and New Mexico. Officials have ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. A \"black market\" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. Is regular vaping safe? No cause for the mystery illness has been identified - and the link to THC products is not clear yet either. Mitch Zeller of the US Food and Drug administration said it was important to understand that \"we find ourselves in the early stages of these investigations trying to piece together the facts.\" He said the FDA was exploring whether the products were used as intended or being modified by adding something to them. The president of the American Vaping Association, Gregory Conley, said in a statement on Thursday that he was \"confident\" the illnesses were being caused by devices containing cannabis or other synthetic drugs, not nicotine. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. \"We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,\" he said. \"There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,\" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a \"buttery\" taste that has been linked to \"severe respiratory illness\". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. \"It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,\" he said. Dr King said it was possible \"we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to\". At least two people have previously died in the US after their e-cigarette exploded in their face.",

    "text": "A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in the data breach, according to reports. The kingdom's US embassy said the stories were \"absurd\" and called for an investigation into them. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who owns the Washington Post - worsened after one of the newspaper's staff was killed in a Saudi consulate. Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was murdered in Istanbul months after this alleged cyber-attack took place. In a blog post last year, Mr Bezos insinuated that the Saudi regime was unhappy with the \"the Post's essential and unrelenting coverage\" of the killing. \"It is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles,\" he wrote. Mr Bezos' phone was hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from Mohammed bin Salman's personal account, according to the Guardian newspaper which broke the story. An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone had started secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received an encrypted video file from the prince. The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy issued an outright denial of the claims. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The allegations are based on a report that was commissioned by the private security firm FTI Consulting, which was hired by Mr Bezos. Two UN officials are expected to make a statement about the credibility of the allegations later on Wednesday. Hacking 'horribly easy to do' Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter While the details of how this happened aren't yet public, evidence is pointing towards a WhatsApp conversation between the two men during which an infected video file was allegedly sent. It is unclear what the content of that video was, but there is huge interest in finding out what a crown prince might send to one of the world's most powerful tech leaders. Such a hack is \"horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,\" says cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone. From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps. Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year, a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files. Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments. But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities? The plot thickens. The reports come after private information about Mr Bezos was leaked to the American tabloid the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused the National Enquirer of \"extortion and blackmail\" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren Sánchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a \"long period\". An investigator for the Amazon founder later said Saudi Arabia was behind the National Enquirer leak and had accessed his data. \"Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos' phone, and gained private information,\" Gavin de Becker wrote on the Daily Beast website at the time. Mr de Becker linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.",

    "text": "By Virginia HarrisonBBC News For Sabrina Tan, leaving a tech career to break into the skincare industry brought plenty of challenges - including working with women. A female dynamic in the workplace was new to Sabrina, who grew up in Singapore with three brothers, and worked at male-dominated firms such as IBM, Oracle and Hewlett-Packard after leaving university. \"I was used to being one of the few women on the team,\" she says. Suddenly Sabrina was surrounded by many other females. She'd noticed that some were shy about sharing their ideas, and many felt unprepared, when, in fact, they were often over-qualified for the job. \"It was a huge change for me to move into beauty,\" she says. She took that step just over a decade ago with the launch of Skin Inc, a Singapore-based brand now sold in the US, UK, and across Asia, that rakes in tens of millions of dollars in revenue each year. The 45-year old credits her success to using a \"tech mindset\"- and drawing inspiration from her idol, the late Steve Jobs - to build a beauty company. \"I wanted to create the Apple of skincare.\" After studying business and economics at university in Singapore, Sabrina took her first job in tech, in a business development role. Over the years she found the frequent work travel stressed her eczema-prone skin. Highly allergic to substances like dyes, and affected by changes in the weather, Sabrina was frustrated and wanted solutions. Seeing her two young children also battle with eczema forced her into action. \"I thought this is crazy, we have to outsmart our skincare routine. The moment I skipped a step, it acts up again. \"I decided to take the matter into my own hands.\" So in 2007, she set off on a fact-finding mission to Japan. Sabrina wanted to search one of the world's biggest beauty markets for answers to why so many products had failed her. \"I started to talk to chemists and scientists. I went to drugstores, to beauty counters.\" The Japanese, she discovered, were passionate about ingredients. Eventually she found a lab that understood her hope of creating skincare products tailored to individual needs. The trip to Japan gave her confidence to place a huge bet on that vision. Her husband thought it was an \"interesting idea\", Sabrina remembers, but wondered how she was going to cope with two young kids. Still, she was determined, and they both quit their jobs and sank their life savings into the company. Sabrina says she wanted to \"give it her all\" or she would always wonder \"what if?\" A year later the first store opened in Singapore. With two toddlers and a business to build, she often slept just four hours a night. \"So many times I'd just sit in the car in our driveway and wonder, 'Am I doing the right thing?'.\" The years unfolded, and slowly the brand began to grow. The company, which sells serums, creams and high-tech beauty tools, opened two more stores. But it was six years before her fortunes were transformed, thanks to a distribution deal with global beauty powerhouse Sephora. The French giant - with its network of bricks-and-mortar and online stores - gave her huge exposure and access to customers. She says Sephora, which is owned by conglomerate LVMH, was interested in customised skincare, and that led one of its executives to visit a Skin Inc store. Sabrina remembers he described personalisation as a beauty \"megatrend\" that millennials were chasing, and welcomed her to the Sephora world. Skin Inc is now one of the top-selling Asian skincare brands on Sephora, she says. The Singaporean brand - which makes all its products in Japan - is available globally via its website. Retailers like US department store chain Nordstrom are also important, and later this year Skin Inc will launch in luxury stores Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Selfridges in the UK. Some of the brand's promises are familiar, such as beauty treatments for time-starved women. \"In Chinese we say there's no ugly women, there's only lazy women,\" Sabrina says. But technology is central to the brand. It helps Sabrina develop new products while guiding her thinking. The company - which has staff spread across Singapore, China and the US - has harvested customer data from more than a million \"skin checks\". It does this via online surveys. They use that pool of data - like how many women don't get enough sleep, or aren't exercising - to develop more personalised products. More The Boss features: Sabrina says: \"In tech we always have a troubleshooting mindset, we diagnose the problem and then go down to the core, to what will solve the problem.\" Sharon Kwek, senior beauty analyst for Asia-Pacific at Mintel, says Skin Inc's approach to individualised skincare was \"captivating\" when the business started out. \"At that point skin profiling and customisation wasn't so commonly explored. [Whereas] Skin Inc caters to every individual's skincare needs,\" she says, contrasting with mass brands that focus on one-size-fits-all products. So far Skin Inc has raised funding from investors in Hong Kong and Korea, on top of Sabrina's own initial investment. The next chapter could take the business in new directions. Fitness studios, wellness centres, and skincare vending machines, are among Sabrina's ambitions for the future. For now, her days are stacked with meetings touching every aspect of her company - from talking with suppliers, to developing social media strategies. She juggles early morning and late night calls around family time, as well as \"bonding with her team over red wine\". \"It's a great antioxidant for our skin!\"",

    "text": "Think tank the Resolution Foundation estimates 1% of adults, some 488,000 people, own 14% of the nation's assets - worth about £11 trillion. At the other end of the financial scale, 15% (7.3 million people) either own no assets at all, or are in debt. The government has responded to the findings by insisting that income inequality is at its lowest level since the mid-1980s. The Resolution Foundation says it is non-partisan and was founded in 2005, with \"the goal of improving living standards for the 15 million people in Britain on low and middle incomes\". 'Wealth gap' The foundation says the spreading of property wealth in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s fuelled a decade-long fall in wealth inequality - but that progress has since gone into reverse. The proportion of property wealth owned by the bottom four-fifths of adults grew from 35% in 1995 to 40% in 2005. However, the foundation warns \"that with home ownership steadily falling since its mid-2000s peak, the proportion of property wealth owned by the bottom four-fifths of the population has started to fall again\". \"Given the hugely unequal distribution of wealth across Britain, it's time we looked into how the nation's wealth is divided up and what the consequences are for those who never build up assets of any significance,\" said Conor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \"Falling levels of home ownership mean that, having once been a great force in driving down inequality, shifts in who owns what property are now fuelling the wealth gap between rich and poor, while also creating sharp wealth divides between young and old.\" 'More homes' A government spokesperson said: \"We want to build an economy that works for everyone. \"Income inequality is now at its lowest level since the mid-1980s and the lowest paid saw their wages grow faster than for 20 years. \"The next step is to get Britain building more homes and halt the decline in housing affordability. \"The Housing White Paper which sets out a bold package of reforms, following a £7.2bn investment at Autumn Statement, will help ensure more working people have the security of a decent place to live.\"",

    "text": "It is thought the vehicle came into the UK from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, a known route for people smuggling. Why are some ports unmanned? The lorry container in which the bodies were discovered arrived in the UK through the port of Purfleet, on the River Thames. It is among a number of the \"less busy\" ports which, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA), smugglers have been using more often. Other east coast ports identified by the NCA as being used to illicitly bring in migrants include Tilbury, also in Essex, and Hull. A further 62 smaller east coast ports and landing places were \"normally unmanned\", a report from the UK's border inspectorate said in 2016. It said that Border Force officers had not attended 27 of the 62 during the 15 months to 30 June 2016. The UK has agreements which allow its own border agents to carry out checks at certain ports in France or Belgium. This means they can inspect vehicles before they cross. But not all ports are covered, with the focus on major entry points, like Calais in France, or Brussels Midi Eurostar station in Belgium. A lack of staffing and resources, including vehicle scanners, at east of England ports was highlighted by the border inspectorate's report. Technology, like scanners and heartbeat and carbon dioxide detectors, have led to the discovery of people concealed in lorries and containers in the past. In 2013, the last official figures available, 268 \"clandestine entrants\" were detected by UK agents using scanners. How do people arrive illicitly in the UK? Since the closures of migrant camps in France, in 2016-17, there have been fewer \"opportunistic\" attempts to enter the UK by individuals. But more Channel crossings are being co-ordinated by organised criminal gangs, according to the UK's National Crime Agency. And during 2018, there was an increase in \"higher risk methods of clandestine entry\". This includes transporting people in containers and refrigerated vehicles - such as the container found in Essex. How many people arrive illegally? The number of people arriving in the UK illicitly is, by its nature, hard to measure. Police forces do compile figures on people arrested for illegally entering the country, but these are not routinely published. However, an investigation by BBC News found there were 27,860 arrests for illegally entering the UK between 2013 and April 2016. In the same period, there were 2,482 arrests for helping people enter the UK. The total number of people living in the UK illegally has been estimated at anything from about 300,000 to 900,000 - but these estimates are very uncertain. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says that there are currently no up-to-date estimates. \"Due to the challenges in making reliable estimates the government has not produced any official estimates since the mid-2000s,\" it said in June. How many migrants have died in transit in the UK? Before this tragedy, five people had been found dead in or on lorries or containers in the UK, since figures started being collected, in 2014. It is thought they died while being smuggled to their intended destination or after stowing away. Data was not collected in the same way before 2014, but these kind of tragedies are not new. In 2000, 58 Chinese migrants were found suffocated in a lorry at Dover. The driver was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 14 years in jail. How many deaths have there been elsewhere in Europe? The UN's International Organisation for Migration started recording deaths such as these in 2014, following a surge in migration to Europe from the Middle East. In 2015, 71 people suffocated in the back of a lorry in Austria. Other incidents have seen vehicles smuggling migrants involved in serious accidents, such as a 2016 minibus crash that killed nine people from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The UN estimates 491 people have died or gone missing crossing Europe since early 2014. The most common causes of death are car and train accidents. About 10 people have been killed in or around the entrances to the Channel Tunnel. The numbers are collected through a mixture of charity, international organisation and media reports. They do not include deaths in migrant camps or detention centres. Nor do they include the estimated 18,500 people who have died, or gone missing, crossing the Mediterranean. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",

    "text": "By Abid Hussain & Shruti MenonBBC Urdu & BBC Reality Check The man whose identity was stolen was regarded as one of the founding fathers of international human rights law, who died aged 92 in 2006. \"It is the largest network we have exposed,\" said Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU DisinfoLab, which undertook the investigation and published an extensive report on Wednesday. The network was designed primarily to \"discredit Pakistan internationally\" and influence decision-making at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and European Parliament, EU DisinfoLab said. EU DisinfoLab partially exposed the network last year but now says the operation is much larger and more resilient than it first suspected. There is no evidence the network is linked to India's government, but it relies heavily on amplifying content produced on fake media outlets with the help of Asian News International (ANI) - India's largest wire service and a key focus of the investigation. The EU DisinfoLab researchers, who are based in Brussels, believe the network's purpose is to disseminate propaganda against India's neighbour and rival Pakistan. Both countries have long sought to control the narrative against the other. Last year, the researchers uncovered 265 pro-Indian sites operating across 65 countries, and traced them back to a Delhi-based Indian holding company, the Srivastava Group (SG). Wednesday's report, titled Indian Chronicles, reveals that the operation, run by SG, is spread over at least 116 countries and has targeted members of the European Parliament and the United Nations - raising questions about how much EU and UN staff knew about SG's activities, and whether they could have done more to counter those activities, especially after last year's report. Mr Alaphilippe said the EU DisinfoLab researchers had never encountered such co-ordination between different stakeholders to spread disinformation. \"During the last 15 years, and even after being exposed last year, the fact that this network managed to operate so effectively shows the sophistication and the drive of the actors behind Indian Chronicles,\" he said. \"You need more than a few computers to plan and sustain such an action,\" he said. The researchers cautioned against \"definitively attributing Indian Chronicles to some specific actors such as Indian intelligence services\" without further investigation. Ben Nimmo, a disinformation network expert, told the BBC the uncovered network was \"one of the most persistent and complex operations\" he had seen, but he too was wary of attributing it to a specific actor. Mr Nimmo, who is director of investigations at digital monitoring firm Graphika, cited previous examples of privately-run large-scale troll operations. \"Just because they're big, it doesn't necessarily mean they're directly run by the state,\" he said. The BBC approached the Indian government for comment but had received no response by the time of publication. Of ghosts and defunct NGOs One of the most important findings of the open-source investigation was establishing direct links between the Srivastava Group (SG) and at least 10 UN-accredited NGOs, along with several others, which were used to promote Indian interests and criticise Pakistan internationally. \"In Geneva, these think tanks and NGOs are in charge of lobbying, of organising demonstrations, speaking during press conferences and UN side-events, and they were often given the floor at the UN on behalf of the accredited organisations,\" the report says. The investigation shows that the operation led by SG began in late 2005, a few months after the UNHRC was founded in its current form. One particular NGO which caught the eye of the researchers was the Commission to Study the Organisation of Peace (CSOP). The CSOP was founded in the 1930s and won UN-accreditation in 1975 but became inactive later in the 1970s. The investigation found that a former chairman of the CSOP - Prof Louis B Sohn, one of the 20th Century's leading international law scholars and a Harvard Law faculty member for 39 years - was listed under the name Louis Shon as a CSOP participant at the UNHRC session in 2007 and at a separate event in Washington DC in 2011. The listings shocked the researchers because Prof Sohn died in 2006. The authors dedicated their investigation to the professor's memory, writing that his name had been \"usurped by the malicious actors in this report\". They said CSOP \"had been resurrected, and its identity hijacked in 2005 by the same actors depicted in our first investigation\". The investigation also shows there were several hundred pro-Indian interventions by the non-accredited NGOs, which were repeatedly given the floor at the UNHRC on behalf of the accredited organisations, pursuing the same agenda of maligning Pakistan. On other occasions, NGOs and organisations which seemingly had nothing to do with Pakistan or India according to their stated objectives would get the opportunity to speak at the UNHRC and target Pakistan. In March 2019, during the UNHRC's 40th session, United Schools International (USI), another UN-accredited organisation with direct links to SG, allowed its slot to be used by Yoana Barakova, a research analyst with an Amsterdam-based think-tank called the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS). Ms Barakova spoke about \"atrocities committed by Pakistan\" during the session. She told the BBC that EFSAS was a partner with USI and she was \"not responsible for organisational logistics\". The BBC received no reply when it contacted the director of EFSAS, who also represented USI at the same session to criticise Pakistan. The primary news agency re-packaging and boosting pro-India content related to SG appears to be ANI, established in 1971, which describes itself as \"South Asia's leading multimedia news agency, with more than 100 bureaus in India, South Asia and across the globe\". Indian news media, especially broadcast media, thrive on content provided by ANI. EU DisinfoLab found at least 13 instances of ANI re-publishing mostly anti-Pakistan and sometimes anti-China op-eds by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), originally published on EU Chronicle, one of the fake news sites linked to SG. EU Chronicle was born in May this year when EP Today, a site flagged in the previous disinformation report, was simply discontinued and renamed. The EU DisinfoLab report said: \"The actors behind the operation hijacked the names of others, tried to impersonate regular media such as the EU Observer... used the letterhead of the European Parliament, registered websites under avatars with fake phone numbers, provided fake addresses to the United Nations, created publishing companies to print books of the think-tanks they owned. \"They used layers of fake media that would quote and republish one another. They used politicians who genuinely wanted to defend women or minority rights to ultimately serve geopolitical interests and gave a platform to far-right politicians when convergent objectives could be reached.\" Mr Alaphilippe said the news agency ANI was being used to give legitimacy to the entire \"influence operation\", which relied \"more on ANI than on any other distribution channel\" to give it \"both credibility and a wide reach to its content\". ANI's news reports have found space in many mainstream Indian news outlets and publishers. Its content was further reproduced on more than 500 fake media websites across 95 countries, the researchers found. Demonstrations in Europe conducted by organisations linked to the Srivastava Group have also been covered by ANI, as well as by fake media websites linked to SG. Focus on the EU and UN According to the findings of the investigation, the disinformation network had a two-pronged strategy to spread influence. In Geneva, the think-tanks and NGOs were in charge of lobbying and protesting, and taking the floor at the UNHRC on behalf of accredited organisations. In Brussels, the focus was on the MEPs, who were taken on international trips and solicited to write \"exclusive\" op-eds for fake outlets like EU Chronicle, which would then be amplified using ANI, the researchers found. A group of MEPs appear regularly in the investigation. One of them, French MEP Thierry Mariani, has written two op-eds for EU Chronicle and was also part of a controversial visit to Indian-administered Kashmir last year. \"If the Indian government is behind the newspaper [EU Chronicle], it is not my problem,\" Mr Mariani, a member of France's far-right National Rally, told the BBC. \"I sign what I want and I feel, it is my opinion. I have connections in [India's governing] Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and I support the government of [Narendra] Modi,\" he said. Two other MEPs named in the report - Angel Dzhambazki from Bulgaria and Grzegorz Tobiszowski from Poland - denied having written op-eds that were published on EU Chronicle. The articles under their names were also reproduced on ANI. Asked what the EU is doing to fight disinformation networks, EU spokesperson on foreign affairs Peter Stano pointed to the action taken to expose EP Today last year. \"Exposing the disinformation and those who spread it is one of our main instruments,\" he told the BBC. \"We will continue to identify them and call them out.\" But he said questions about finances and transparency of NGOs registered in Brussels were for Belgian authorities to answer. Rolando Gomez, a spokesperson for the UNHRC, told the BBC that it was the prerogative of NGOs to raise whichever issue they wish to address and whoever they grant space to speak on the floor. \"There are no rules stating that an NGO must speak to specific issues. Doing so would amount to infringing on their freedom of speech,\" Mr Gomez said. Gary Machado, managing director of EU DisinfoLab, said he thought the muted reaction to the revelation of the disinformation network was partly because it was \"clearly managed by Indian stakeholders\". \"Imagine if the same operation was run by China or Russia. How do you think the world would have reacted? Probably with international outrage, leading to public inquiries and probably sanctions,\" he told the BBC. But the activities of MEPs named in the report prompted criticism from some of their colleagues. MEP Daniel Freund from the Greens said fellow members needed to declare their activities. \"There have been at least 24 breaches of rules in the past years. Not a single violation has been sanctioned. So there is little incentive to respect the rules when the worst that can happen is to file a declaration after you have been caught,\" he said. Another member, who did not want to be named, said MEPs contributing to sites like EU Chronicles had been identified as \"election tourists\". \"A ragtag group of MEPs from the bottom of the parliamentary barrel who prefer to travel on sponsored trips by unsavoury governments rather than invest in their mandate,\" the MEP told the BBC. \"How PR stunts with such individuals could be even conceived as helpful is baffling.\" The BBC put questions to ANI and to nine other MEPs who have written op-eds for the EU Chronicle and made visits to India, Bangladesh and the Maldives, but received no response. Who are the Srivastavas - and what next? The investigations from last year and this year show a man called Ankit Srivastava at the centre of the entire global operation that was uncovered. More than 400 domain names have been bought through Mr Srivastava's private email address or through email addresses belonging to his organisations, the EU DisinfoLab investigations found. Then, there's a case of the mysterious SG-owned tech firm Aglaya. Its website has been inaccessible since at least February this year but in the past the company has advertised products for \"hacking/spy tools\" and \"information warfare services\". Aglaya's marketing brochure mentioned the ability to \"hamper country level reputations\" and described some of its services as \"Cyber Nukes\". In a 2017 interview with Forbes magazine, a man called Ankur Srivastava claimed he \"only sold to Indian intelligence agencies\". It's unclear what relation, if any, he has to Ankit Srivastava. A third Srivastava appears to be Dr Pramila Srivastava, chairperson of the group and mother of Ankit Srivastava. Dr Harshindar Kaur, a paediatrician from the Indian state of Punjab, told the EU DisinfoLab researchers that in 2009 she had been invited to the UNHRC in Geneva to give a lecture on female foeticide when she was threatened by a woman called Dr P Srivastava, who claimed to be a \"very senior government official from India\". Dr Kaur told the BBC it was Pramila Srivastava who had threatened her. The BBC emailed Ankit Srivastava asking him to respond to this and the other allegations in the report, but received no reply. When the BBC visited the firm's offices in Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave, staff there would not answer questions. What might happen to the network, or how it might evolve, in the light of the latest investigation is unclear. The authors of Indian Chronicles say their findings \"should serve as a call to action for decision-makers to put in place a relevant framework to sanction actors abusing international institutions\". Mr Alaphilippe said following the 2019 investigation there had been \"no official communication, no sanction, nothing. This passivity gave a message to Indian Chronicles: you've been exposed, but no consequences\". \"We think there should be consequences to disinformation and we expect actions to be taken. The biggest failure from institutions would be if another report is released next year on the same actors with the same techniques,\" he told the BBC. \"This would mean that EU institutions are ok with foreign interference.\" You might also be interested in:",

    "text": "By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Ronan Hughes faces 39 manslaughter charges and one charge of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. The 40-year-old father-of-two is from Leitrim in Tyholland, County Monaghan. Dublin's High Court heard him described as the ringleader and organiser of the criminal enterprise for financial gain. The bodies of the 39 Vietnamese citizens were found in a refrigerated lorry trailer in Grays last October after it had landed at Purfleet in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. The manslaughter charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison and the conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration carries a maximum penalty of 14 years behind bars. At the recent High Court extradition hearing in Dublin, at which the judge ordered his extradition, Mr Hughes indicated that he would not appeal and wanted to be surrendered to the UK authorities as soon as the legal formalities allowed. Earlier this year, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson from Craigavon, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey in London to 39 counts of manslaughter. Another Northern Ireland man wanted in connection with the Essex discovery could be extradited from Dublin in the near future. Eamonn Harrison, 22, from Mayobridge in County Down, is alleged to have driven the container in which the 39 bodies were found to Zeebrugge before it sailed on to Essex.

    "text": "By Helen BriggsBBC News The area is now dominated by salt pans, but was once home to an enormous lake, which may have been our ancestral heartland 200,000 years ago. Our ancestors settled for 70,000 years, until the local climate changed, researchers have proposed. They began to move on as fertile green corridors opened up, paving the way for future migrations out of Africa. \"It has been clear for some time that anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago,\" said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. \"What has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors.\" Prof Hayes' conclusions have drawn scepticism from other researchers in the field, however. Lakeland haven The area in question is south of the Zambezi basin, in northern Botswana. The researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's huge lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now an area of sprawling salt flats. \"It's an extremely large area, it would have been very wet, it would have been very lush,\" said Prof Hayes. \"And it would have actually provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived.\" After staying there for 70,000 years, people began to move on. Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up. The first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today. This scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans. By combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago. Reconstructing the human story However, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone. Other analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process. \"You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins,\" he told BBC News. \"I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins.\" Thus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down.

    "text": "Schools across the state are closed and public transport too has been suspended. One person was killed in clashes on Wednesday. The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of \"menstruating age\" - defined as between 10 and 50. The Supreme Court revoked the ban in September, which prompted outrage. On Wednesday, Bindu Ammini, 40, and Kanakadurga, 39, entered the shrine around dawn and became the first women to do so. Thursday saw a second day of protests across the state. Right-wing groups, supported by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demanded a state-wide shutdown. They wanted schools, colleges and businesses to remain closed as a sign of protest. The state government, which supports the Supreme Court ruling, stepped up security and deployed police across the state for protection. But fearing violence, schools and shops were closed. And buses did not run as protesters blocked highways and other roads. In total, more than 700 people were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday. Sixty police officers were injured, more than 80 public buses were damaged and at least a dozen police vehicles were attacked. How big are these protests? Violence broke out in several cities and towns on Wednesday as groups of protesters clashed with police, who fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Police told news agency AFP that at least 15 people were injured after protesters hurled stones at them. According to local media reports, around 100 people were arrested by police in one district, where a mob assaulted a woman police officer. Police told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that they have also detained two people in connection with the death of a man during the protests on Wednesday. Several journalists were also attacked in the protests that engulfed the state capital, Thiruvathapuram. Police said they are investigating the matter. Indian airlines have issued warnings to passengers travelling to Kerala. Why has the issue become so political? The Kerala state government supports the court verdict and Mr Vijayan has repeatedly said his government will provide the security to enforce it. But India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that the court ruling is an attack on Hindu values. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. Even the protests have turned into an ideological battle between the right and the left - most of the protesters belong to right-wing groups affiliated to the BJP; and those who support the court ruling are affiliated to Kerala's left-wing coalition government. Why are women of a certain age not allowed to enter Sabarimala? The Supreme Court decision to let women worship at the Sabarimala shrine came after a petition argued that the custom banning them violated gender equality. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, rather than banning women in a broad age group from entering at all. Protesters have consistently argued that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayyappa. They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity, who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy and hence, women of a certain age are not allowed into the temple.",

    "text": "He said failure to act could embolden Iran and lead to war, which he said would ruin the global economy. The prince was speaking after an attack on oil facilities which he blames on Tehran. Iran said the remarks would \"bring [the Saudis] nothing but shame\". Mohammed bin Salman also said he accepted some responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. But, speaking to CBS News, he denied personally ordering it. The prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, is suspected of personally targeting Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of the government in Riyadh. Mr Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes news programme on Sunday, he said: \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it [the killing] was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\" However, he denied ordering the killing of Mr Khashoggi directly, or having knowledge of it at the time. Saudi authorities have since blamed a \"rogue\" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial. You may also be interested in: The prince also appeared to offer talks for a political solution to the civil war in Yemen, where government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition are fighting Houthi rebels supported by Iran. Iran is Saudi Arabia's regional rival and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power. US-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year, with the US blaming Iran on attacks on six oil tankers in the Gulf between May and July. Tehran rejects the accusations. Remarks betray Saudi vulnerability There are subtle clues in this interview as to why the Saudi response to the 14 September drone and missile attacks has been so restrained. Note that the crown prince warns that a war with Iran would be catastrophic, not just for his country but for the global economy. Four years ago, when MBS committed his forces to the disastrous war in Yemen, his response might have been bolder. But the Yemen war has not gone as the Saudis intended while their enemy, the Houthi rebels, are launching ever increasing numbers of drones and missiles across the common border. The recent attacks on the Saudi oil industry, widely blamed on Iran, did real damage. So the Saudis now know just how vulnerable their critical infrastructure is to any Iranian strike. On the Khashoggi murder, the crown prince's \"taking of responsibility\" is a belated acknowledgment of how much unease there still is about this incident in the West. But that, of course, is not the same as admitting any involvement in it, which he and his government still deny. What about the crown prince's oil warning? Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities earlier in September, which knocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. But Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, said: \"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests. \"Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes.\" He said the Middle East region \"represents about 30% of the world's energy supplies, about 20% of global trade passages, about 4% of the world GDP\". \"Imagine all of these three things stop. This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,\" the prince said. He blamed Iranian \"stupidity\" for the attacks, saying there was no strategic goal. Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and seven cruise missiles were fired on the country's two oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have said they were behind the attacks. A week after the facilities were hit, the US pledged to send troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend against further attacks. What did he say about Yemen? The prince urged Iran to cease its support for Houthi rebels, saying it would be \"much easier\" to bring the war to an end. \"Today we open all initiatives for a political solution in Yemen,\" he said. \"We hope this happens today rather than tomorrow.\" He welcomed a Houthi ceasefire, announced several days ago, as a \"positive step\" towards political dialogue. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population requiring humanitarian assistance or protection. More than 70,000 people are believed to have died since 2016 as a result of the conflict, according to UN estimates. What about jailed women's rights activists? The crown prince said he would \"personally follow up\" on allegations that women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was tortured in jail. Ms Hathloul and other activists have been in custody for more than a year, despite organising a successful campaign for rights such as that of a woman to drive and travel without a man's permission. But the prince said the decision whether or not to release the activists lay not with him, but with the public prosecutor. Asked why they had been jailed, he said laws had to be respected, even though there were some he disagreed with.",

    "text": "The reports brought down film mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct and rape. He says all sexual encounters were consensual. The investigations sparked the #MeToo movement, a broad pushback against sexual harassment in many industries. Pulitzers are the most prestigious honour in American journalism. The Pulitzer Prize Board also awards prizes in other literary and artistic categories. This year, rapper Kendrick Lamar becomes the first non-classical or jazz artist to be given the prize for music. The Washington Post won the investigative reporting prize for revealing decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama. The Republican former judge denied the accusations, but they factored heavily in the special election that the Democratic candidate Doug Jones went on to win. The New York Times also shared a second prize with The Washington Post for coverage of Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The biggest prize winners revealed on Monday reflected a recent reckoning in the US - and beyond - over the treatment of women by powerful men in the highest ranks of showbusiness, politics, technology and media. Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy said the New York Times' team, led by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and The New Yorker's contributor Ronan Farrow produced \"explosive, impactful journalism that exposed wealthy and powerful sexual predators.\" Their separate, original reporting in October of allegations of assault and harassment by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was followed by more than 100 women coming forward to share their experiences at the hands of the film producer. Mr Weinstein - who was ousted from the company he founded - went on to apologise for his behaviour but denied any non-consensual sexual contact. The 66-year-old has been hit by a number of civil lawsuits and is being investigated by police in London, Los Angeles and New York. The exposé led to the watershed #MeToo movement, with thousands of women across the world empowered to speak out about sexual harassment they have faced in their lives. Other Pulitzer winners included Reuters, which won the 2018 prize in international reporting for coverage of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. The news agency also won in the feature photography category for its coverage of the Rohingya crisis, which saw an exodus of 700,000 refugees from Myanmar into Bangladesh. The Pulitzers have been awarded since 1917. More than 2,400 entries were submitted for prizes in categories ranging from public service and breaking news to commentary, cartooning and photography.",

    "text": "By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi Periods have long been a taboo in the country, menstruating women are believed to be impure and are still excluded from social and religious events. In recent years, these archaic ideas have been increasingly challenged, especially by urban educated women. But two recent reports show that India's very problematic relationship with menstruation continues. A vast majority of women, especially those from poor families, with no agency and no education, are forced to make choices that have long-term and irreversible impacts on their health and their lives. The first comes from the western state of Maharashtra where it has been revealed by Indian media that thousands of young women have undergone surgical procedures to remove their wombs in the past three years. In a substantial number of cases they have done this so they can get work as sugarcane harvesters. Every year, tens of thousands of poor families from Beed, Osmanabad, Sangli and Solapur districts migrate to more affluent western districts of the state - known as \"the sugar belt\" - to work for six months as \"cutters\" in sugarcane fields. Once there, they are at the mercy of greedy contractors who use every opportunity to exploit them. To begin with, they are reluctant to hire women because cane-cutting is hard work and women may miss a day or two of work during their periods. If they do miss a day's work, they have to pay a penalty. You may also be interested in: The living conditions at their work-place are far from ideal - the families have to live in huts or tents close to the fields, there are no toilets, and as harvesting is sometimes done even at night, there is no fixed time for sleeping or waking. And when women get their periods, it just becomes that much more tough for them. Because of the poor hygienic conditions, many women catch infections and, activists working in the region say, unscrupulous doctors encourage them to undergo unnecessary surgery even if they visit for a minor gynaecological problem which can be treated with medicine. As most women in these areas are married young, many have two to three children by the time they are in their mid-20s, and because doctors don't tell them about the problems they would face if they underwent a hysterectomy, many believe that it's OK to get rid of their wombs. This has turned several villages in the region into \"villages of womb-less women\". After the issue was raised last month in the state assembly by legislator Neelam Gorhe, Maharashtra Health Minister Eknath Shinde admitted that there had been 4,605 hysterectomies just in Beed district in three years. But, he said, not all of them were carried out on women who worked as sugarcane harvesters. The minister said a committee had been set up to investigate several of the cases. My colleague Prajakta Dhulap from the BBC's Marathi language service, who visited Vanjarwadi village in Beed district, says from October to March every year, 80% of villagers migrate to work in sugarcane fields. She reports that half of the women in the village have had hysterectomies - most are under the age of 40 and some are still in their 20s. Many of the women she met said their health had deteriorated since they underwent surgery. One woman talked about the \"persistent pain in her back, neck and knee\" and how she wakes up in the morning with \"swollen hands, face and feet\". Another complained of \"constant dizziness\" and how she was unable to walk even short distances. As a result, they both said they were no longer able to work in the fields. The second piece of news, from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, is equally dire. Women working in the multi-billion dollar garment industry there allege that they have been given unlabelled drugs at work - instead of a day off - when they have complained of period pain. According to a Thomson Reuters Foundation expose, based on interviews with about 100 women, the drugs were rarely provided by medical professionals and the seamstresses, mostly from poor disadvantaged families, said they couldn't afford to lose a day's wages on account of period pains. All of the 100 women who were interviewed said they had received drugs, and more than half said that as a result, their health had suffered. Most said they were not told the name of the drugs or warned about any possible side-effects. Many of the women blamed these medicines for their health problems, ranging from depression and anxiety, to urinary tract infections, fibroids and miscarriages. The reports have forced the authorities into action. The National Commission for Women has described the condition of the women in Maharashtra as \"pathetic and miserable\" and asked the state government to prevent such \"atrocities\" in future. In Tamil Nadu, the government said they would monitor the health of the garment workers. The reports come at a time when attempts are being made across the world to increase women's participation in the workforce by implementing gender-sensitive policies. Worryingly, female workforce participation in India has fallen from 36% in 2005-06 to 25.8% in 2015-16 and it's not hard to understand why if we look at the conditions in which women have to work. In Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and a few other countries, women are allowed a day off work during their periods. Many private companies also offer similar relief. \"In India too, the Bihar state government has been allowing women employees to take two extra days off every month since as far back as 1992 and it seems to be working very well,\" says Urvashi Prasad, a public policy specialist at the Indian government think tank, Niti Aayog. And last year, a female MP tabled a Menstrual Benefits Bill in the parliament, seeking two days off every month for every working woman in the country. Ms Prasad says there are challenges to implementing any policy in a vast country like India, especially in the informal sector where it needs much more monitoring. But, she says, if a start is made in the formal sector, it can signal a change in mindsets and help remove the stigma that surrounds menstruation in India. \"So what we need is for the powerful organised private sector and the government to take a stand, we need people at the top to send the right signals,\" she says. \"We have to start somewhere and eventually we can expect to see some change in the unorganised sector too.\" The Menstrual Benefits Bill is a private member's bill so it's unlikely that it will come to much, but if it does become law, it would likely benefit the women who work in Tamil Nadu's garment factories which will have to implement it. But such welfare measures rarely benefit those employed in India's vast unorganised sector, which means that women like those working in Maharashtra's sugarcane fields will remain at the mercy of their contractors.

    "text": "Among the 23 charges levelled against them are money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. The latter is an intriguing tale of the alleged theft of a T-Mobile robot known as Tappy. The charges came as China and the US headed into scheduled high-level trade talks. Tensions are already high over the arrest of Ms Meng in Canada last month. She faces extradition to the US for allegedly evading sanctions on Iran. The indictments, by the US Department of Justice, have only been partially unsealed, but here's what we know so far: The Iranian connection Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng are charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. It is alleged that, from 2009-14, the two deliberately dodged sanctions against Iran by dealing through a company called Skycom. Ms Meng and other Huawei executives - including an unnamed \"founder\" - allegedly called Skycom a \"local partner.\" Prosecutors, however, say Skycom was owned by Huawei through a subsidiary company. Ms Meng is also accused of lying to banks about her relationship with Skycom. If found guilty of the charges against her, she faces up to 30 years in prison. Huawei would also be forced to pay financial penalties. 'Stealing secrets' from T-Mobile In the second indictment, Huawei has been landed with 10 criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Prosecutors say it deliberately tried to steal robot technology from network provider T-Mobile. The robot, known as Tappy, mimicked human fingers to test phone durability and was kept in a secure lab in Washington state. The technology behind it was a closely-guarded secret but T-Mobile allowed some phone manufacturers to use Tappy within the lab. In 2012, engineers at Huawei's US branch were given access to Tappy after the two companies entered into a supply agreement. For this access, Huawei had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Prosecutors allege that it violated this agreement. Citing emails and phone calls, it is claimed that Huawei engineers in the US were directed by executives in China to take photos and share notes of Tappy's specifications. In one instance, a Huawei engineer (referred to as AX) allegedly took the robot arm from T-Mobile's lab without permission. AX first denied stealing the arm but \"later claimed he found it in his bag\". According to the indictment, AX returned the arm but first emailed pictures and technical information to colleagues in China. After the incident, Huawei told T-Mobile that it had launched an internal investigation and found that the people involved had \"acted on their own\". Despite Huawei's attempts to distance itself, prosecutors say that - at the time of the report - Huawei's China branch launched a \"bonus programme to reward employees who stole confidential info from competitors\". If found guilty of the charges Huawei will be fined up to $5m (£3.8m), or three times the value of the stolen trade secret - whichever is greater. T-Mobile has already taken Huawei to court over the incident. It tried to claim $500m in damages and settled in 2017 for $4.8m. A jury ruled that Huawei misappropriated trade secrets but had not done so wilfully or with malice. Unlike the new indictment, it was tried as a civil case - not a criminal one. T-Mobile told the BBC it had no comment to make over the new indictment. What happens now? Several details of the investigation have been kept private, and it is not yet known what else is in the indictments. Under US law a judge will be assigned for each case. The judges will then set deadlines for the next legal steps. There is no set timeframe for a resolution and it can often take years for a dispute to make it to court. The matter may even be settled out of court. Following the indictment, the US sent Canada a formal request to extradite Ms Meng for violating US sanctions. Canada's Department of Justice now has 29 days to decide if an extradition hearing should take place. Ms Meng has denied the accusations against her. In a statement to the BBC, Huawei also denied any wrongdoing and said it was \"disappointed\" by the charges. The firm added that - after Ms Meng's arrest - it had tried meeting with the US Department of Justice to talk about the investigation. It claims this request \"was rejected without explanation\". China's foreign ministry has also weighed in on the indictments. It's accused the US of using \"state power to discredit and crack down on specific Chinese companies in an attempt to strangle the enterprises' legitimate and legal operations\".",

    "text": "The Swedish Academy has been in crisis over its handling of allegations against the husband of a member. She has since quit, as have the academy's head and four other members. The academy says it will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. The scandal is the biggest to hit the prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Apart from six years during the world wars, there has been only one year when the prize was not awarded. No worthy winner was found in 1935. This year's other Nobel prizes will go ahead as usual. What did the academy say? In a statement on its website, the academy said: \"The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy.\" It said that the academy's \"operative practices need to be evolved\", including tackling its statutes, conflict-of-interest issues and management of information. Some academy members had argued that the prize should proceed to protect the tradition, but others said the institution was in no state to present the award. The #MeToo campaign, which showed the prevalence of sexual assault globally, may have played a part in the academy's decision. It would have been difficult for potential winners to accept the prize with the academy in such turmoil. Academy faces struggle to regain reputation Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm This is an unusual but not entirely unexpected decision here in Sweden where internal spats between members and former members of the Swedish Academy have been headline news for months. The institution has faced deep criticism from the academic community with hundreds of professors, lecturers and researchers signing a number of letters calling for the academy to take action to restore its credibility. But this is a scandal that's also captured wider attention. Many Swedes are fiercely proud of the Nobel prizes and the fact that they live in a country that usually champions women's rights. Seeing the prestigious literature award committee unravel off the back of the mishandling of sexual assault allegations has been a bitter pill to swallow. Not everyone is confident the academy will regain its reputation in time for next year's prize announcements. What sparked the crisis? Divisions started to emerge last November when French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural project with funding from the Swedish Academy, was accused by 18 women of sexual assault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. Mr Arnault denies the allegations. The organisation later voted against removing Mr Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its committee. This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, divided the organisation. What followed was a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius. Only 11 members are now in place. Of those, one, Kerstin Ekman, has been inactive since 1989, when the academy refused to condemn the fatwa issued over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. The academy's statutes require a quorum of 12 to vote in any new members. Technically, members are appointed for life to the Swedish Academy and cannot resign, although they can refuse to take part. Academy patron King Carl XVI Gustaf has said he will change the rules to allow them to quit formally. So what happens next? The academy said: \"Work on the selection of a laureate is at an advanced stage and will continue as usual in the months ahead but the Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work, before the next Literature Prize winner is declared.\" Two prizes for literature will be announced next year, one for 2018 and one for 2019. This is not the first time this has happened. On five occasions a prize for one year has been awarded at the same time as the following year's prize. For example, American playwright Eugene O'Neill was given the 1936 award in 1937. What's the social reaction been?

    "text": "The 27-year-old German, identified as Jennifer W, and her husband bought the child as a house \"slave\" in the IS-occupied Iraqi city of Mosul 2015. Her husband chained the girl up outside after she fell ill and Jennifer W did nothing to save her, prosecutors say. She also faces murder and weapons offences charges. If found guilty in the terrorism court in the city of Munich she faces a maximum sentence of life in jail. The five-year-old girl was among a group of prisoners-of-war when Jennifer W and her husband bought her. German media say the child may have been a member of the Yazidi minority, many of whom were captured and enslaved by IS as the militant group swept across northern Iraq in 2014. \"After the girl fell ill and wet her mattress, the husband of the accused chained her up outside as punishment and let the child die in agony of thirst in the scorching heat,\" prosecutors said in a statement. \"The accused allowed her husband to do so and did nothing to save the girl.\" Jennifer W travelled to Iraq in 2014, where she became a member of IS's self-styled morality police, the allegations against her say. Her role saw her patrol parks in Mosul and another IS-occupied city, Fallujah, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a pistol and an explosives vest, prosecutors said. \"Her task was to ensure that women comply with the behavioural and clothing regulations established by the terrorist organisation,\" said the statement. Jennifer W was arrested by Turkish police months after the girl's death after she visited the German embassy in the capital Ankara to renew her identity papers. She was extradited to Germany, where she was initially allowed to return to her home in the state of Lower Saxony because of a lack of evidence against her. German police arrested her in June as she tried to travel to Syria and she has been in custody since then. No date has yet been set for the trial. Mosul was liberated from IS last year after a three-year occupation and the group has now lost almost all the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria.",

    "text": "He was charged with molesting seven girls, many of whom are gymnasts, while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. As part of the plea deal, Nassar, 54, could face at least 25 years in prison. The hearing comes after a third former US Olympian, Gabby Douglas, accused him of sexual abuse. Douglas reveals abuse by team doctor In a statement to the court on Wednesday, Nassar said he was pleading guilty to \"move the community forward and stop the hurting\". \"I'm so sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire, out of control,\" he said. \"I want them to heal. I want this community to heal. I have no animosity toward any one. I just want healing. It's time.\" \"You used that position of trust that you had in the most vile way - to abuse children,\" Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said, noting that sex abuse is a nationwide \"epidemic\". \"You violated the oath that you took, which is to do no harm, and you harmed them. Selfishly.\" Many of his accusers testified that they were abused while he was examining the young athletes, and sometimes while their parents were nearby. He has been accused of abusing more than 130 women - including Olympic gold medalists Ms Douglas, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney - during his time as team doctor for the US women's gymnastics team. Ms Douglas, who was one of the so-called Fierce Five that won gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, revealed her accusation on Instagram. \"I didn't publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful,\" she wrote. During the hearing Ms Raisman, a member of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, tweeted that she was \"disgusted\" that Nassar, who lost his licence, was referred to as a doctor. Nassar's case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year. Mr Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations. In a statement after the plea deal was announced, USA Gymnastics - the organisation which determines the US Olympic team - said it is \"very sorry that any athlete was harmed\" by their former doctor. They added that it was \"important\" that he acknowledged \"his appalling and devious conduct\" in court and said the deal \"permits punishment without further victimisation of survivors\". Nassar has already pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child pornography in federal court and could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before accepting the plea, Judge Aquilina asked him to confirm that he did not wear gloves when abusing his victims between 1998 and 2015, when he was fired. The alleged examinations were \"not for any medical purposes is that right? It was for your own purpose, is that right?\", the judge asked. Nassar responded: \"Yes.\" He is due to be sentenced on 12 January.",

That left his firm owing Ericsson 5.5bn rupees ($80m; £60m), which it failed to pay by a court deadline. The move marks a new twist a long-running feud between the brothers. RCom failed to comply with an India Supreme Court order to pay Ericsson the money by 15 December last year. The court found him guilty of contempt, giving him another four weeks to pay or go to prison. On Monday, RCom said the debt had been paid. \"My sincere and heartfelt thanks to my respected elder brother, Mukesh, and (his wife) Nita, for standing by me during these trying times, and demonstrating the importance of staying true to our strong family values by extending this timely support,\" Anil Ambani said. The two brothers have long had an acrimonious relationship, fighting over their father's businesses after he died in 2002 without a will. The Reliance empire was divided between the two brothers in 2005 after a bitter seven-month feud. The brothers have fought bruising court battles in the past over natural gas interests. Mukesh Ambani is worth more than $54bn, according to Bloomberg. His firm Reliance Industries, whose activities span from oil to telecommunications, is among India's most valuable companies. By contrast, Anil Ambani has an estimated net worth of around $300m, Bloomberg said.

    "text": "On Sunday, Delhi approved the vaccine - known as Covaxin - as well as the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being manufactured in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi touted the approval as a \"game changer\". The head of Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, defended the approval process, but health experts warn it was rushed. Health watchdog All India Drug Action Network said it was \"shocked\". It said that there were \"intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data\" as well a lack of transparency that would \"raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies\". The statement came after India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was \"safe and provides a robust immune response\". He added the vaccines had been approved for restricted use in \"public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains\". \"The vaccines are 100% safe,\" he said, adding that side effects such as \"mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine\". The All India Drug Action Network, however, said it was \"baffled to understand the scientific logic\" to approve \"an incompletely studied vaccine\". One of India's most eminent medical experts, Dr Gagandeep Kang, told the Times of India newspaper that she had \"not seen anything like this before\". She added that \"there is absolutely no efficacy data that has been presented or published\". Even social media users were quick to point out that approving the vaccine before trials were complete was a matter of concern irrespective of how safe or effective the vaccine eventually turned out to be. But Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, met reporters on Monday and said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed. He cited previous examples where emergency authorisation approvals had been given based only on immunogenicity data. \"Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,\" he said. \"We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February.\" The company currently has 20 million doses available and plans to produce about 700 million doses this year, Dr Ella said. \"We have four facilities coming up and we are planning [to make] around 200 million doses in Hyderabad, 500 million doses in other cities.\" A matter of trust Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Many scientists and opposition politicians have raised questions over what they say is the hasty authorisation of Covaxin. Bharat Biotech has developed the vaccine with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research - and the effort has been touted as an example of India's might in vaccine development and production. Regulators say the vaccine is safe and effective. The firm says phase 1 and phase 2 trials have shown good results. But scientists say that the government's decision not to release data on the vaccine's efficacy for peer review has raised concerns. Mr Modi has welcomed the approval, saying Covaxin is a shining example of his ambitious Atmnirbhar (self-reliance) India campaign. But experts worry that questions over the approval process don't bode well for the campaign. And there could be deeper issues. Many believe that the government needs to be more transparent about the authorisation process because the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme depends on public trust. The emergency authorisation also sparked a fierce debate on Indian Twitter on Sunday night between ministers and opposition leaders. India's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called out opposition leaders for failing to \"applaud\" the country's \"prowess\" in locally producing a vaccine. India makes about 60% of vaccines globally. Members of the main opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Akhilesh Yadav, were among those who raised concerns about the manner in which Covaxin was approved. The approval comes as India gears up to vaccinate its population of more than 1.3 billon people. Amid fears that richer countries are buying up much of the vaccine supply, India too appears to be stockpiling vaccines. In an interview with the Associated Press, Adar Poonawalla, whose Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, said the jab was given emergency authorisation on the condition that it would not be exported outside India. Mr Poonawalla said his company, the world's largest vaccine maker, was also not allowed to sell the shot in the private market. This has raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which were primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations. Bangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase, Reuters reported, but now the fate of the order is unclear. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected the first batch of the jab by February. India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people on a priority list by August. It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died. Both vaccines approved on Sunday can be transported and stored at normal refrigeration temperatures.",

    "text": "He eventually made it to Germany, but only after surviving months of torture and starvation at the hands of three separate slave traders who bought and sold migrants as if they were cattle. Here, he tells Bekele Atoma from the BBC's Afaan Oromo service his remarkable story. Harun, 27, was born in Agarfa, in the province of Bale, some 240 miles (390km) south-east of the capital Addis Adaba. Bale has some of the highest rates of emigration in Ethiopia and, in 2013, he joined the exodus, pushed by a lack of jobs at home. First, he travelled to Sudan, before deciding to set out on the next part of his journey to Europe. \"After living a year and a few months in Sudan, I started a journey to Libya with other migrants - paying $600 each to smugglers,\" he explained. \"We were 98 on a lorry. People had to sit on top of each other and the heat was unbearable. \"We had encountered a lot of problems on our way. There are these armed people in the desert who stop you all of a sudden and steal everything you have.\" His real troubles began at the border. After six days travelling through the Sahara Desert, the group reached the border of Egypt, Libya and Chad. It was here the smugglers met to exchange migrants, Harun said. But something went wrong. \"At the border place, a group of gangsters kidnapped us all and took us to Chad,\" he said. \"They drove us for two days through the Sahara and led us into their camp.\" Once there, the heavily armed group - who spoke Arabic and a number of other languages - explained what they wanted. \"They brought a car and said those of us who can pay $4,000 each can get into the car and those who can't have to remain there. \"We didn't have that money but we talked to each other and decided to pretend we had and to get into the car anyway.\" Harun and his friends were driven for another three days, before arriving at another place where they sell migrants - including Harun. \"Those who took us over told us that they had bought us for $4,000 each - and that unless we paid that money back we wouldn't be going anywhere,\" he said. Their fate if they did not come up with the money was hauntingly clear. \"There were migrants, mostly of Somali and Eritrean origin, who had been there for more than five months. They had suffered a lot and they didn't look like human beings. \"We suffered a lot too. They forced us to drink hot water mixed with petroleum to make us pay them quickly. They gave us a tiny amount of food, and only once a day. They tortured us every night.\" 'Too bony to buy' Harun was unable to get the money to pay his new captors, and he remained trapped in the camp with another 31 Ethiopians for 80 days. Eventually, the traders became fed up. \"'You are not going to pay us, so we will sell you,' the traders told us,\" Harun recalled. \"We had no food for more than two months and we were very bony. As a result the man who they brought to sell us to refused to buy us, saying: 'They don't even have a kidney'.\" Finally, the traders found a buyer, a man from the Libyan city of Saba, who paid $3,000 each. \"We get into his car convinced we couldn't see anything worse than we'd already seen. But in Saba, after four days of travel, we faced a suffering that was inhuman. \"They tortured us, putting plastic bags on our faces, tying our hands behind our backs, and throwing us upside down into a barrel full of water. They beat us with steel wires.\" Harun and his friends endured this torture for a month before finally managing to reach their relatives and beg them to send the money. \"They let us go but before we had got very far, some other people ambushed us and took us to their warehouse. They told us that unless we pay $1,000 each they wouldn't let us go. \"The torture and beating continued. We called our families back home and asked them to send us money again. They sold their cattle, land and whatever possessions they had and sent us the money.\" Refugee status Finally, Harun made it 480 miles north to the capital Tripoli, a major hub for those wanting to risk the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. \"The situation there was a bit better,\" Harun said. \"We worked for a few months, whatever jobs we could get, and then crossed the Mediterranean to Europe.\" But even that is not safe. \"Unless you are lucky, the police will catch you and take you to prison. And they will sell you to smugglers - sometimes for as little as $500.\" Harun was one of the lucky ones: he reached Italy, before crossing into Germany - where his refugee request was accepted. \"Life is good now,\" he says, but what he endured to reach Europe - and those he lost along the way - will forever remain etched on his memory. \"We buried one of our friends at the border between Egypt and Libya. Two more of them left us in the city of Saba; I don't whether they are alive or not. Another girl fell into the Mediterranean but some others managed to reach Europe.\" But would he make the journey again, knowing what he knows now? \"No,\" he says. \"Frankly speaking, I lacked nothing but knowledge when I left my country. I could have gone to school or worked there. \"I saw people leaving and this, in addition the political situation, persuaded me to flee.\"",

    "text": "It is putting 76% of the business up for sale in what would be India's most high profile asset sale in decades. Air India has relied on taxpayer-funded bailouts to stay operational - and the new buyer would take on about $5bn (£3.6bn) of debt. If privatisation goes ahead, it will be a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's claims to be a reformist leader. But it is not a done deal. Such plans have been abandoned before, and unions have threatened wide-ranging protests if ministers push ahead this time. Once the country's only airline, Air India has lost market share to new entrants and suffered from a reputation for poor service and cancelled flights. It has not turned a profit since 2007 - but with India seeing passenger growth of around 20% per year and analysts saying the Indian market is vastly underserved - it could still be a tempting prospect for would-be buyers. What's up for sale? According to documents released by the government, Air India will be put up for sale as four different entities. Bidders are allowed to make separate offers for the four divisions - or for a combination of them. Who'll buy it? International routes are the most lucrative part of the Air India business, with slots at major international airports including London Heathrow and New York JFK. IndiGo, India's biggest airline, has said that it would like to carve out Air India's international passenger airline operations - to add to the seven international destinations it already flies to. But that is not an option currently on the table - and Indigo said it would also \"evaluate\" the option of taking on all of the airline business and see if it was \"economically feasible for us to go down that path\". \"At the end of the day, this exercise is not about becoming bigger for the sake of being bigger - it is all about profitable growth,\" co-founder Rahul Bhatia said. But he was clear IndiGo was not looking at buying all of Air India's businesses and subsidiaries. \"In our view, that would be a herculean task which would at best be a very challenging proposition and at worst an impossible task, unless an organisation is willing to fund large losses for a very long time,\" Mr Bhatia said. Another potential buyer is Vistara - the joint venture airline run between India's Tata Group and Singapore Airlines. Earlier this month, Singapore Airlines general manager David Lim told the BBC that it was \"open\" to an Air India bid. \"We haven't closed the doors and when that happens we will look at it\", he said Indian rules state that majority ownership of any national airline needs to be with an Indian national. So while international carriers can make a bid - the biggest stake they can hold is 49%. Jet Airways, another Indian carrier, is also likely to take a serious look at an offer - perhaps in partnership with an international carrier. Media reports suggest Air France and Delta may be interested. The government has waived some of the criteria for existing Indian airline operators to make bids - relating to net worth and recent profitability - so long as they bid as part of a consortium. Qatar Airways was another international airline linked with buying a stake in Air India, but it has since denied any interest. Any caveats? The eventual buyer of Air India may eventually have to list the airline on the stock exchange - which would be a clear incentive to make it profitable within a fixed time frame. It is likely that at this point, the government would then sell its remaining 24% in the business. The buyer will be taking on about $5bn of debt. However, this is only about half of what the airline owes. So in effect the buyer is getting a smaller proportion of the debt than it might expect for a 76% stake - which might make things more appealing. What's the time line? Would-be bidders have until 14 May to make initial proposals. Shortlisted bidders will be informed by 28 May.",

    "text": "By Kevin PonniahBBC News, Delhi India was in the grip of patriotic fervour in early March when WhatsApp groups were flooded with photographs claiming to show proof that unprecedented Indian air strikes in Pakistani territory had been successful. While India's government said the 26 February strikes had killed a \"large number of militants\", Islamabad insisted there had been no casualties. But BBC fact-checkers found that the photos - purportedly of dead militants and a destroyed training camp - were old images that were being shared with false captions. One photo showed a crowd of Muslim women and men gathered around three bodies but those pictured were actually victims of a suicide attack in Pakistan in 2014. A series of photos - of crumbling buildings, piles of debris and bodies in shrouds lying on the ground - were traced to a devastating earthquake in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in 2005. WhatsApp and Facebook have been struggling to curb the impact of \"fake news\" - messages, photos and videos peddling misleading or outright false information - in elections around the world. But India's upcoming election - the world's largest democratic exercise - is seen as a significant test. Internet usage in rural areas has exploded since the last election in 2014, fuelled by the world's lowest mobile data prices. In the lead-up to the vote, Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts and pages for misleading users. WhatsApp, meanwhile, has launched a service to verify reports sent in by users and to study the scale of misinformation on the platform. What's the scale of the problem? India poses a particularly complex problem for Facebook. It is WhatsApp's largest market - more than 200 million Indians use the app - and a place where users forward more content than anywhere else in the world. The fact that up to 256 people can be part of a group chat makes it incredibly popular with extended families and large groups of friends. While much of these daily conversations involve people making plans, sharing jokes and catching up - political messages and videos are also shared widely. BBC research last year found that a rising tide of nationalism was driving Indians to share fake news. Participants tended to assume that WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without any checks. Prasanto K Roy, a tech writer, is in a group of more than 100 classmates from his old high school in Delhi. There are Christians and Muslims in the Hindu-majority group. \"In the past year we have been seeing a great deal of polarisation,\" he said. \"A few people were incessantly sending out fake stuff. Some of us would do fact checks and tell them off but we were ignored. Finally they were suspended. Things have improved but it's still tense.\" Many Indians were first introduced to the internet through their smartphones. A recent Reuters Institute survey of English-language Indian internet users found that 52% of respondents got news via WhatsApp. The same proportion said they got their news from Facebook. But content shared via WhatsApp has led to murder. At least 31 people were killed in 2017 and 2018 as a result of mob attacks fuelled by rumours on WhatsApp and social media, a BBC analysis found. What's happening before the election? Both of the main parties - the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the opposition Congress - are exploiting the power of WhatsApp to try to influence India's 900 million eligible voters. Before the campaign began, the BJP had plans to assign some 900,000 people with the specific task of localised WhatsApp campaigning, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported. Congress, the party of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, is focusing on uploading campaign content on Facebook and distributing it via WhatsApp. Both parties have been accused of spreading false or misleading information, or misrepresentation online. On 1 April, Facebook removed 687 pages or accounts that it said were linked to the Congress party for \"co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour\". Pro-BJP Facebook pages - possibly as many as 200 - were also taken down, according to reports, although Facebook did not confirm this. (The social media company did not respond to a request for an explanation). The BJP began setting up WhatsApp groups en masse around 2016 as it saw an opportunity to reach vast numbers of people, said Shivam Shankar Singh, a former BJP data analyst who worked on regional elections in 2017 and 2018. By mapping names on electoral rolls against purchased phone numbers and names, it was able to create groups based on certain demographics - such as caste or religion - and target messaging, he said. Mr Singh, who now works for anti-BJP opposition parties in the state of Bihar, estimated that there were at least 20,000 pro-BJP WhatsApp groups in northern Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. National party spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal denied that the party had any official policy to set up WhatsApp groups - other than to facilitate communication between party workers. He said supporters and members at a local level were allowed to set up groups, but that these had no official link to the party. \"We don't want to control it, it's an open social media platform,\" he said. Why does WhatsApp pose a unique problem? Indian fact-checking websites like AltNews and Boom frequently debunk political posts shared on Facebook and Twitter - such as reports that a British analyst of Indian elections had called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi \"stupid\" or that an air force pilot seen as a national hero had joined Congress. These posts, while not promoted by official party accounts, are often spread widely by unofficial groups or people supporting the parties. They are then sometimes shared by politicians. \"Facebook and Twitter are platforms that do not allow too much secrecy which allows fact-checkers like us to trace who the bad actors are in many of the cases,\" said Jency Jacob, the managing editor of Indian fact-checking site Boom. The difference with WhatsApp is that posts there are private and protected by encryption. Mr Roy likened it to \"something of a black hole\". \"No-one, including WhatsApp itself, gets to see, read, filter or analyse text messages,\" he said. This is unlikely to change - the company said it \"deeply believes in people's ability to communicate privately online\". What has the company done? Amid the furore over mob lynchings last year, WhatsApp limited the number of times a user can forward a message to five. It also now labels forwarded messages. The company has launched a nationwide advertising campaign in 10 languages, which it says has reached hundreds of millions of Indians. It also says that it bans two million accounts globally every month that are sending automated spam messages. New privacy settings also allow users to decide who can add them to groups. Previously any WhatsApp user could be added to a group by any other. Now you can choose to only be added automatically to groups by contacts, or by no-one at all. On 2 April the company announced a new project - Checkpoint - that allows users to send in suspicious messages in English and four Indian languages to a local media start-up Proto for verification. Users are told if the message is true, false, misleading or disputed. It was reported widely as a new fact-checking service but the company has since emphasised that it mostly aims to \"study the misinformation phenomenon\" and that not all users will receive a response. Is it working? While WhatsApp said its moves had decreased forwarded messages by 25%, fact-checkers at other organisations say fake news is still rampant. And they are frustrated that the same rumours and conspiracy theories that they have already debunked - that the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty have Muslim roots, for example - keep resurfacing. They say that unless WhatsApp changes its stance on encryption and privacy, the introduction of features similar to those that exist on Facebook - for example, flagging debunked content to users who try to forward it - is impossible. Critics also point out that new rules on the platform won't affect the huge number of group chats that already exist - giving the party of Prime Minister Modi an advantage. \"The BJP is the only party that has WhatsApp groups at this scale,\" Mr Singh said. \"The other parties can't do it now because WhatsApp has changed its policies.\" Additional reporting by Aparna Alluri",

    "text": "In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care. Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe. It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease. In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children. This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died. They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain. Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues. Doctors are describing it as a \"new phenomenon\" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips. But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications. Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked. \"You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,\" she said. This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection. 'Exceptionally rare' Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home. The syndrome is \"exceptionally rare\", he said. \"This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,\" Prof Viner added. He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease \"might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic\". Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital. Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies. \"So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,\" he said. However Prof Levin said there was \"a vast amount to learn\" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks. Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases. What is the situation elsewhere in the world? There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands. At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week. Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease. All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered. The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids. In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection. Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: \"Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.\" Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children. They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).",

    "text": "By Abigail Ony NwaohuochaBBC Africa women's affairs journalist, Lagos A successful career woman, Olufunmilola Ogungbile, 30, never thought that she would be sleeping on a friend's couch after five months of apartment-hunting in Abeokuta city in south-western Nigeria. She had moved from Lagos after securing a good job with the Ogun state government as a project administrator. Despite being financially independent, she struggled to find an apartment in middle and upmarket areas because she was single. \"The first question the landlord would ask me is if I'm married?\" Ms Ogungbile said, \"I'd say 'No', and they'd follow with, 'Why not'?\" She was often left puzzled. \"What does my marital status have to do with me getting a place to live in?\" 'We want decent people' Ms Ogungbile said the discrimination was widespread. \"Ninety-nine per cent of the landlords I met did not want to rent to me because I am a single woman,\" she told the BBC. \"Most landlords and agents would tell me, 'Can you bring your boyfriend or your husband?' In these kinds of apartments, we don't like boys coming in. We just want decent people.\" Ms Ogungbile believes the hurdles she faced are down to cultural expectations - marriage is a benchmark used to measure decency. \"In this part of the world, if you are not married then you are a prostitute,\" she added. Sylvia Oyinda - a product manager in the retail sector in Lagos, Nigeria's throbbing metropolis - agrees that the stigma makes it difficult for single women to rent in Nigeria. Ms Oyinda, 31, was engaged when she started looking for an apartment. Landlords refused to meet her without her fiancé. \"There is a saying 'small girl, big god' that describes young single women who rent alone or squat with other females. \"The saying refers to single women who have sponsors, typically older men, who pay their rent,\" she said. 'Men have more money' Ms Oyinda believes landlords assume most young single women are like this. \"The three landlords I met all refused to show me their apartments. They would tell me, 'Don't bother.'\" Out of frustration she stopped scouting on her own. On the fourth attempt, she went with her partner, to whom she is now married, and was taken seriously. The couple eventually settled for a four-bedroom flat in the high-end area of Lekki. Olufunmilola Ogungbile on her five-month flat hunt: \"Part of fighting the stigma was me refusing to bring a partner because that was part of the criteria before they would hand me the key\" Coleman Nwafor, a landlord and property owner, said he does not discriminate, but most of his tenants and buyers are men because they have more money. \"Most single ladies are under the responsibility of their parents or a lover. You can never tell what will happen after the first year. And every landlord wants a tenant who will pay without stress and renew their contract once it expires,\" he told the BBC. \"Most single ladies are not working. There are more jobs for men than women in Nigeria. That is just the way it is.\" 'Landlords try to police women' Yinka Oladiran, 25, who moved from New York to Lagos in May 2016 to pursue a career as a TV presenter, said she lived independently in the US and wanted to maintain her freedom in Nigeria. She also wanted to reduce a three-hour commute to work from her father's home, but she could not rent an apartment without her father giving his consent to landlords. \"There were landlords who said they did not want to rent to me until they had spoken to my father to make sure that he was OK with it, even though I was paying with my own money,\" Ms Oladiran told the BBC. \"My opinion didn't matter. The landlords try to police women,\" she added. After searching independently for more than six months, she finally got an apartment in April 2017. More on housing: However, she said she felt constantly undermined by security staff, especially when she came home late from work, as they often asked her who she was visiting. \"For that to even happen over and over again was very insulting,\" Ms Oladiran said. As for Ms Ogungbile, her five-month hunt ended last week when she finally moved into a studio flat. She said she secured it through a letting agency which focused on her income rather than her gender or marital status. The 30-year-old, who is now excited about painting her new home in her favourite colours - purple and lilac - believes she fought back against discrimination in her own little way. \"Part of fighting the stigma was me refusing to bring a spouse or a partner because that was part of the criteria before they would hand me the keys,\" she said.",

    "text": "The Sabarimala temple was historically closed to women of \"menstruating age\" - defined as between 10 and 50. The Supreme Court overturned that ban but protesters then attacked women and stopped them from going in. The women's entry to the shrine sparked fresh protests and police used tear gas at several locations in Kerala. Bindu Ammini, 40, and Kanakadurga, 39, devotees of the temple deity, Lord Ayyappa, entered around dawn. \"We arrived early in the morning and we had a darshan [saw the idol] for a few minutes,\" Ms Ammini told the BBC. Kerala's Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whose government supports the Supreme Court ruling, told reporters that the women's entry into the temple was a historic moment. On 1 January, his left-wing coalition government organised a \"women's wall\" - in which women from across Kerala formed a 620km (385-mile) human chain to protest against the ban. Temple officials say the women have \"defiled\" the temple. It was closed for an hour in order to perform \"purification rituals\" but has now reopened. Demonstrations across the state have since erupted and police have fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Violent clashes have been reported outside the state parliament, according to local media. The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also called for a two-day protest after news of the women entering the shrine broke. How did these women get into the temple? Ms Ammini told the BBC that they began trekking up the hill on Wednesday morning around 1.30 local time (20:00 GMT Tuesday) and reached the shrine in two hours. \"We had no trouble trekking to the shrine and the officials were co-operative,\" she added. \"We left before the protesters spotted us.\" She said that plain-clothed police officers accompanied them. Given the early hour, it's likely there were no protesters and only a few devotees. The presence of the police also helped as temple officials would be breaking the law by refusing to let them enter the temple. The shrine sits atop a steep hill and every year, millions of male devotees make the trek, often barefoot, to visit it. One of the ways to enter the temple is to climb 18 holy steps - a sacred activity requiring a rigorous 41-day fast. Ms Ammini said they did not climb the steps because they did not want to attract the attention of too many devotees and feared they might be attacked. An activist opposed to women entering the temple, Rahul Easwar, told the BBC that \"the police cheated other devotees by claiming the two women are transgender\". Families of the two women have since denied this. Four transgender women, accompanied by police, were allowed to pray inside the Sabarimala shrine in December. Their presence was not met with protests or resistance, police told the BBC. The women, who are now under police protection, can be seen leaving the shrine in videos that have been circulating on WhatsApp. Why are women of a certain age not allowed to enter Sabarimala? Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple is unusual in that it was one of the few that did not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy. Devotees say the ban on women of \"menstruating age\" was in keeping with the wish of the deity who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. Women who had tried to enter following the court ruling had to turn back because of protesters. Police arrested more than 2,000 people in October for rioting and unlawful assembly. Why has the issue become so political? The Kerala state government supports the court verdict and Mr Vijayan has repeatedly said his government will provide the security to enforce it. But India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has argued that the court ruling is an attack on Hindu values. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. Additional reporting by Imran Qureshi and Ashraf Padanna.",

Frisch's pictures capture both the natural landscape and its indigenous inhabitants of among others the Ticuna, Miranha and Caixana tribes. The collection comprises 98 albumen prints which were first published in 1869 by publisher Georg Leuzinger. Frisch took up photography in 1863 and moved to Rio de Janeiro the following year where he started working for Leuzinger. It was he who commissioned Frisch to produce photographs of the undisturbed Amazon. Frisch set off in November 1867 covering nearly 1,000 miles on foot or by boat over the next five months. He produced more than 120 glass plate negatives using the wet collodion process which required him to travel with a portable laboratory. The process meant that the photographic plates had to be prepared moments before they were exposed in the camera with development taking place immediately while they were still wet. Many of the pictures are in fact layered or composite negatives with Frisch often photographing his sitters and backgrounds separately giving the pictures a sculptural feel. Frisch's photographic career only lasted a few years but his prints are still held in a number of collections around the world. All photographs courtesy Albert Frisch / Sothebys",

    "text": "Minor incursion by troops are common on the ill-defined 4,057km (2,520 miles) border between China and India. There are differing perceptions on where the border lies and overlapping claims about the lines up to which both sides patrol. As a result, both Indian and Chinese troops routinely transgress into areas claimed by the other side. According to the Indian Home Ministry, there have been 334 \"transgressions\" by Chinese troops over the Indian border in the first 216 days of this year. Departing from their past practice, however, Indian security forces are now more aggressive with daily patrolling along certain areas on the border and ready to forbid Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de-facto border. This is partly responsible for the increase in stand-offs between the two sides in recent years, but there is a bigger story too. Serious dimension Border incursions have been repeatedly used by China to keep India on the defensive. Before every major bilateral visit, such incursions tend to take a serious dimension. In May 2013, Indian officials accused Chinese troops of straying into Indian territory and putting up tents in the Depsang valley in Ladakh, just before Prime Minister Li Keqiang's visit to India. The matter was resolved days before the visit started. But the latest stand-off coincided with a visit to India by Chinese President Xi Jinping, resulting in embarrassing media headlines. It is possible that after feting Mr Modi's landslide election victory, Beijing was annoyed by his government's foreign policy moves, in particular with Mr Modi condemning \"18th century expansionist mindset: encroaching on other countries, intruding in other's waters, invading other countries and capturing territory\" during his recent trip to Japan and India, giving a boost to its ties with Japan and Vietnam days before Mr Xi's visit. The Chinese forces might also be probing Indian defences along the disputed border and testing India's willpower to stay the course. The Chinese have invested in border infrastructure much more efficiently than India, where border management continues to suffer from serious deficiencies. With its repeated transgressions, Beijing has underscored Indian vulnerabilities and the potential costs of challenging China. And with every intrusion, China changes the ground realities at the border, gaining ever more territory in the process and redrawing the map in its favour. However, it is not readily evident if such an approach would benefit China strategically. Damp squib Many believe China has failed to use the opportunity that Mr Modi coming to power gave to Beijing to re-examine the assumptions of its bilateral ties with India. Mr Xi's visit was widely viewed in India as a damp squib. Even on the economic front, the visit was a disappointment. There were media reports in India of China pledging $100bn (£61bn) of investment in India. However, only $20bn-worth of deals could be finalised over the next five years. Officially, Beijing has maintained that Mr Xi's visit to India helped in removing \"some suspicions\" between the two nations, pushed the ties to a \"new age\", and that an \"important consensus\" was reached on politically resolving the border issue through friendly consultation. But on the eve of his visit to the US, Mr Modi is challenging Beijing by asserting that India cannot close its eyes to problems underscoring that \"we are not living in the 18th Century\". Given the turmoil it faces on its eastern flank, it is in China's interest to ensure that India does not join the US-led balancing coalition in Asia. But with its hard line on the border issue, Beijing might just push New Delhi into a tighter embrace of Japan and the US.

    "text": "By Liza TambunanBBC News Indonesian Citra* thought it was just a work meeting. Two men, claiming to be local officials, said they wanted to go over budgets for a project she was running at a local aid agency. The then 28-year-old was slightly nervous about going alone but keen to distinguish herself at work, so she pushed such concerns aside. An hour in, the men suggested the meeting continue at a different location and invited her to ride in their car. Insisting on taking her own motorbike she went to slide her key into the ignition, when suddenly another group of men grabbed her. \"I was kicking and screaming, as they pushed me into the car. I was helpless. Inside two people held me down,\" she says. \"I knew what was happening.\" She was being captured in order to be wed. Bride kidnapping, or kawin tangkap, is a controversial practice in Sumba with disputed origins which sees women taken by force by family members or friends of men who want to marry them. Despite long-standing calls for it to be banned by women's rights groups, it continues to be carried out in certain parts of Sumba, a remote Indonesian island east of Bali. But after two bride kidnappings were captured on video and widely shared on social media, the central government is now calling for it to end. 'It felt like I was dying' Inside the car, Citra managed to message her boyfriend and parents before arriving at a traditional house, with its high peaked roof and solid wooden pillars. The family who kidnapped her, she then realised, were distant relatives from her father's side. \"There were lots of people waiting there. They sounded a gong as I arrived and started doing rituals.\" An ancient animist religion, known as Marapu, is widely practised in Sumba alongside Christianity and Islam. To keep the world in balance, spirits are appeased by ceremonies and sacrifices. \"In Sumba, people believe that when water touches your forehead you cannot leave the house,\" Citra said. \"I was very aware of what was happening, so when they tried to do that I turned at the last minute so that the water didn't touch my forehead.\" Her captors told her repeatedly that they were acting out of love for her and tried to woo her into accepting the marriage. \"I cried until my throat was dry. I threw myself on the ground. I kept jabbing the motorbike key that I was holding into my stomach until it bruised. I hit my head against the large wooden pillars. I wanted them to understand I didn't want this. I hoped they would feel sorry for me.\" For the next six days she was kept, effectively a prisoner in their house, sleeping in the living room. \"I cried all night, and I didn't sleep. It felt like I was dying.\" Citra refused to eat or drink anything the family offered her believing it would put her under a spell: \"If we take their food, we would say yes to the marriage.\" Her sister smuggled food and water to her while her family, with the support of women's rights groups, negotiated her release with village elders and the family of the potential groom. No position to negotiate Women's rights group Peruati has documented seven such bride kidnappings in the last four years, and believe many more have taken place in remote areas of the island. Just three women, including Citra, ended up being freed. In the two most recent cases that were captured on video in June, one woman stayed in the marriage. \"They stayed because they didn't have a choice,\" says activist Aprissa Taranau, the local head of Peruati. \"Kawin tangkap can sometimes be a form of arranged marriage and women are not in a position to negotiate.\" She says those that do manage to leave are often stigmatised by their community. \"They're labelled as a disgrace and people say they will not be able to get married now or have children. So women stay because of a fear of that,\" she says. That is what Citra was told. \"Thank God I am now married to my boyfriend and we have a one-year old child,\" she says with a smile, three years on from her ordeal. Promises to outlaw the practice Local historian and elder Frans Wora Hebi argues the practice is not part of Sumba's rich cultural traditions and says it is used by people wanting to force women to marry them without consequences. A lack of firm action by custodial leaders and the authorities means the practice continues, he says. \"There are no laws against it, only sometimes there is social reprimand against those who practice it but there is no legal or cultural deterrent.\" Following a national outcry, regional leaders in Sumba signed a joint declaration rejecting the practice early this month. Women's Empowerment Minister Bintang Puspayoga flew to the island from the capital, Jakarta, to attend. Speaking to the media after the event she said: \"We have heard from custodial leaders and religious leaders, that the practice of capture and wed that went viral is not truly part of Sumba's traditions.\" She promised that the declaration was the beginning of a wider government effort to end the practice that she described as violence against women. Rights groups have welcomed the move but described it as \"a first step in a long journey\". Citra says she is grateful that the government is now paying attention to the practice and hopes, as a result, no one will have to go through what she did. \"For some this may be a tradition from our ancestors. But it's an out of date custom that must stop because it's very damaging to women.\" *Citra's name has been changed to protect her identity. You may also be interested in:",

Malaysia Airlines warned on Thursday that it had seen a sharp decline in weekly bookings following the two air disasters. However, the company has been in trouble over the past few years, and has lost billions of ringgit in that time. The firm will be completely delisted from the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange by the end of 2014. Relevant assets, operations and liabilities of Malaysia Airlines will be transferred to a new company by 1 July 2015. The current chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, will continue to lead the firm until the new company is formed next year. Travel expert Simon Calder said that the staff cuts and business reorganisation should allow the company to turn its fortunes around. \"There is a slice of business to have, but nothing like the scale and dominance it once enjoyed,\" he said. Competition from low-cost airlines for short-haul flights, coupled with the expansion of long-haul Gulf carriers, had eaten into the firm's profitability in the past, he added.",

The move comes just days after Alibaba said it was breaking up its business into 25 different units that will be led by different executives. Alibaba, founded in 1999, is one of the world's biggest online companies. \"I see that Alibaba's young people have better, more brilliant, dreams than mine, and they are more capable of building a future that belongs to them,\" Mr Ma said in the letter, adding that the decision had been a difficult one. Alibaba Group is the parent company behind Alibaba.com, an online marketplace for small businesses, Taobao, a shopping site for consumers as well as Alipay, an online payment service. 'Biggest challenge' China is the world's biggest internet market with more than 500 million users. The size of the market is expected to grow even further as more users in rural areas get access to the internet. Alibaba, one of the early entrants in the market and one that has benefited tremendously from the boom, has said that it was restructuring its business to ensure that it continues to grow and dominate the market. Analysts said that ensuring a smooth transition in the business model will be key to the next chief executive's success. \"The biggest challenge a new chief executive officer faces is making sure the new business units can effectively coordinate among themselves,\" said Yang Xiao, a Beijing-based analyst with research firm Analysys International. \"As they are supposed to be able to work independently, it remains to be seen how effective and authoritative the new CEO can be.\" However, other analysts were of the opinion that despite stepping down as the boss, Mr Ma will continue to have a big say in the firm. \"Jack Ma may not be running the day-to-day activities... he will still have an influence in where the company should be headed,\" Frederick Wong, executive director of Avant Capital Management (HK).",

    "text": "Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter This was the essential message from President Donald Trump's address. His stress on abandoning timetables and moving to a \"conditions-based approach\" as he called it, means that US troops will be in Afghanistan for a considerable time to come. The decision on a new Afghan strategy was much delayed, but after much prevarication he has essentially followed the line of his senior military advisers. He refused to give any numbers as to additional troops and so on, but the plan backed by his generals is thought to involve the despatch of some 3,800 additional military trainers and advisers to the country - so it is likely that this is part of what will happen. US air support - crucial in helping Afghan government forces to withstand Taliban pressure on the battlefield - may also be stepped up, but here too President Trump was playing his cards close to his chest. In rejecting some of the less conventional policy options like a total US withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the turning over of the mission lock, stock and barrel to a private contractor, President Trump has effectively taken ownership of America's longest running war. Mr Trump admitted that his instinct was to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan altogether. But having grappled with the self-same problems as his predecessor Barack Obama he has come up with a broadly similar answer - more training and assistance for the Afghan forces to help them resist Taliban advances. Of course Mr Trump inevitably tried to present this policy as a new departure. A conditions-based strategy means the US is involved for the long haul. Things are not going well for government forces. The Taliban hold almost half of the country and the Afghan military's performance - other than its elite special forces - is patchy at best. So there is a lot to do just to stabilise the situation before even thinking about the Afghan government forces going back onto the offensive. It was all wrapped up in typical Trump rhetoric - the talk of \"victory\", the insistence that the war in Afghanistan was not about nation-building but about \"killing terrorists\" as he put it. This was no doubt an effort to reassure his political base who are as sceptical about foreign military adventures as Mr Trump has always been. Mr Trump proposed an integrated approach - military, political and diplomatic. He had tough words for Pakistan who he said \"had much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists. That will change and change immediately,\" he asserted. But just how much pressure is he able to exert on Islamabad? Some US security assistance funds have already been suspended. But Pakistan - half-ally, half-problem for Washington - is also the prime intermediary with the Taliban - a group at least parts of which, Mr Trump hoped one day, possibly, to bring to the negotiating table. Mr Trump's stress on building up the US-Indian relationship and on what India might offer Afghanistan in terms of economic development was at least a stab at a wider regional approach - but one also intended to ring alarm bells in Pakistan. There were tough words too for the Afghan authorities. Riven by factionalism and corruption, the Afghan government is no poster-child for democratic values. Mr Trump said that he wasn't going to dictate how the Afghans should rule themselves. But in almost the same breath he said Washington was not offering the Kabul government a blank cheque. \"Our support is not unlimited,\" he said. \"Americans expect,\" he said, \"real reforms, real progress and real results.\" Rare praise to Nato President Trump's decision has implications for a number of other countries, not least Washington's Nato allies. The call already went out to Nato capitals before the summer for them to increase their contributions to the US-led force. Britain, which already has some 500 troops in Afghanistan - mainly in and around Kabul - has already agreed to despatch a further 85 personnel. Like the other international forces and the bulk of the US troops they are not engaged in combat but in supporting, training and mentoring the fledgling Afghan forces. UK Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon welcomed the Trump announcement noting \"we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy\". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg similarly welcomed the Trump speech noting that the alliance currently has over 12,000 troops in the country and that over recent weeks some 15 allies have pledged additional contributions. In his address President Trump - a longstanding critic of Nato - had some rare words of praise for the alliance noting that \"we told them to contribute more and they have done so\". So these then are the broad lines of the Trump vision for an Afghan policy. The details? Well, they will become apparent later. It is the moment when the Trump rhetoric came up against the Afghan reality, and the Afghan reality has probably won. Afghanistan has now become Mr Trump's war. He faced the same set of bad options faced by his predecessors. And whatever the rhetoric he seems to have set a broadly similar course, except that he insists he will be tougher and that he will get results.",

    "text": "Yago Riedijk and Ms Begum married days after she arrived inside IS territory. Speaking to the BBC, he admitted fighting for the group but says he now wants to return home with his wife and their newborn son. Mr Riedijk, 27, is being held in a Kurdish detention centre in north-eastern Syria. He faces a six-year jail term for joining a terror organisation if he returns to the Netherlands. In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, Mr Riedijk said he rejected IS and had tried to leave the group. He told our correspondent that he was imprisoned in Raqqa and tortured after the extremists accused him of being a Dutch spy. Describing life under IS control, Mr Riedijk also said he attended the stoning of a woman for \"fornication\", saw piles of dead bodies in the city and lost an infant daughter to malnutrition. 'Tell her that I love her' By BBC Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville He sits opposite me in a yellow plastic chair, 27 years old now, in a freezing interview room in a Kurdish detention centre. His guards have just removed his handcuffs. If I see Shamima, he asks me to \"tell her that I love her and have patience\". \"Hopefully soon we'll be together again and things will turn out alright, hopefully.\" It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon. Over the next hour, he paints a contradictory picture of an insulated home life, and a maelstrom of terror outside. Read more from Quentin here. Ms Begum, now aged 19, escaped with her IS fighter husband from the town of Baghuz, the group's last territory in eastern Syria, as the caliphate crumbled. Mr Riedijk surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters, and Ms Begum and their newborn son, Jarrah, ended up among 39,000 people in the al-Hol refugee camp in northern Syria. She has now reportedly gone elsewhere. Mr Riedijk also told the BBC he saw nothing wrong with marrying Ms Begum - 15 at the time, while he was 23 - because it was \"her choice\". Describing how he met the schoolgirl from east London in the women's centre in Raqqa, he said he was initially not interested because she was too young. He said: \"To be honest, when my friend came and said there was a girl who was interested in marriage, I wasn't that interested because of her age, but I accepted the offer anyway.\" He added that she had seemed to be \"in a good state of mind\". Mr Riedijk, from Arnhem in the Netherlands, insisted: \"It was her own choice. She asked to look for a partner for her, and I was invited.\" He conceded \"she was very young, maybe it would have been better for her to wait a bit\", before adding: \"But she didn't, she chose to get married and I chose to marry her.\" Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside Amira Abase, also 15 at the time, and Kadiza Sultana, who was 16. Ms Sultana is believed to have been killed in an air strike in 2016. The UK has revoked Ms Begum's citizenship on the grounds that she is a Bangladeshi national through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. But Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has disputed this, saying Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and that she will not be allowed into the country. And, last month, Ms Begum's family told the home secretary they were going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Shamima Begum's sister Renu said they could not \"simply abandon her\" and asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said Ms Begum had a \"right to return to Britain\" - and called the decision to revoke her citizenship \"extreme\". Although Mr Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his Dutch citizenship has not been revoked. However, BBC foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said Ms Begum would struggle to get her underage marriage recognised in the Netherlands, and any application for a residence permit would be jeopardised by the fact that she too was suspected of terrorism crimes. Their newborn son though, might be entitled to Dutch citizenship through his father, she added. Recently, the Dutch justice department has warned of the threat posed by jihadist women returning from abroad. It said even women and children, who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities, could pose a \"long-term potential threat\" because of exposure to IS ideology. Mr Riedijk was born and raised in Dutch suburbia but abandoned his life in 2014 to join IS. He was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq, our correspondent said. Of those, some 135 Dutch nationals with \"jihadist intentions\" are still there, according to anti-terrorism officials. It is not known how many want to come back, but last week the Netherlands removed the citizenship of another Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B. The Dutch justice ministry has said those wishing to return will receive no government help. It added, however, that if Mr Riedijk turned himself in at a Dutch embassy or consulate he would be sent back to the Netherlands to serve his six-year prison term.",

    "text": "An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC \"all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at\". He said \"the right balance\" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: \"The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it.\" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: \"I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?\" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: \"This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true.\" The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: \"My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law.\" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: \"I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? \"My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place.\" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. \"Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute.\" \"The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations.\" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted \"to have accountability where there's wrongdoing\". He said: \"What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance.\" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are \"some of the most rigorous in the world\". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as \"flawed, baseless and biased\". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a \"witch hunt against our brave servicemen\" which \"had no credibility whatsoever\". She added: \"Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.\" Panorama, War Crimes Scandal Exposed is on BBC One at 21:00 GMT on Monday 18 November.",

    "text": "By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing At night, while travelling for hours along Xinjiang's desert highways, the unmarked cars that had been following us from the moment we arrived would tailgate us at speed, driving dangerously close with their headlights on full beam. Their occupants - who never identified themselves - forced us to leave one city by chasing us out of restaurants and shops, ordering the owners not to serve us. The report we produced, despite these difficulties, contained new evidence - much of it based on China's own policy documents - that thousands of Uighurs and other minorities are being forced to pick cotton in a region responsible for a fifth of the world's crop. But now China's Communist Party-run media have produced their own report about our reporting, accusing the BBC of exaggerating these efforts by the authorities to obstruct our team and calling it \"fake news\". The video, made by the China Daily - an English-language newspaper - has been posted on both Chinese social media sites, as well as international platforms banned in China. Hannah Bailey, who specialises in China's use of state-sponsored digital disinformation at the Oxford Internet Institute, suggests that such a fiercely critical attack in English, but with Chinese subtitles, makes it unusual. \"It has clearly been produced with both international and domestic users in mind,\" she told me, \"which is somewhat of a departure from previous strategies. \"Previous content produced for mainland audiences has been more critical of Western countries, and more vocally nationalistic, whereas content produced for international audiences has struck a more conciliatory tone.\" The China Daily report focuses on an altercation outside the front gate of a textile factory in the city of Kuqa, where the BBC team was surrounded by a group of managers and local officials. The allegations it contains, based on body camera recordings provided by the police who arrived at the scene, are easily dismissed. A polite exchange between our team and a police officer is used to suggest that the BBC exaggerated the role of the authorities in preventing us from reporting. But the China Daily chooses not to mention that some of our footage was forcibly deleted and we were made to accompany the same police officer to another location so she could review the remaining pictures. And it provides no explanation of the wider context, nor gives the BBC any right of reply. Over a period of less than 72 hours in Xinjiang we were followed constantly and, on five separate occasions, approached by people who attempted to stop us from filming in public, sometimes violently. In at least two instances, we were accused of breaching the privacy of these individuals on the basis that their attempts to stop us had led them to walk in front of our camera. The uniformed police officers attending these \"incidents\" twice deleted our footage and, on another occasion, we were briefly held by local officials who claimed we'd infringed a farmer's rights by filming a field. China's propaganda efforts may be a sign of just how damaging it believes the coverage of Xinjiang has been to its international reputation. But attempting to attack the - usually censored - Western media at home carries some risk, in that it can reveal glimpses of stories that would otherwise remain out of the public domain. A satellite photo, dated May 2019, shows a large group of people being moved between the Kuqa textile factory and a re-education camp located next door, complete with a watchtower and internal security walls. The China Daily, which refers to the camp by the official terminology as a \"Vocational Training Centre\" suggests our attempt to film was pointless because, they say, it closed in October 2019. If true, this simply proves that the camp was operational when the image was taken - and confirms it to be compelling grounds for further investigation. Now Chinese and Western audiences alike can ponder who the people in the photograph were, why they were being moved between the camp and the factory and whether any work they did there was likely to be fully voluntary. More coverage of China's hidden camps In an interview with one of the uniformed police officers who provided the body camera recordings, the China Daily video inadvertently provides corroboration of just how well-planned and multi-layered the control of journalists in Xinjiang really is. The officer confirms that, shortly after our arrival in Kuqa, she summoned us to a meeting in our hotel lobby to issue a warning about \"our rights and restrictions\". In fact, hotel staff told us we were forbidden to leave the hotel until after this meeting had taken place. It was also attended by two propaganda officials who were assigned to accompany us for the rest of our time in Kuqa - adding one more car to the long line that followed us wherever we went. Far from being fake news, our evidence, along with the post-publication propaganda designed to undermine it, is proof of a co-ordinated effort to control the narrative, extending from the shadowy minders in unmarked cars, all the way up to the national government. Upon our return to Beijing we were summoned to a meeting with officials who insisted that we should have sought permission from the owners of the factory before filming it. We pointed out that China's own media regulations do not prohibit the filming of a building from a public road. China is increasingly using the accreditation process for foreign journalists as a tool of control, issuing shortened visas and threats of non-renewal for those whose coverage it disapproves of. Following publication, I was given another shortened visa with the authorities making clear that it was as a result of my reporting on Xinjiang. The China Daily also accuses the BBC of using a hidden camera - we didn't. And it misrepresents the recording from the police body cameras by suggesting a comment made by BBC producer Kathy Long outside the factory, that we wouldn't use images of one man, were instead made in regard to someone else. Presuming they're in possession of the full recording it is hard to understand how this mistake could be made. Hannah Bailey from the Oxford Internet Institute says, like China's domestic propaganda, its international push-back may be becoming \"increasingly critical and defensive\". \"China has previously demonstrated its use of a variety of tools to manipulate international and domestic discourse, from Twitter bots to state-controlled international media outlets to the vocal so-called \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomats,\" she told me. \"Attempts to discredit foreign media are also a part of this toolkit.\" We offered the China Daily the opportunity to comment on the errors in its reporting. In a reply, which failed to address our specific questions, it said that having visited Xinjiang and conducted interviews it has concluded that \"there is no forced labour in Xinjiang\". Its propaganda video ends with a worker in the Kuqa textile factory being asked why she's there - a question that comes, she will know full well, from reporters under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party. \"I chose to work here,\" she tells them.

    "text": "By Paul AdamsBBC News The number of people attempting the dangerous sea crossing from North Africa to Italy has risen sharply, says Frontex, the EU border agency. From January to April, 42,000 migrants were detected on these routes, with 25,650 of these crossing from Libya. Combined with seven other less busy routes, the total figure for this year is probably now about 60,000. On Wednesday, the Italian government said the number of refugees and other migrants reaching its shores had soared to more than 39,000. The total for 2014 so far is more than the equivalent period in 2011, the year of the Arab Spring, which eventually saw 140,000 make clandestine crossings into Europe. \"If the current trends continue, and with the summer months approaching, there is a strong likelihood the numbers will increase further,\" says Gil Arias Fernandez, Frontex's Deputy Executive Director. At least a third of the latest arrivals are Syrians, fleeing that country's civil war. But other significant numbers are coming from Afghanistan and Eritrea. In Calais, where the French authorities this week demolished two main squatter camps, the BBC found migrants from a host of countries, from West Africa to Bangladesh, with large groups from Iran and Pakistan's restive tribal areas. Tracking one of the biggest migrations since World War Two Almost three million people have fled Syria's bloody civil war. UN figures show the human tide began in earnest in early 2012. Experts say the latest numbers are not surprising, after relatively low levels of migration in the early months of 2013. \"The main route through Libya was closed for so long that people in sub-Saharan countries have been waiting for a couple of years,\" says Franck Duvell, associate professor at the Centre on Migration, Policy, and Society at the University of Oxford. \"So the numbers have been building up and people were waiting for the very first opportunity to move,\" he says. \"I'm not sure this implies that we are going to see ever-more people arriving in the EU over the next couple of months. We've got to wait and see.\" Much depends on the chaotic political and security situation in Libya, where a BBC team has recently seen evidence that large numbers of migrants are still waiting to cross. Some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000. Italy complains that since last October, when it launched its \"Mare Nostrum\" [Our Sea] rescue operation, the cost of patrolling its patch of the Mediterranean has risen to 300,000 euros (£240,200: $408,000) a day.",

    "text": "The North Korean leader earlier labelled Mr Trump \"mentally deranged\" and a \"dotard\" after Mr Trump threatened to destroy his country. Mr Trump responded with a tweet calling Kim Jong-un \"a madman\" who \"will be tested like never before!\" Moscow's Sergei Lavrov said a pause was needed, \"to calm down the hotheads\". \"Yes, it's unacceptable to silently watch North Korea's nuclear military adventures but it is also unacceptable to unleash war on the Korean Peninsula,\" he said. He called for a political process, which he said was a key part of the United Nations Security Council process. \"Together with China we'll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them,\" he said. The North Korean leader had attacked Donald Trump days after his speech at the UN, in which the US president said he would \"totally destroy\" North Korea if the US was forced to defend itself or its allies. He also mocked Kim Jong-un with a disparaging nickname, saying: \"Rocket man is on a suicide mission.\" But the North Korean leader said remarks by the \"deranged\" US president convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. In an unprecedented personal statement, Mr Kim said Mr Trump would \"pay dearly\" for his speech, which he labelled \"unprecedented rude nonsense\". He said Mr Trump had insulted his country in the eyes of the world, and threatened to \"surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.\" Experts say this is the first time a North Korean leader has made a direct address to an international audience - and it merits serious and thorough consideration. China also urged a calming of the heated rhetoric on both sides, saying the issue was \"complicated and sensitive\". \"All relevant parties should exercise restraint instead of provoking each other,\" said Foreign Minister spokesman Lu Kang. North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has demonstrated unprecedented progress this year. It recently conducted its sixth nuclear test and now claims it has miniaturised a nuclear warhead to fit on a long-range missile. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho earlier warned that Pyongyang could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in response to the US president's threat. That would demonstrate North Korea's claimed thermonuclear capability as a credible threat. But the risk of such a move would be very high. It is not certain that missile defence systems in the Pacific could intercept the missile, and the risk of accidentally striking Japan - over which recent tests have flown - could spark a serious conflict. Earlier, Mr Kim's comments had prompted swift criticism from the Japanese government. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a news conference on Friday: \"North Korea's remarks and behaviour are provocative to regional and international security, and they are absolutely unacceptable.\" Mr Trump on Thursday signed a new order boosting sanctions against North Korea, where the US treasury would target firms and financial institutions doing business with Pyongyang. He said: \"For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs.\" The UN Security Council had approved new rounds of sanctions earlier this month aimed at starving North Korea of fuel and income, which were in response to Pyongyang's much-condemned sixth nuclear test on 3 September.",

Blackouts will continue throughout the exam season, from 20-25 June. The move follows widespread cheating in 2016, with questions leaked online before and during tests. As a result, the authorities asked internet service providers to stop social media access last year, but the voluntary measures were not enough. Education Minister Nouria Benghabrit told Algerian newspaper Annahar that Facebook would be blocked across the country throughout the entire period. Ms Benghabrit said while they are \"not comfortable\" with the decision, \"we should not passively stand in front of such a possible leak\". Additionally, all electronic devices with internet access - for both students and school staff - have been banned from the country's 2,000 exam halls, with metal detectors set up at their entrances. Ms Benghrabit also said surveillance cameras and mobile phone jammers had been installed at exam printing presses. Just over 700,000 students will sit the high school certificate examinations over the next week, with results expected from 22 July. You may also be interested in:",

    "text": "Officials say he helped set up and fund an Islamic militant training camp in Aceh, uncovered by police in February. Mr Ba'asyir told reporters outside police headquarters in Jakarta that his arrest had been arranged by the US. Mr Ba'asyir had previously served 26 months in jail before being cleared of involvement with Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the group behind the 2002 Bali attacks. The 71-year-old was imprisoned for conspiracy over the bombings, in which 202 people died. However, his conviction was overturned and he was released in 2006. He has been accused of giving spiritual leadership to JI, which has links to al-Qaeda - a claim he denies. 'Significant allegations' Mr Ba'asyir was arrested in West Java by anti-terror police but has not yet been formally charged. Under Indonesia's anti-terror laws police can question him for up to a week without filing charges. Ansyaad Mbai, the head of Indonesia's anti-terror unit, told the BBC that Mr Ba'asyir was detained on terrorism charges. \"He had been involved in terror network in Aceh. As we know, that terror group in Aceh is linked with Jemaah Islamiah and many other extremist groups in our country,\" Mr Mbai told reporters. \"One of the allegations is that he provided funding to the Aceh military training camp. It's one of many allegations weighed against him,\" he said. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta quoted police as saying that Mr Ba'asyir played an active role in setting up the camp, appointing key people and receiving reports from extremists in the field. Our correspondent says these are very different allegations being levelled against Mr Ba'asyir, who in the past has been linked to extremism in a spiritual and moral capacity but not in the planning or creation of a terror network. Arriving at Jakarta police headquarters, Mr Ba'asyir said: \"This is God's grace to reduce sin. This is engineered by America.\" Mr Ba'asyir's son, Abdul Rohim, appealed for the fair treatment of his father and said his mother had also been detained. \"We appeal to police to treat my parents well. He is innocent, he was just carrying out his obligations as a Muslim,\" his son said. 'New front in extremism' Mr Ba'asyir is the leader of the hardline Islamist group Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), which was created in 2008. It was recently described in a report by the Brussels-based think tank, International Crisis Group (ICG) as an \"above-ground organisation\" that embraced individuals with known ties to fugitive extremists. The ICG believes there are links between JAT and the militant training camp uncovered in Aceh earlier this year. Mr Ba'asyir denied having any links to the Aceh camp. Officials believe this group had plans to launch a brazen attack on Indonesia, similar to the type of assault seen in Mumbai, India, in November 2008, when Islamist militants killed 166 people. JAT has denied it has any connection to extremism and insists it is a legitimate Islamic organisation.",

    "text": "By Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News, Mizoram \"I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't.\" For nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety - served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Now, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram. I met him, and a group of policemen and women in their twenties, who say they ran away from their jobs back home, after refusing to carry out orders. \"I was afraid that I would be forced to kill or harm innocent people who are protesting against the military,\" one officer said. \"We feel that it was wrong for the military to overthrow an elected government.\" Ever since the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power on 1 February, thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets. Security forces have been accused of killing more than 50 people. Naing, who is a low-ranking officer from a town in the west of the country, says protests in his area began to escalate at the end of February. He says he ran, after refusing twice to fire at demonstrators. \"I told my boss I couldn't do that, and that I was going to side with the people. \"The military is edgy. They are becoming more and more brutal.\" As we speak, Naing pulls out his phone to show me photos of the family he left behind - a wife, and two daughters aged just five and six months. \"I am worried that it may not be possible to meet them again,\" he told me. I met him and the rest of the group in an undisclosed location, overlooking the hills and valleys of the mountainous state of Mizoram, their home country of Myanmar less than 10 miles (16km) away from where we were chatting. The officers we spoke to are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside the country. They say they're part of a growing number of officials who are joining the pro-democracy, civil disobedience movement (CDM) in the country. The BBC was unable to independently verify any of the claims made by the police who spoke to us. The UN, the US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions and said it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after it seized power. According to local officials, more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup. Htut - not his real name - recalls the night the military junta overthrew the government, after the internet was shut down and an army post was erected close to his station. \"A few hours later we learned the military had staged a coup.\" Htut, who is 22, says he and other police were paired with members of the military as they patrolled the streets. Protesters who were peacefully banging utensils in support of the pro-democracy movement were threatened with arrest. Htut, who is from a large city in Myanmar, says he too was asked to fire at protesters, a demand he refused. \"The military officer in charge ordered us to shoot people coming out in groups of more than five. I know that people were beaten up. I had sleepless nights. \"When I saw innocent people bleeding, my conscience wouldn't permit me to take part in such evil acts.\" Htut says he was the only one from his police station to flee, making the journey by motorbike. He says he was terrified as he passed from village to village to reach the border with India. Those we spoke to crossed into India over the Tiau river, which we visited. The 250-mile stretch of river forms part of the boundary between India and Myanmar. Groups we've spoken to say they expect more police to make this journey to India in the coming days. Grace, whose name we have changed, is one of two female police officers we met who has defected. She said she saw the military use sticks and rubber bullets to round up protesters, and on one occasion tear gas being fired into a group which included children. \"They wanted us to disperse the crowds, and arrest our friends, but we couldn't do it,\" she said. \"We love the police, but now the system has changed, we can't continue our job.\" The 24-year-old says she also wrestled with leaving her family back home, in particular her mother who has a serious heart condition. \"My parents are old, and they're also afraid. But we young people have no choice but to flee and leave them behind.\" Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return any defectors, to \"uphold friendly relations\". Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said those who have arrived should be given temporary shelter, while the national government decides what to do next. Local groups have told us they expect many more defectors to make the journey to India in the coming days. It's just not police officers who have fled. We met a shopkeeper who escaped to Mizoram, after authorities in Myanmar issued him with a warrant for rallying supporters online to join the pro-democracy movement. \"I'm not running away selfishly,\" he said, explaining why he risked it all to leave. \"Everyone inside the country is worried. \"I'm here for safety, and will continue to do what I can to support the movement, from this side.\" Myanmar in profile Additional reporting: Aakriti Thapar, Sanjay Ganguly, HC Vanlalruata Follow Rajini on Twitter - @BBCRajiniV",

    "text": "Former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, and BJP leaders MM Joshi and Uma Bharti, had denied charges of inciting extremists to demolish the 16th Century Babri mosque in the town of Ayodhya. The demolition sparked violence that killed some 2,000 people. It was also a pivotal moment in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing. Wednesday's verdict acquitted 32 of the 49 people charged - 17 had died while the case was under way. The court said there was insufficient evidence to prove the demolition had been planned. Hindus believe the mosque was built over the birthplace of their deity Lord Ram. The controversial verdict comes nearly a year after another historic judgment over the site of the mosque. Last year, the Supreme Court gave the land to Hindus, ending a decades-long legal battle. It gave Muslims another plot of land in Ayodhya on which to construct a mosque. In August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a Hindu temple at the site - a core promise made by his BJP and a hugely symbolic moment for its strident Hindu nationalist base. How was the verdict greeted? Muslim groups and opposition parties criticised the acquittals. The influential All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which represents Muslim social and political groups in India, said it would appeal against the ruling in the high court. \"There were police officers, government officials and senior journalists who appeared as witnesses. What about their testimony? The court should have said whether these eyewitnesses were lying,\" the board's lawyer, Zafaryab Jilani, told the BBC. Many political observers believe the verdict is likely to add to the feeling of discontent and marginalisation among India's 200-million Muslim minority. Opposition leaders and some political commentators decried the ruling. Congress party's Randeep Surjewala called it an \"egregious violation of the law\" that ran counter to \"the constitutional spirit\", and Sitaram Yehchury, from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said it was \"a complete travesty of Justice\". MP Asaduddin Owaisi told BBC Telugu he was \"pained\" at the verdict and called it \"a black day for [the] judiciary\". \"Was it some magic that the masjid [mosque] got demolished? It seems violent acts pay politically.\" Mr Advani, now 92, said he \"wholeheartedly welcomed\" the verdict. Mr Joshi, now 86, said it was \"a historic decision\" that proved that \"no conspiracy was hatched\" to bring down the mosque. Neither they nor Ms Bharti, 61, attended court - they watched the verdict by video. Iqbal Ansari, the petitioner in the case over the ownership of the disputed site, said: \"It's good that this is now over.\" \"Let's all live in peace. Let there be no fresh trouble of this nature. Hindu and Muslim have always lived in peace in Ayodhya.\" A perilous time for India's judiciary Soutik Biswas, BBC News Nearly three decades after the demolition of the Babri mosque and a torturously slow judicial process, Wednesday's verdict, many say, is along expected lines. Federal investigators interviewed nearly 850 witnesses and examined 7,000 documents and TV footage and photos of what happened on the day to help them frame charges against 49 people, including top BJP leaders. All their efforts have come to naught despite numerous credible eyewitness accounts that the tearing down of the mosque had been planned, rehearsed and carried out with impunity and the connivance of a section of the local police in front of thousands of people. Last year, even the Supreme Court said the demolition had been a \"calculated act\" and an \"egregious violation of law\". The fact that nobody could be held guilty for the violence is testimony to the perilous state of India's criminal justice system, which many say has been compromised beyond repair by brazen political interference. It also points to the failure of all political parties to uphold justice. The verdict will further deepen anxieties and a sense of injustice for India's Muslims. When the \"most blatant act of defiance of law in modern India\", as political scientist Zoya Hasan described the demolition, goes unpunished, what hope does the common Indian, especially if he belongs to a minority, have in securing justice? What happened on 6 December 1992? It began as a religious procession organised by right-wing Hindu groups, including the then main opposition BJP. They had long pledged to build a temple at the disputed site where the Babri mosque stood. The groups had vowed that the gathering on that day would be symbolic - there would be a religious ceremony, and no damage would be done to the mosque. The BBC's Mark Tully, who witnessed what happened, wrote that a vast crowd, perhaps 150,000 strong, had gathered and was listening to speeches given by BJP and right-wing leaders. Mr Advani and Mr Joshi, who would become prominent figures in the later BJP-led government of Atal Behari Vajpayee, who died in 2018, were present. And at some point, thousands of young men, armed with shovels, hammers, iron rods and pick axes charged towards the outer cordon of police protecting the mosque, scrambled on top of the mosque's central dome and started hacking away at the mortar. Soon, the mosque was razed to the ground. Photographer Praveen Jain said that the mob had attacked journalists, breaking photographers' cameras to wipe out evidence of the demolition. Within hours, Hindu-Muslim riots broke out in different parts of India. The worst violence was in Mumbai, where an estimated 900 people were killed. What were the charges? The three BJP leader defendants were charged with \"giving provocative speeches leading to demolition of the mosque, creating enmity between Hindus and Muslims and inciting people for riots and public mischief\". India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which investigated the case, has always maintained that the destruction was a planned event. An inquiry commission led by former high court judge MS Liberhan, concluded the same after 17 years, according to Indian media reports. Muslim leaders also alleged the demolition had been a planned move by Mr Advani, who was leader of the opposition at the time. Why is this verdict important? Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions. Calls for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya had grown louder and louder until the country's top court last year awarded the disputed site to Hindus. Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle. Last year, India was rocked by protests against a controversial new law that offered citizenship to non-Muslims from three nearby countries. The BJP government says it will protect minorities from those countries from persecution. Many Muslims also fear they could be made stateless, following an announcement that the government plans to weed out \"infiltrators\" from neighbouring countries among India's population, if they cannot provide extensive documentation to prove their ancestors lived in India Mr Modi has said the law \"will have no effect on citizens of India, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Christians and Buddhists\".",

    "text": "Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government believed Sunday's attacks could not have been carried out without help from terror groups abroad. IS claimed the attack on Tuesday, although did not provide evidence. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's president vowed to \"completely restructure\" state security after the attacks. In a televised address late on Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said he plans to change the heads of defence forces \"within the next 24 hours\". He also admitted threat reports had not been shared with him, and promised to take \"stern action\" against security officials. What did the prime minister say? Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks \"could not have been done just locally\". \"There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier,\" he said. Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack, all of whom were Sri Lankan nationals. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. ''We, certainly the security apparatus, are of the view there are foreign links and some of the evidence points to that. So if the IS (Islamic State) claimed it, we will be following up on this claim,\" he added. The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be \"out there\" following the attack. Who could be behind the attacks? IS said it had \"targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka\" via its Amaq news outlet. It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. He also said \"preliminary investigations\" indicated that the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. 'Targets in line with IS ideology' Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The Sri Lankan government has said locals from two known groups carried out the attack. But from the start - because of the scale and sophistication of it - they have also said they thought there was an external role. In the past, IS has sometimes claimed attacks that it was not involved in or which it simply inspired. But the details from IS would seem to back up the government's assessment. The choice of targets is much more in line with IS ideology than with the traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka. There are still questions - did the local men affiliate themselves to IS or receive direct support? Did they travel to Syria or to other countries? The Sri Lankan government has said it believes some of them had spent time abroad, but how significant was that to the plot? Answering questions like these will be important not just for Sri Lanka but other countries as they try and understand whether other relatively small, locally focused groups could be capable of transforming a threat into violence on such a massive scale. Who were the victims? The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 10 Indian nationals. The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect. Are you in Sri Lanka? Have you been affected by the attacks?

    "text": "By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all? Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been \"almost zero progress\" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries. A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were \"staggering\", with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing. While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out. And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education. Conflict zones Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls. These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict. Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school. And many marry young, ending any chance of an education. UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones. The rankings are based on: For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included. Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education: A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries. Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept. The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school. And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya and learned to read at the age of 60.

    "text": "By Alessia CerantolaBBC World Service Ten-year-old Yuta Ito waited until the annual Golden Week holiday last spring to tell his parents how he was feeling - on a family day out he confessed that he no longer wanted to go to school. For months he had been attending his primary school with great reluctance, often refusing to go at all. He was being bullied and kept fighting with his classmates. His parents then had three choices: get Yuta to attend school counselling in the hope things would improve, home-school him, or send him to a free school. They chose the last option. Now Yuta spends his school days doing whatever he wants - and he's much happier. Yuta is one of Japan's many futoko, defined by Japan's education ministry as children who don't go to school for more than 30 days, for reasons unrelated to health or finances. The term has been variously translated as absenteeism, truancy, school phobia or school refusal. Attitudes to futoko have changed over the decades. Until 1992 school refusal - then called tokokyohi, meaning resistance - was considered a type of mental illness. But in 1997 the terminology changed to the more neutral futoko, meaning non-attendance. On 17 October, the government announced that absenteeism among elementary and junior high school students had hit a record high, with 164,528 children absent for 30 days or more during 2018, up from 144,031 in 2017. The free school movement started in Japan in the 1980s, in response to the growing number of futoko. They're alternative schools that operate on principles of freedom and individuality. They're an accepted alternative to compulsory education, along with home-schooling, but won't give children a recognised qualification. The number of students attending free or alternative schools instead of regular schools has shot up over the years, from 7,424 in 1992 to 20,346 in 2017. Dropping out of school can have long-term consequences, and there is a high risk that young people can withdraw from society entirely and shut themselves away in their rooms - a phenomenon known as hikikomori. More worrying still is the number of pupils who take their own lives. In 2018, the number of school suicides was the highest in 30 years, with 332 cases. In 2016 the rising number of student suicides led the Japanese government to pass a suicide prevention act with special recommendations for schools. So why are so many children avoiding school in Japan? Family circumstances, personal issues with friends, and bullying are among the main causes, according to a survey by the ministry of education. In general, the dropouts reported that they didn't get along with other students, or sometimes with the teachers. That was also the case for Tomoe Morihashi. \"I didn't feel comfortable with many people,\" says the 12-year-old. \"School life was painful.\" Tomoe suffered from selective mutism, which affected her whenever she was out in public. \"I couldn't speak outside my home or away from my family,\" she says. And she found it hard to obey the rigid set of rules that govern Japanese schools. \"Tights must not be coloured, hair must not be dyed, the colour of hair elastics is fixed, and they must not be worn on the wrist,\" she says. Many schools in Japan control every aspect of their pupils' appearance, forcing pupils to dye their brown hair black, or not allowing pupils to wear tights or coats, even in cold weather. In some cases they even decide on the colour of pupils' underwear. Strict school rules were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s in response to violence and bullying. They relaxed in the 1990s but have become more severe recently. These regulations are known as \"black school rules\", reflecting a popular term used to describe companies that exploit their workers. Now Tomoe, like Yuta, attends Tamagawa Free School in Tokyo where students don't need to wear a uniform and are free to choose their own activities, according to a plan agreed between the school, parents and pupils. They are encouraged to follow their individual skills and interests. There are rooms with computers for Japanese and maths classes and a library with books and mangas (Japanese comic books). The atmosphere is very informal, like a big family. Students meet in common spaces to chat and play together. \"The purpose of this school is to develop people's social skills,\" says Takashi Yoshikawa, the head of the school. Whether it's through exercising, playing games or studying, the important thing is to learn not to panic when they're in a large group. The school recently moved to a larger space, and about 10 children attend every day. Mr Yoshikawa opened his first free school in 2010, in a three-storey apartment in Tokyo's residential neighbourhood of Fuchu. \"I expected students over 15 years old, but actually those who came were only seven or eight years old,\" he says. \"Most were silent with selective mutism, and at school they didn't do anything.\" Mr Yoshikawa believes that communication problems are at the root of most students' school refusal. His own journey into education was unusual. He quit his job as a \"salary man\" in a Japanese company in his early 40s, when he decided he wasn't interested in climbing the career ladder. His father was a doctor, and like him, he wanted to serve his community, so he became a social worker and foster father. The experience opened his eyes to the problems children face. He realised how many students suffered because they were poor, or victims of domestic abuse, and how much this affected their performance at school. Part of the challenge pupils face is the big class sizes, says Prof Ryo Uchida, an education expert at Nagoya University. \"In classrooms with about 40 students who have to spend a year together, many things can happen,\" he says. Prof Uchida says comradeship is the key ingredient to surviving life in Japan because the population density is so high - if you don't get along and co-ordinate with others, you won't survive. This not only applies to schools, but also to public transport and other public spaces, all of which are overcrowded. But for many students this need to conform is a problem. They don't feel comfortable in overcrowded classrooms where they have to do everything together with their classmates in a small space. \"Feeling uncomfortable in such a situation is normal,\" says Prof Uchida. What's more, in Japan, children stay in the same class from year to year, so if problems occur, going to school can become painful. \"In that sense, the support provided for example by free schools is very meaningful,\" Prof Uchida says. \"In free schools, they care less about the group and they tend to value the thoughts and feelings of each single student.\" But although free schools are providing an alternative, the problems within the education system itself remain an issue. For Prof Uchida, not developing students' diversity is a violation of their human rights - and many agree. Criticism of \"black school rules\" and the Japanese school environment is increasing nationwide. In a recent column the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper described them as a violation of human rights and an obstacle to student diversity. In August, the campaign group \"Black kosoku o nakuso! Project\" [Let's get rid of black school rules!] submitted an online petition to the education ministry signed by more than 60,000 people, asking for an investigation into unreasonable school rules. Osaka Prefecture ordered all of its high schools to review their rules, with about 40% of schools making changes. Prof Uchida says the education ministry now appears to accept absenteeism not as an anomaly, but a trend. He sees this as a tacit admission that futoko children are not the problem but that they are reacting to an education system that is failing to provide a welcoming environment.

    "text": "A two-judge bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court awarded bail to three law students from the elite Jindal Global Law School who had been convicted by a lower court in March for blackmailing and gang-raping a fellow student. Hardik Sikri and Karan Chhabra were sentenced to 20 years in prison, while their friend Vikas Garg was handed a seven-year term. They were all also found guilty of other crimes and given smaller terms, but these were to run concurrently. According to court documents, the young woman had a consensual relationship with Sikri in November 2013 which lasted a month, after which she broke up with him. But for the next 18 months, he used her nude photographs to blackmail her and rape her. Not just that, he also forced her to have sex with his two friends and on one occasion, Sikri and Chhabra gang-raped her. The convicts appealed in the high court and asked to be freed on bail while the case was being heard - and the court agreed. In a country where thousands of people under trial languish in prison for decades, often for minor crimes, it is shocking that men convicted of crimes as serious as gang-rape and blackmail were freed on bail. What is worse is that the short 12-page court order is littered with statements that have been described by the Indian media as some of the \"worst examples of victim shaming\". The young woman was castigated for drinking beer, smoking, taking drugs, keeping condoms in her room and not confiding in her parents that she was being abused. Here are some excerpts from the judgement: Read the full court order In their order, Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Raj Shekhar Attri said they intended \"to balance the concerns of the victim, demands of the society and law and the element of reformatory and rehabilitative justice\". \"It would be a travesty if these young minds are confined to jail for an inordinate long period which would deprive them of their education, opportunity to redeem themselves and be a part of the society as normal beings,\" they added. Predictably, the court order has been greeted with howls of protest in India. Many took to social media to express their anger and the victim's friends started a petition on change.org condemning the judgement. Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy told the BBC that the order \"implies she had no right not to be raped\". A judgement like this, she says, takes away hard-won victories for women's legal equality. \"This order seems to be innocent of the legal definition of consent and of the judgements of the Supreme Court that are quite clear that even a woman of 'easy virtue' may well withhold consent. Any sex after that is rape,\" Ms Nundy says. In a society steeped in patriarchy, it's not uncommon for women to be blamed for inviting sexual assault and rape. Victims are often blamed for wearing short skirts or jeans, having boyfriends, being out late at night, or even talking on mobile phones. In fact, until 2003, we even had a law that allowed victim shaming. Under Section 155(4) of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, it was essentially the rape victims who were put on trial and the accused were often allowed to go scot-free if they could prove that \"the victim was of generally immoral character\". In 1980, the Law Commission suggested that the archaic law be amended and in 2000, the Commission recommended its deletion, saying that it could destroy a victim's reputation and self-respect. Decades later, however, victims continue to be shamed.",

    "text": "There's one particular day - soon after I turned 11 - that I can't forget. I was at my grandparents' house and for the first time I'd been allowed to go out with a cousin and her friend, without any adults - three girls on our own, out on our first adventure. \"Be careful. Don't go too far and don't spend your money on stupid things,\" my grandma warned us. She meant ice cream - and yes, we were planning to spend our money on that. I was excited, but nervous. This needed to go well if I was to stand a chance of ever going out on my own! \"OK Shaimaa,\" I remember thinking. \"No falling, no fighting, no losing your money.\" I should have added: \"No getting sexually harassed by teenage boys.\" But how could I know? In the busy summer streets of Alexandria, we hadn't realised we were being followed. But three boys walking behind started bumping into us. Then one of them groped me. All I could do to escape our tormentors was walk ahead as fast as I could, with my cousin and her friend trying to catch up. But they kept following us. The three of us held hands and rushed back toward my grandparents' house. The boys were right behind. Now verbally harassing us. I was frightened, but also angry. These boys had ruined my big day. I turned around and yelled: \"Kifaya! Enough!\" \"Kifaya!\" one of them echoed, mocking me. Later on, my mother chastised me. \"You talked to them?\" she fumed. \"You don't talk to someone who's harassing you … you just keep going. That's what they want - if you engage and make a scene, they win.\" My grandma chimed in. \"Were you loud? Were you laughing and being silly for no reason? I know how you can get, Shaimaa.\" I tried to remember if I'd laughed. I probably had. I was having fun - until I got sexually harassed. \"And why that sleeveless shirt? It's too short, your whole bottom is showing,\" she went on. I had no idea how the conversation turned from me complaining about three horrible boys and what they did to me, to my being blamed for their actions. Find out more It was the first time I was sexually harassed but of course not the last. Some later incidents were much worse. But that day had a lasting effect. It informed the way I felt about walking the streets of Egypt and how I behaved in them. All my life I wanted the freedom to do things on my own, and here I was, confronted with the reality for Egyptian women - that with the freedom to be in the streets came harassment. My mother laid down some rules: 1. It will happen. It's normal. 2. Don't smile. Frown preferably. 3. Walk fast. Don't linger. 4. Wear long shirts that cover your behind. 5. Do not bring attention to yourself in any way. In the years to come, these rules would sometimes work, but often wouldn't. Sexual harassment would become a part of mine and my friends' lives. Our experiences varied from verbal harassment, to inappropriate touching, to groping, to having men try to rip our clothes off. The culprits were everyone from random men on the streets - shopkeepers, doormen- to teachers, co-workers and relatives. But we wouldn't dream of speaking up. As with all Egyptian women, we had to balance harassment on the streets against more restrictions at home. In 2013 a UN report said that 99% of the women it surveyed in Egypt had been sexually harassed. \"We don't need a report,\" one of my friends laughed at the time. \"Just come and live with us for a bit!\" A recent poll suggests that Cairo is the world's most dangerous megacity for women, but I can attest that my city also lives up to this scandalous reputation. Things have moved on quite a bit since I was 11. Young women are now much more vocal. There have been campaigns against sexual harassment and law enforcement takes it more seriously. Yet all of this hasn't stopped the harassers. I don't live in Egypt now, but when I visit I can feel myself tense up. I still have my invisible armour - those rules my mum set out. I'm always on guard when I'm alone in the streets. I have an eight-year-old niece who reminds me so much of myself when I was her age. Soon enough she'll want to venture out on her own. And here's what I'll probably tell her: \"Don't laugh, don't linger, and if something happens, call someone and get back home.\" But here's what I really want to tell her: \"You look beautiful. Laugh, have fun, enjoy yourself - and if some horrible person harasses you, shout, make a scene and defend yourself! And always, always remember: it is not your fault!\" More from Shaimaa Khalil: Why I took off my headscarf... only to put it back on again Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.",

    "text": "By Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter At a sensitive time in life, their brain development, behaviour and mental health could suffer. Using social media might make up for some negative effects of social distancing, they write in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health. But they call for schools to reopen for young people as a priority when safe. Adolescence - defined by the scientists as between 10 and 24 - is a vulnerable stage, when young people want to spend more time with their friends than their family, as they prepare for adult life. Combined with major hormonal and biological changes, it's a key time for the development of the brain. It's also the period in life when mental-health problems are mostly likely to develop. But the arrival of coronavirus has disrupted all that, says Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, from the department of psychology at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the opinion piece. \"Owing to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, many young people around the world currently have substantially fewer opportunities to interact face-to-face with peers in their social network at a time in their lives when this is crucial for their development,\" she says. \"Even if physical distancing measures are temporary, several months represents a large proportion of a young person's life. \"We would urge policymakers to give urgent consideration to the well-being of young people at this time.\" The Viewpoint article, written with Amy Orben, research fellow at Cambridge, and Livia Tomova, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls for more research to be carried out to understand the effects of \"social deprivation\" on adolescents. At present, research on animals is all they have to go on - and it suggests that non-human primates and rodents experience a rise in anxious behaviour and a decrease in brain functions related to learning and memory when social contact is taken away. This is likely to be due to the lack of experiences for social learning, they say. Social-media impact But with 69% of younger adolescents in the UK, aged 12-15, having a social-media profile, social connection is still possible - via anything from Instagram to online gaming. The question is how much and what kinds of digital communication help to lessen the effects of physical distancing, says Dr Orben. \"Some studies have shown that active social-media use, such as messaging or posting directly on another person's profile, increases well-being and helps maintain personal relationships. \"However, it has been suggested that passive uses of social media, such as scrolling through newsfeeds, negatively influence wellbeing.\" Lockdown rules brought in to stop the spread of the virus have meant schools in the UK have been closed to most children since 20 March. A small number of primary school children have returned in England, but only in small groups.",

    "text": "The border agency says the boy died on Monday night hours after showing signs of illness. A Texas congressman named him as Felipe Alónzo-Gomez. The child was detained with his father on 18 December after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border. A seven-year-old girl died earlier this month just hours after being detained. Jakelin Caal, also from Guatemala, developed a high fever and died of liver failure. Her funeral was held in her village on Tuesday. Thousands of migrants have travelled from Central America - mainly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - to the US border. Many say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries and plan to seek asylum in the US. What do we know about the latest case? In a new, lengthy statement, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said the boy, whose identity has not been officially confirmed, died at 23:48 local time (06:48 GMT) on 24 December. The cause of death is still unknown. After being detained in El Paso, Texas, he and his father were taken to a local processing centre, where they spent two days. They were then sent to El Paso Border Patrol Station, where they were held for another two days. On 22 December, they were transferred to Alamogordo Border Patrol Station, in neighbouring New Mexico. On Monday morning, an agent noticed that the boy \"was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes\". He was taken with his father to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol (paracetamol). While being evaluated for release, he was found to have a fever of 103F (39.4C) and held for more observation. He was released shortly afterwards with a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen. The boy and his father were taken to a temporary site at the Highway 70 checkpoint, where the child received the medication. Two hours later, he vomited. His father declined further medical assistance, the CBP said, as the child had been feeling better. The child appeared lethargic at around 22:00, when he was sent back to the hospital. While being transported, the boy vomited and lost consciousness, and doctors at the hospital were unable to revive him. The CBP earlier said the boy died just after midnight. It did not explain why they were held for so long. His father remains in custody. The Associated Press news agency reported they had plans to go to Johnson City, Tennessee. What has the reaction been? CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the death was \"tragic\" and announced that the agency would conduct further medical checks on all children in custody, with a focus on those under the age of 10. He also said the CBP would review its policies and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to improve custody conditions. Human rights groups criticised the CBP and Guatemala's foreign ministry called for an investigation. Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a congressional investigation, saying the administration's policy of turning people away at the border \"is putting families and children in great danger\". What is happening at the border? The Trump administration has tried to deter asylum seekers from crossing the border irregularly between ports of entry, warning that they could face arrest, prosecution and deportation. But, at the same time, it is restricting access to those trying to cross through official ports of entry, creating a long wait for applicants. Among them are thousands of Central American migrants who travelled together in so-called \"caravans\", and arrived at the border with California in recent weeks. President Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases.",

    "text": "By Nazima PathanScience fellow, BBC News The researchers said childhood passive smoking was \"likely to add seven deaths to every 100,000 non-smoking adults dying annually\". The study of 70,900 non-smoking men and women was led by the American Cancer Society. Experts said the best way to protect children was to quit smoking. If participants lived with a smoker during adulthood, there were other health implications, the study found. Smoke exposure of 10 or more hours every week increased their risk of death from ischemic heart disease by 27%, stroke by 23% and chronic obstructive lung disease by 42% compared to those who lived with non-smokers. The study was published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Participants were questioned about their exposure to smoking throughout their lives, and then their health was tracked over the next 22 years. 'Smoke outside' Hazel Cheeseman, of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health, said: \"This latest study adds to the compelling case to take smoke outside to protect children from harm. \"The best way to do this is for parents to quit.\" She referred to data on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England urging improved funding in this area. Dr Nick Hopkinson, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, agreed, saying: \"Passive smoking has a lasting impact well beyond childhood. \"Unfortunately, stop smoking services in the UK are being cut. We need to make sure that everyone, especially parents of young children and pregnant women who smoke, get the help they need to quit.\" Lifelong risks Children whose parents smoke are known to be at risk of asthma and poor lung development. This study shows that the effects of childhood smoke exposure persist into adulthood, resulting in chronic obstructive lung disease. While the researchers focused on mortality risks, they emphasised that childhood second-hand smoking may also increase chronic illness and healthcare dependency in later life. Dr Ryan Diver, one of the report's authors, said: \"This is the first study to identify an association between childhood exposure to second-hand smoke and death from chronic obstructive lung disease in middle age and beyond. \"Our findings provide further evidence for reducing second-hand smoke exposure throughout life,\" he added.",

    "text": "By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Pupils will not be allowed to bring mobiles to school without written parental consent. The authorities say they want to protect young people's eyesight, improve their concentration and prevent internet addiction. Schools are being encouraged to find other ways for parents to communicate with children during the school day. According to one of the country's newspapers, China Daily, there has been heated debate among parents over the whether the ruling is practical. The vast majority of children and teenagers in China access the internet via their own smartphones - 74% of under-18s, according to the government-affiliated China Internet Network Information Centre. But the authorities are concerned about how internet use is affecting the health of the nation's youth. There have been rising levels of nearsightedness among children in China and in 2018, the authorities announced plans to regulate the gaming industry which was partially blamed for the problem. They also cited concerns that gaming addiction was damaging mental health. The following year a curfew was imposed on under-18s, who were restricted to 90 minutes of gaming on weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays. French ban Many schools in China already restrict the use of mobile phones on their premises. In some extreme cases, phones have been smashed in front of students who have broken the rules. The topic of a ban has become a major news item in China and on social media, with thousands discussing it on social media site Weibo. Some 27,000 people voted in an online Sina News poll, with most saying there was no need for the new rules because of the widespread ban during school hours. Some pointed out that children may continue to over-use their phones when not in school. A plan to stop schools setting homework tasks via phone has also been criticised. One teacher told state broadcaster CCTV that \"not allowing phones to contact someone, or to arrange homework, that will take some getting used to. They all get so much homework, so that's been convenient.\" French lawmakers voted in 2018 to ban the use of phones in primary and middle schools, ruling that children under 15 have to keep their mobile phones out of sight while on school premises. A survey conducted in the UK by price comparison site uSwitch last year suggested that just under half of UK parents thought their child's school should ban mobile phones. The use of phones in the UK is generally left up to individual schools. One head teacher, from Anglesey in Wales, told the BBC that teachers could find themselves spending too much time challenging children for using phones, which took time away from actually teaching them.",

    "text": "They were left off a list of proven citizens, which was created as part of a government drive to identify illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Here's what led to that controversial move, and what might happen next. How did the list come about? Fears over illegal migration from Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, have long been alive in Assam. The state's very first list of citizens - formally known as the National Register of Citizens, or NRC - was published in 1951, just four years after the partition of India, when millions of people had crossed into India from East Bengal, which had become a part of Pakistan. The list was drawn up in response to nationalist groups in Assam who were afraid of an influx of Muslim immigrants changing the state's Hindu-majority demographics. But the problem re-emerged in the 1970s. After Bangladesh declared independence and broke away from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, sparking a bitter war, millions again fled to neighbouring India. And many of the refugees settled in Assam. By 1979, a movement against illegal immigrants led by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) took hold. The agitation turned violent in 1983 when mobs killed more than 2,000 suspected immigrants, most of whom were Muslims. AASU and some other regional groups eventually signed an agreement in 1985 with the federal government led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It said that anyone who could not prove that they were living in Assam by 24 March 1971 would be expelled from electoral rolls and considered illegal immigrants. But the accord was never implemented. So why is it being updated after all these years? In 2009, a man named Aabhijeet Sharma petitioned the Supreme Court, asking that the NRC be updated. In 2014, the court instructed the federal government to do so by 31 January 2016. However given the magnitude of the exercise - which involved the verification of documents belonging to more than 32 million people - the first draft of the NRC was only published in December 2017. The second draft was published on 30 July. Who is on the list? The NRC contains the names of people who have been able to prove that they arrived in Assam on or before 24 March 1971. Everyone in the state had to submit documents to prove their claim to citizenship, including land and tenancy records, voter IDs or passports. Those who were born after 1971 were asked to submit documents that proved that their parents or grandparents had settled in India before the cut-off date. Around four million people did not make the list. Their names could be deleted from electoral rolls as they are not considered legitimate citizens. What has the reaction been? It has been mixed. Many Hindus across the country have hailed it as a bold move and praised the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for implementing it when other state governments did not have the \"guts\" to do so. Some feel that it is a political masterstroke ahead of upcoming national elections in 2019. But opposition parties have roundly denounced the move and criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for separating families and effectively making millions of people stateless overnight. Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the list had created \"massive insecurity\" among people. And Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of neighbouring West Bengal state, has been its most vocal critic. She predicted a \"bloodbath\" and said the exercise was making a mockery of democracy. \"It seems like the BJP is using the issue to polarise voters and reinforce its anti-Muslim rhetoric - and opposition parties have reacted to the bait,\" Subir Bhaumik, author of Troubled Periphery, a study of India's troubled north-east, told the BBC. But Indian officials have insisted that the process is \"not targeting Muslims\". Prateek Hajela, the NRC head, told BBC Urdu that those excluded were \"people from different religions and groups\". Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the upper house of parliament that the process was \"fair and transparent\" and that \"no Indian citizen would be left out\". Is this a final list? No. The government has been very categorical about this. Home Minister Singh has made it clear that people can appeal against their non-inclusion. They can also submit more documents to claim citizenship in the coming months. So there is a chance that an updated list will carry their names. And activists say is a necessary move. The NRC has already produced some surprising results - former servicemen, current political leaders and even some government employees, including one tasked with compiling the NRC - have not found their names on the list. News reports have pointed out how minor spelling errors have led to documents being rejected. Others mention how some families have seen one sibling making it on to the list while another did not. Assam also has a history of flooding, which means that many families have often lost official documents along with other belongings. Will there be mass deportations? It is unclear - but also unlikely at the moment, say experts. Mr Modi has consistently said that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But the BBC's India columnist, Soutik Biswas, says Bangladesh will \"definitely not accede to such a request\". Instead, he adds, there is a chance that India will end up \"creating the newest cohort of stateless people\" - similar to the Rohingyas of Myanmar. There are currently half a dozen detention camps in Assam, which house some 1,000 people. In July, the state government said it had permission to build a new detention centre for those unable to prove their citizenship, the Indian Express reports. India has no official treaty with Bangladesh in relation to the NRC or cross-border illegal immigration. Regional security expert Seshadri Chari says that Bangladesh has always maintained that the NRC is an \"internal matter and not a bilateral issue between the two countries\". He adds: \"This underscores Bangladesh's resolve to not accept even one single illegal migrant that India may want to deport.\" Are there fears of violence? There has been concern over the safety of those whose names are not on the list. While the government has not released any data on their religious identities, the majority of them are believed to be Bengali-speaking Muslims. But there have been no protests or incidents of violence so far. \"Who is going to protest? Those in Assam who have pushed for it are feeling vindicated right now,\" Mr Bhaumik says. \"And those whose names are not on the list are preoccupied with trying to get on it.\" A final list which is to be compiled after addressing all appeals and challenges could trigger violence, says the BBC's Nitin Srivastava, who has been reporting on the NRC in Assam. \"That is when they will be concerned about losing their land, voting rights and freedom.\" Reporting by Krutika Pathi",

He added that the cars had the ability to \"improve people's lives by transforming mobility\". But some researchers working in this field are investigating potential downsides to driverless car technology. They believe they could make traffic and urban sprawl worse, as people accept longer commutes as they do not have to drive themselves. Flexible windscreen The BBC was given access to the Google team to talk about the secret project, and see early renderings of the car. It looks almost cartoon-like, it has no traditional bonnet at the front, and the wheels are pushed to the corners. It will seat two people, propulsion will be electric, and at the start it will be limited to 25mph (40km/h) to help ensure safety. The most significant thing about the design is that it does not have any controls, apart from a stop/go button. For early testing, extra controls will be fitted so one of Google's test drivers can take over if there is a problem. The controls will simply plug in, and Mr Urmson believes that over time, as confidence in the technology grows, they will be removed entirely. The front end of the vehicle is designed to be safer for pedestrians, with a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be, and a more flexible windscreen, which may help reduce injuries. The vehicle will use a combination of laser and radar sensors along with camera data to drive autonomously. It will depend on Google's road maps, built specifically for the programme, and tested on the company's current fleet of vehicles. Ready in a year Google recently announced that its self driving cars had covered 700,000 miles of public roads in autonomous mode, and that they were now tackling the tricky problem of busy city streets. The company plans to build a fleet of around 200 of the cars in Detroit, with the hope of using them as an autonomous technology test bed. \"We'll see these vehicles on the road within the year,\" says Mr Urmson. Advocates claim that autonomous cars have the potential to revolutionise transport, by making roads safer, eliminating crashes, and decreasing congestion and pollution. In the year to June 2013, more than 23,500 people were killed or seriously injured in road traffic accidents in the UK, according to government figures. Ron Medford, previously the deputy director of the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and now the safety director for the self-driving car team at Google, believes that number could be drastically reduced by removing the chance of driver error. \"I think it has the potential to be the most important safety technology that the auto industry has ever seen,\" he said. But Sven Beiker, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, cautions that driverless cars may still require human input in extreme circumstances and that people may forget how to operate their vehicles if they do not do it regularly. This could be particularly dangerous in an emergency situation where the computer does not know how to react, and asks for input from a human who may not have been paying attention, he warned. \"You will not be able to fiddle around looking for the instruction manual in the glove box that you've never looked at before,\" he said. He equates it to people who drive automatics forgetting how to easily drive a car with a manual gearbox. Listeners in the UK can hear more on the potential of driverless cars on Frontiers on BBC Radio 4 on Wed 4 June.",

    "text": "By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor A revamped design with an edge-to-edge display, facial recognition ID system and advanced augmented reality features is expected. Several analysts have predicted the asking price for the top-end models will hit new heights too. In a world in which the smartphone has become ubiquitous, it's easy to forget how much of a surprise Steve Jobs's unveiling of the original was a decade ago, and how divided opinion was about whether it was truly a game-changer. To mark the occasion, we have picked 10 key moments from its past. 1. 2004: The birth of Project Purple After the success of first the iMac and then the iPod, Apple began developing a tablet as its next breakthrough product. But around 2004, ex-iOS chief Scott Forstall recalls having a critical conversation over lunch with chief executive Steve Jobs. \"We were both using our phones and hated them,\" he told an audience earlier this year. \"We looked around, and like everyone around us has a phone, and everyone looks very angsty as they're using them. \"And Steve said, 'Do you think we can take that demo we are doing with the tablet and multi-touch and shrink it down to something… small enough to fit in your pocket?'\" This prompted Apple's engineers to create a basic contacts app that was constrained to a corner of the prototype tablet's display. \"The second [Steve Jobs] saw this demo, he knew this was it,\" Mr Forstall said. \"There was no question. This was the way a phone had to behave.\" As a legal filing would later reveal, by August 2005 Apple's industrial designers had already created a concept form factor - codenamed Purple - that is recognisable as the basis for the iPhone that followed. 2. July 2008: First iOS App Store apps released There are now well over two million native apps available for the iPhone's iOS operating system, and most owners have several pages and folders worth of the programs. But for a while, after the first iPhone launched, there weren't enough to fill even a single screen. That's because third-party developers were initially limited to creating software that ran within the device's web browser. Steve Jobs reportedly believed policing a native app marketplace would be too complicated. It wasn't until more than a year after the handset went on sale that the App Store was launched. And history was made on 9 July when Apple made a handful of native apps live in advance of the marketplace opening its virtual doors. Among them was Moo - a cow sound simulator - from Denver-based developer Erica Sadun. \"I had come from the jailbreak community [in which developers modify smartphones to add capabilities], which put a lot of pressure on Apple to have its own store,\" Ms Sadun said. \"The App Store completely revolutionised how independent developers could create businesses, monetise their product and present it to a community of people that was larger than anybody had ever dreamed of. \"It created a gold rush that I don't think we are ever going to see again.\" 3. September 2008: HTC Dream unveiled It sounds fanciful now, but once upon a time Google's chief executive was a member of Apple's board of directors. Eric Schmidt did not resign from the post until 2009, but his days were numbered as soon as the first commercial Android phone was announced. The HTC Dream offered features the iPhone still lacked, including copy and paste, Street View and multimedia messaging. And while reviews were tepid - suggesting it was \"best suited for early adopters\" - they recognised the potential of a more open smartphone platform to iOS. Curiously, the Dream was theoretically capable of supporting \"multi-touch\" gestures - recognising how many fingers were in contact with the screen - but the feature was disabled. That was probably because Apple had patented the technology. When HTC added the feature to a follow-up handset in 2010, Steve Jobs was infuriated. \"I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product,\" he subsequently told his biographer Walter Isaacson. \"I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.\" 4. February 2010: Siri app released by SRI These days, Apple spends millions making adverts starring Siri and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, among other celebrity co-stars. But when the virtual assistant was first released on iOS, it was a relatively low-profile app from a fairly obscure Californian research institute, which had been part-funded by the Pentagon. Its business model was to charge restaurants and event promoters a fee for any voice-controlled bookings made for their businesses, and the plan was to release follow-up versions for Android and Blackberry. But that changed two months after its launch, when Apple bought the technology, reportedly for more than $200m (£150m). The app remained live on the App Store until October 2011, at which point an upgraded version became an exclusive feature for the newly launched iPhone 4S. 5. June 2010: The first selfie iPhone When the iPhone 4 was released, reviews highlighting its addition of a front camera focused on its use for video calls rather than self-portraits. Perhaps that was understandable. Although the word \"selfie\" had already been coined, it had yet to become commonplace. And while the iPhone 4 was not the first handset to feature a camera on both its sides - Sony Ericsson did so in 2003 - it can claim to have been a driving force in the rise of selfie culture. \"The iPhone 4 was important as you had a device that was very easy to use, a big teen demographic with access to it, and an explosion of mobile apps,\" said Charles Arthur, author of Digital Wars. \"It's a classic example of unintended consequences. \"Now, the selfie has taken over from the autograph. \"Watch people at any public event where they are meeting stars, and they're always trying to get a selfie with them.\" 6. October 2011: The death of Steve Jobs When Tim Cook - rather than Steve Jobs - unveiled the 4S on 4 October 2011, he faced criticism for his performance. The BBC even accused him of appearing \"dull\". What wasn't apparent at the time was that Mr Cook must have been aware that his mentor and friend Steve Jobs was close to death. He died the next day. It is likely that Apple would have collapsed had Mr Jobs not returned in 1997 to the company he had co-founded, meaning there would never have been an iPhone. Or had he not subsequently stayed at Apple, it's possible the company's engineers might have pursued a rival mobile phone design based around the iPod's click wheel. Certainly, since his death, Apple has yet to launch a product that has come anywhere close to achieving the iPhone's level of success, and some question whether it ever will. Mr Jobs's last public appearance was at Cupertino City Council in June 2011, where he sought permission for Apple to build a new headquarters. The new iPhone will be the first product to be launched at the new campus, within an event space called the Steve Jobs Theater. 7. April 2012: Facebook's $1bn takeover of Instagram If ever proof were needed of the disruptive economic impact of the iPhone, the takeover of Instagram provided it. The app had been in existence only 18 months when the deal was announced. It had just 13 employees and had been an iOS-exclusive until the week before the revelation. Its takeover provided a bonanza to both Instagram's investors as well as to other smartphone-related start-ups seeking venture capital cash. At the time, many thought Facebook had wildly overpaid. Now, as Instagram sucks in ever more advertising dollars while offline media's funding struggles worsen, it seems like a bargain. Other apps that debuted on the iPhone - including Uber, Deliveroo and Airbnb - have shaken up industry in other ways. And by one estimate, the total value of the global app economy - including software sales, advertising and mobile commerce - was $1.3tn (£993bn) for last year. 8. July 2012: Apple buys AuthenTec Apple's $356m takeover of a fingerprint sensor chip-maker in 2012 caused a particular problem for Samsung. The South Korean company was already using the Florida-based company's components in its laptops and had just announced a deal to add another of its security products to its Android phones. But while the idea of frustrating its arch-rival probably had some appeal, the biggest benefit to Apple was the ability to launch its Touch ID system in 2013's iPhone 5S. As reviews noted, previous attempts to introduce fingerprint scanning to phones had proven \"unreliable, often causing more aggravation than they're worth\" but the new system worked \"pretty much flawlessly\". Initially, the feature was limited to being used to unlock the phone and make digital purchases from Apple. But it later made it possible for the company to introduce Apple Pay and add security to third-party apps without requiring the hassle of typing in a password each time. One side-effect of the sensor's success is it may have prolonged the life of a physical home button on the iPhone. If rumours are to be believed, Apple has struggled to replace it with a part that could be hidden beneath the screen and may be about to replace it altogether with facial recognition scans on the iPhone X. 9. August 2013: Steve Ballmer says he is stepping down as Microsoft chief In 1997, Microsoft threw Apple a lifeline by taking a $150m stake in the failing company. Apple returned the favour by launching a product that Microsoft first failed to properly understand and then struggled to match. Chief executive Steve Ballmer famously laughed at the iPhone's prospects after he first heard about it. \"That is the most expensive phone in the world, and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard,\" he said in 2007. Six years later, he announced the takeover of Nokia's phone business for 5.4bn euros ($6.5bn; £5bn) in an attempt to catch up, only for the sum to be written off in 2015 after he had departed and his successor finally accepted Windows Phone was a flop. The irony is that if Microsoft's stake in Apple had not been sold off under Mr Ballmer, it would now be worth more than $40bn and he might have shared in its success. \"Like so many other people, Steve Ballmer completely underestimated the impact of the iPhone,\" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. \"His arrogant dismissal has certainly come back to haunt him.\" 10. July 2016: Pokemon Go released Pokemon Go fever is now well past its peak, and the app more likely to make headlines for botched events than rare monster sightings. But its legacy has been to prove that augmented reality (AR) apps - in which graphics are mixed with real-world views - can have mass appeal. AR actually dates back to 2009 on the iPhone, when a French developer created an app that shows nearby shops and other points of interest in Paris. But it's set to come of age with the imminent release of iOS 11, which includes ARKit - software that makes it easier for developers to anchor graphics to the world beyond and take account of its lighting conditions. Several demos released in advance have looked impressive, not least a version of PacMan where you walk through the maze. The question remains whether users will be satisfied experiencing the action on their iPhones, or whether Apple will feel compelled to release an accompanying headset to let them go hands-free.",

    "text": "Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter The files reveal how pigeons were trained for clandestine missions photographing sensitive sites inside the Soviet Union. The release also reveals how ravens were used to drop bugging devices on window sills and dolphins were trained for underwater missions. The CIA believed animals could fulfil \"unique\" tasks for the agency's clandestine operations. Inside the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is a museum, sadly closed to the general public. During a visit to interview the then-director I caught sight of something unusual amid all the bugging devices and spy gadgets. It was a model pigeon with a camera strapped to it. My interest was heightened by the fact that I was writing a book about British spy pigeons during World War Two. But I was told - repeatedly - that details of CIA spy pigeon missions were still classified. That was until now. The 1970s' operation was codenamed Tacana and explored the use of pigeons with tiny cameras to automatically take photos, newly released files show. It took advantage of the fact that the humble pigeon is possessed of an amazing ability - almost a superpower. They can be dropped somewhere they have never been before and still find their way hundreds of miles back home. The use of pigeons for communications dates back thousands of years but it was in World War One that they began to be used for intelligence gathering. In World War Two a little known branch of British intelligence - MI14(d) - ran a Secret Pigeon Service which dropped birds in a container with a parachute over Occupied Europe. A questionnaire was attached. More than 1,000 pigeons returned with messages including details of V1 rocket launch sites and German radar stations. One message from a resistance group called Leopold Vindictive produced a 12-page intelligence report sent directly to Churchill. After the war, a special \"Pigeon Sub-Committee\" of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee looked at options for the Cold War. But while British operations were largely shut down, the CIA took over in exploiting pigeon power. Operation Tacana would grow out of work done in the 1960s that looked at uses for different animals. The files reveal that the CIA trained a raven to deliver and retrieve small objects of up to 40g from the window sill of inaccessible buildings. A flashing red laser beam was used to mark the target and a special lamp would draw the bird back. On one occasion in Europe, the CIA secretly delivered an eavesdropping device by bird to a window (although no audio was picked up from the intended target). The CIA also looked at whether migratory birds could be used to place sensors to detect whether the Soviet Union had tested chemical weapons. It also appears there were trials of some kind of electric brain stimulation to guide dogs remotely, although many of the details are still classified. A previously reported operation called Acoustic Kitty involved placing listening devices inside a cat. In the 1960s, the files show the CIA looked at using dolphins for \"harbour penetration\" either manned or unmanned. One problem was in handing over control from a trainer who had worked with a dolphin to a field agent. In Key West Florida, a team tried to use bottlenose dolphins for underwater attacks against enemy shipping. There were also tests on whether dolphins could carry sensors to collect the sounds of Soviet nuclear submarines or look for radioactive or biological weapons traces from nearby facilities. They also looked at whether dolphins could retrieve or place packages on ships on the move. By 1967, the CIA was spending more than $600,000 (£480,000) on three programmes - Oxygas for dolphins, Axiolite involving birds and Kechel with dogs and cats. The details are occasionally comic. One file details training using Canadian falcons out on a boat before mentioning they had tried using a cockatoo. \"We are completely in the dark as to what the possibilities are in regard to this critter,\" the author writes. Pigeons proved the most effective and by the mid 1970s the CIA began flying a series of test missions. One was over a prison, another over the Navy Yards in Washington DC. The camera cost $2,000 and weighed only 35g, the harness less than 5g. Tests showed that about half of the 140 pictures on a roll of film would be of good quality. The pictures show remarkably clear details of people walking and cars parked at the Navy Yard. Experts found that the quality of the photographs was higher than those produced by spy satellites operating at the time. One fear raised during the tests was if a member of the public stumbled upon \"pigeon and camera\" and assumed that the government was spying on its own, so an elaborate cover story was cooked up. The intended mission was for pigeons to be used against \"priority\" intelligence targets within the Soviet Union. The files indicate that the birds would be secretly shipped to Moscow. The CIA looked at lots of ways they could be released, possibly from under a thick overcoat or from a hole in the floor of a car when parked. They even looked at whether pigeons could be launched from a side window while the car was travelling at up to 50mph. A pigeon would be launched a few miles from a target installation and would then fly over it before returning to the place it had been trained to recognise as home. It appears from a September 1976 memo that a target had been selected - shipyards at Leningrad that built the most advanced Soviet submarines. At this point, it was decided the operation looked feasible. But, tantalisingly, that is where the story in the declassified files ends. How many actual missions did the spy-pigeons fly and what intelligence did they collect? That, apparently, is still secret.",

    "text": "By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent Iran's regional rivals have spent billions of dollars on Western weaponry, much of it from the UK. Yet for a fraction of that cost, sanctions-bound Iran has been able to successfully embed itself across the region into a position of strategic advantage. It has a major influence - verging on a controlling influence in some cases - over the affairs of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. 'Tipping the balance' The fact that Iran has stealthily built up a network of non-state alliances right across the Middle East, often referred to as \"proxy militias\", is nothing new. Starting with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Islamic Republic has been seeking to export its revolutionary ideology and expand its influence beyond its borders ever since the return of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Tehran in 1979. But the 217-page report by the IISS, entitled \"Iran's Networks of Influence in the Middle East\", provides unprecedented detail on the extent and reach of Iran's operations in the region. \"The Islamic Republic of Iran,\" says the report, \"has tipped the balance of effective force in the Middle East in its favour.\" It has achieved this, argue its authors, \"by countering superior conventional forces with influence operations and use of third-party forces\". The key ingredient here has been the Quds Force, the external operations wing of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). Both the Quds Force and its leader, Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, answer directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, bypassing Iran's conventional military structures to become effectively an independent entity. Since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003, the Quds Force has intensified its operations across the Middle East, providing training, funding and weapons to non-state actors allied to Tehran. It has also developed unconventional forms of asymmetric warfare - such as swarm tactics, drone and cyber-attacks - that have allowed Iran to offset its enemies' superiority in conventional weapons. In April, US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC, including the Quds Force, a \"foreign terrorist organisation\" (FTO). It was the first time the US had named a part of another government as an FTO. Iran reacted to Mr Trump's decision by designating the US military in the Gulf region as a terrorist entity, a largely symbolic gesture. Jack Straw, who was the UK's foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006 and who has visited Iran several times, believes that Gen Soleimani's role goes well beyond that of a military commander. \"Qasem Soleimani has basically been running their foreign policy in the region through alliances backed by force,\" he says. In response to the IISS report, a spokesman at the Iranian embassy in London told the BBC: \"If the report means that Iran's role in its region should be respected, it is a welcome sign. \"The policy of ignoring Iran did not work. Iran resisted. Iran has also successfully controlled damages of US economic terrorism. So yes, it is a powerful nation and has a lot of relations with other nations with a lot of initiatives for regional co-operation.\" Hezbollah - 'junior partner' The Lebanese Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah, which is both a political party and an armed militia, \"has achieved unique status among Iran's partners\", says the report, which documents in detail Iranian supply routes via Syria and Iraq. Hezbollah has played an important role in conflicts in both of those countries, fighting alongside Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and assisting Iraqi Shia militias. Although the report classifies Hezbollah as \"more akin to a trusted junior partner and a brother-in-arms for Iran than a proxy\", it nevertheless says the group has become a central interlocutor for an array of Arab militias and political parties with ties to Iran. Embedding into Iraq and Syria The US-led invasion of Iraq and the subsequent overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime completely changed the shape of the Middle East and provided Iran with ample opportunity to take advantage. Prior to that event, the Gulf Arab states saw Sunni Arab-ruled Iraq as something of a bulwark against any Iranian expansionism. With that bulwark gone, Iran has successfully capitalised on its religious and cultural ties inside Iraq - which has a Shia Arab majority - to become a dominant force in the country. It has armed and trained a paramilitary force called the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), which helped defeat IS but which many Iraqis see as a form of Iranian colonisation. But Iran has not had it all its own way. The recent mass demonstrations and violence across Iraq show that young people are far from happy with their Iranian-backed government. The report says \"the PMU's transition from a band of patriotic volunteers to an entrenched part of the country's ruling order has cost it popular support\". Jack Straw believes Iran may have taken on more than it can handle in Iraq. \"What's going on in Iraq is very serious for the Iranians as they risk losing control there,\" he says. The Syrian government has long been an Iranian ally. In the country's civil war, Iranian forces, Hezbollah and other Shia fighters, along with Russian air power, have been instrumental in helping President Assad survive and turn the tide against the rebels. Today, says the IISS report, \"Iran is embedding itself in the evolving Syrian government and informal security structures... enhancing its threat to Israel\". Disrupting Gulf rivals Iran would very much like the US to leave the region and to replace it as the dominant military power. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in particular, have no intention of letting that happen. When the Arab Spring protests erupted in 2011, Iran capitalised on the unrest in Bahrain. It tapped into legitimate grievances among that country's majority Shia population, but also helped to arm certain violent groups. \"Iran's support for militant groups in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is primarily meant to irritate and pressure their governments, and impose a political cost for their partnership with the United States,\" the report says. The security threat posed by these groups, says the IISS, is manageable. However, the drone and missile strikes on vital Saudi oil installations in September showed just how vulnerable the Gulf Arab states are to asymmetric attacks of this nature. Saudi Arabia had bought expensive missile defence systems from the US, but these were unable to stop this relatively low-tech attack that temporarily knocked out half its oil production capacity. The Saudi foreign ministry has said there is \"compelling evidence that the September attacks on Saudi oil installations were carried out by Iranian-made missiles fired from the north of the kingdom\". But Iran has denied any involvement. Another think tank, the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), also sees Iran having gained advantages through backing the groups that fit its purpose. \"Iran cannot compete with Saudi Arabia when it comes to conventional military capabilities - as such it has sought to use asymmetric tools to secure its interests and protect itself from external threats,\" it says. \"Relative to Saudi Arabia, Iran has backed the right players when it comes to winning the military battles.\" Yemen When Yemen descended into war in late 2014, there was very little Iranian involvement. But after Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015 with an air campaign aimed at dislodging the Houthi rebels from areas they had taken over, Iran stepped up its support. The IISS report maintains this includes the supply of advanced weaponry as part of Iran's aim to \"bog down at a limited cost its rival Saudi Arabia but also to establish a forward presence in the strategic [Red Sea] area of Bab al-Mandab\". The Yemen war has certainly bogged down the Saudis, costing them billions of dollars and triggering the launches of more than 200 missiles and drones across the border from Yemen. \"The Iranians have provided ballistic missiles to terrorist organisations, such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions,\" the Saudi foreign ministry says. The damage to Saudi Arabia however, while alarming, has been dwarfed by the destruction wreaked by the war on Yemen, notably by Saudi-led air power. There have been no winners in this catastrophic war. Both Saudi Arabia and its ally, the UAE, believe their principal achievement in Yemen has been to prevent Iran from gaining a permanent foothold in their backyard. Maximum effect, minimum cost The report concludes that Iran is unlikely to change course while Mr Trump remains in the White House and will \"continue to seize opportunities to expand its third-party capability\". As Tehran feels the squeeze from sanctions reinstated by the president last year in an attempt to force it to negotiate a new nuclear deal, the temptation among hardline factions to lash out will only grow. \"Iran is likely to continue its defiant response to widening US sanctions,\" says the Texas-based geopolitical think tank, Stratfor. \"The next six weeks offer Iran several possible opportunities for conducting attacks against Saudi Arabia and other US allies in the Middle East.\" The fact that Iran now has such an extensive and geographically dispersed network of alliances gives it ample scope to conduct deniable operations at arms' length, should it choose to. These could range from missile and drone attacks, ambushes on US military forces in Iraq, disruption of maritime traffic around the Strait of Hormuz, to sophisticated cyber-attacks that target Israel or the Gulf Arab states. The bottom line is this: after 40 years of steadily recruiting, funding and arming its network of alliances, Iran is now in a far stronger position than it would appear. Yes, the sanctions are biting and its population is suffering the effects. Economically, Iran is in a dreadful place. But the IRGC's Quds Force has built up a system of alliances that allows it to bring about maximum effect for minimum cost. Strategically, through the network described in the IISS report, Iran has become a force to be reckoned with.",

Pitt was among the first US stars to promote a movie - in person - in India. Christian Bale and Will Smith followed closely on his heels. Strangely, they weren't the emissaries of giant studios such as Warner Brothers or Sony. Instead, they had come at the behest of a new media titan - Netflix. The California-based streaming giant's interest in India was put into sharper focus last week, after it reported a loss of 126,000 paying customers in the US, its home market. As Netflix's stratospheric stock price took a dive, the company also announced a cheaper, mobile-only subscription plan in India. At 199 rupees ($2.8; £2.2) a month, it's priced to make inroads into a country, which chief executive Reed Hastings has half-seriously suggested could be the source of Netflix's \"next 100 million\" subscribers. But despite pouring money into Indian-made and original titles such as Sacred Games, Chopsticks and Lust Stories, Netflix's footprint in India is relatively small. In a country of 1.3 billion people, it's estimated that the company has between four and six million customers. By comparison, the homegrown (but Disney-owned) rival Hotstar boasts 300 million monthly active users, according to consulting firm RedSeer. India is a \"highly price sensitive market\", explains Rajib Basu, a partner at consulting firm PwC India. He says Netflix has thus far targeted a limited sub-section of \"very educated, suave Indian consumers, who have a liking for international content as well as some original [Indian] content in English and Hindi.\" In a country that offers cable connections and mobile data at rock-bottom prices, and uses advertising to subsidise cheap subscriptions, Netflix had hoped its highly-produced titles would stand out, and convince viewers to swallow higher costs. By contrast, Hotstar lured customers with live cricket matches, and Amazon offered free delivery as part of its Prime content package. The market is also peppered with dozens of smaller, specialist providers, that are sold as part of a bundle with mobile phone contracts. But unlike North America and Europe, India is by no means a saturated market - and with its almost insatiable appetite for original content, enormous rewards await the companies that eventually emerge victorious in the war for eyeballs. Consulting firm EY estimates that digital subscriptions in India grew by some 262% last year, to a total of INR14.2 billion ($205m). That expansion, EY found, was driven largely by sign-ups to video platforms - a trend that is expected to be supercharged by the arrival of 5G connectivity. There is plenty of room for new providers too. Consulting firm BCG has calculated that Indians spend just 4.6 hours each day consuming media (including print, TV, radio, digital), far behind Americans, who spend an average of 11.8 hours. The key to boosting those numbers, for Netflix or its rivals, \"is going to ride on the further penetration of tier two or tier three cities\", PwC's Mr Basu maintains. In those places, he explains, high-speed broadband and cable TV are not as pervasive, but smartphones are ubiquitous. \"I would doubt if Netflix would achieve [their expansion goals] by remaining in the market that they are,\" he says. \"They will have to keep on churning out shows like Sacred Games, but they need more local language content too.\" Rohit Khilnani, who currently works for the news channel NDTV, agrees. \"They have to tap the small towns, they have to tap the villages,\" he says, and that means mobile-friendly subscriptions. But customers in those places, he warns, are living on tight budgets and have limited storage capacity on their phones. They are unlikely to stump for more than one subscription service, and \"eventually, only the best will survive\". Netflix's grand plans could come undone if regulators get involved. The company will likely have watched with trepidation the recent attempt by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to allow TV subscribers in India to pay only for the channels which they wish to watch. If translated into the streaming market, it could lead to the emergence of a so-called \"super aggregator\" - a catch-all platform that would allow customers pay much smaller amounts for specific programmes, rather than for monthly plans. Judging by its spending, Netflix is certainly determined to be among the survivors. It has increased its investment in India at a faster rate than any other market, and has 13 new films and nine new original series in the pipeline. The hope is that these titles - a mixture of drama, horror and comedy, made in collaboration with huge Bollywood names such as Shah Rukh Khan - will follow thriller series Sacred Games and Amazon's cricket soap Inside Edge in attracting big audiences beyond Indian shores. If successful, Indian hits - which are cheaper to produce than those made in the US - could help Netflix in its battle to stand up to streaming entrants such as Disney, Apple and HBO back home. Yet those sharks, Rohit Khilnani says, could be circling in India too. With its family-friendly collections, he predicts, Disney would be a huge hit in the world's second-most populous country, and could even eclipse Netflix. \"The library that Disney offers,\" he says, \"I don't think anyone in the world can beat that\".",

    "text": "The judge dismissed his appeal, saying it paved the way for his execution. Mullah had been scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, before gaining a reprieve. No new date has been set. He was convicted in February of crimes against humanity during the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. The senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denies the charges. Jamaat says that the trial is politically motivated. Mullah's defence lawyer Abdur Razzak told the BBC that his client had been denied justice and that the case against him relied on the testimony of just one witness. But Attorney-General Mahbubey Alam told the BBC that \"since the review petition filed by Kader Mullah has already been dismissed by our highest court - namely the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh - there is no legal bar to proceed in the execution order\". Mr Alam said that Mullah had exhausted all avenues of appeal. But Mullah's lawyers dispute his conclusions. His final hope rests with a presidential pardon. His trial earlier this year sparked protests from Jamaat supporters. They accuse the government of pursuing a political vendetta which has resulted in the imprisonment of several of the party's senior leaders. Security was stepped up in Dhaka in advance of Thursday's ruling. Mullah is one of five Islamist leaders condemned to death by Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), set up in 2010 to investigate atrocities committed during the 1971 conflict. Nobody knows exactly how many people were killed. Independent researchers think that between 300,000 and 500,000 died. The Bangladesh government puts the figure at three million. Counter-demonstrations So far none of those convicted of war crimes has been executed. Mullah - who is assistant secretary-general of Jamaat - was initially sentenced to life imprisonment for killing unarmed civilians and intellectuals in the Mirpur suburb of the capital Dhaka. Thousands of protesters took to the streets demanding the death penalty, a move that prompted parliament to amend a law allowing the state to appeal against any verdict reached by the war crimes tribunal. The Supreme Court then passed a death sentence, enraging Jammat supporters. While the government explains the need to bring war criminals to justice, Jamaat has hit back with talk of Islam being under threat. BBC Bengali Editor Sabir Mustafa says that Bangladesh is divided between Bengalis wanting to preserve their cultural and linguistic heritage and those wanting to foster a more overtly Islamist identity. Our correspondent says that the divisions go to the heart of the country's identity. The government set up the special court to deal with those accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces who attempted to stop East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then, from becoming an independent country. The two wings of Pakistan were held together mostly by a shared religion, Bangladesh broke away from Pakistan 42 years ago after a war which saw killings on a mass scale, the exodus of more than 10 million refugees and military intervention by neighbouring India. Human rights groups have said the special court falls short of international standards and that Mullah have another opportunity to appeal. Jamaat is barred from contesting elections scheduled for 5 January but plays a key role in the opposition movement led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).",

    "text": "Prince Miteb, once seen as a contender to the throne, was freed after agreeing an \"acceptable settlement\" with authorities of more than $1bn (£750m). He was one of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen detained in an anti-corruption drive on 4 November. At least three others have also agreed settlements, the officials said. \"Yes, Prince Miteb was released this morning [Tuesday],\" a source close to the government told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The prince has so far not commented, and it was not clear whether he was now able to move freely or whether he was under some form of house arrest. The 65-year-old son of the late King Abdullah was the most politically influential royal detained under the orders of a newly formed anti-corruption committee headed by his 32-year-old cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Miteb was minister of the National Guard, an elite security force with 100,000 personnel that is tasked with protecting royal leaders, but was sacked hours before his detention. An official involved in the investigation told Reuters news agency the settlement agreed by the prince \"included admitting corruption involving known cases\". The authorities have not publicly named any of the 208 people who Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said had been \"called in for questioning\". They have also not released any details of the charges they faced, and are not believed to have given them access to their lawyers. Prince Miteb was reportedly held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh along with his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province; the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the TV network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; and Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court. In an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said 95% of those so far detained in the anti-corruption drive had agreed to hand over cash or shares to the Saudi state once \"we show them all the files that we have\". \"About one per cent are able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there,\" he added. \"About four per cent say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court. Prince Mohammed also said it was \"ludicrous\" that analysts had suggested the campaign was a power grab. He noted that many of those detained had publicly pledged allegiance to him when his 81-year-old father, King Salman, named him first-in-line to the throne in June. The prince hopes to recover much of the $100bn that the attorney general said was \"misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades\". Many ordinary Saudis have welcomed the move to tackle corruption with the hope that some of their nation's oil wealth will be redistributed to the general population.",

    "text": "Munira Abdulla, who was aged 32 at the time of the accident, suffered a severe brain injury after the car she was travelling in collided with a bus on the way to pick up her son from school. Omar Webair, who was then just four years old, was sitting in the back of the vehicle with her, but was left unscathed as his mother cradled him in her arms moments before the accident. Ms Abdulla - who was being driven by her brother-in-law - was left seriously injured, but last year regained consciousness in a German hospital. Omar has opened up about the accident and about his mother's progress following years of treatment in an interview with the UAE-based newspaper The National. 'She hugged me to protect me' \"I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she would wake up,\" Omar told the newspaper on Monday. \"The reason I shared her story is to tell people not to lose hope on their loved ones; don't consider them dead when they are in such a state,\" he added. \"My mother was sitting with me in the back seat. When she saw the crash coming, she hugged me to protect me from the blow.\" He was unharmed, suffering just a bruise to the head, but his mother was left untreated for hours. Years of treatment Ms Abdulla was eventually taken to hospital, and later transferred to London. There, she was declared to be in a vegetative state - unresponsive, but able to sense pain - The National reports. She was then returned to Al Ain, a city in the UAE on the border with Oman where she lived, and moved to various medical facilities according to insurance requirements. She remained there for a few years, fed through a tube and kept alive. She underwent physiotherapy to ensure her muscles would not weaken through lack of movement. In 2017, the family was offered a grant by the Crown Prince Court, a government body in Abu Dhabi, for Ms Abdulla to be transferred to Germany. There, she underwent a number of surgeries to correct her severely shortened arm and leg muscles, and she was given medication to improve her state, including her wakefulness. Hospital row A year later, her son was involved in an argument in her hospital room, which seemed to prompt his mother to stir. \"There was a misunderstanding in the hospital room and she sensed I was at risk, which caused her a shock,\" Omar said. \"She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her, they said everything was normal. \"Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name. \"It was her! She was calling my name, I was flying with joy; for years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said.\" She became more responsive, and can now feel pain and have some conversations. She has returned to Abu Dhabi, where she is undergoing physiotherapy and further rehabilitation - mainly to improve her posture when sitting and prevent muscles from contracting. Cases like Abdulla's are rare There are only a few cases of people recovering consciousness after several years - and even then, recovery can be protracted. It is impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving, says the UK's National Health Service. People who do regain consciousness often have severe disabilities caused by damage to their brain. One notable recovery case is that of Terry Wallis, an American man who was involved in a car accident when he was 19, and made a dramatic recovery after spending 19 years in a near-vegetative state. It was thought he had been able to re-grow brain tissue. Former Formula 1 racing world champion Michael Schumacher suffered a head injury in a skiing accident in France in 2013. He was placed in a medically induced coma for six months before being transferred to his home in Switzerland to continue his treatment.",

    "text": "By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing China's new \"Elderly Rights Law\" deals with the growing problem of lonely elderly people by ordering adult children to visit their ageing parents. The law says adults should care about their parents \"spiritual needs\" and \"never neglect or snub elderly people\". The regulation has been ridiculed by tens of thousands of Chinese web users. Many across China are questioning how the law could be enforced, since it fails to spell out a detailed schedule dictating the frequency with which children should make parental house calls. \"Those who live far away from parents should go home often,\" it says. However, that does not mean the law is toothless. Instead, it serves as an \"educational message\" to the public, while also serving as a starting point for law suits, explained Zhang Yan Feng, a lawyer with Beijing's King & Capital Law Firm. \"It's hard to put this law into practice, but not impossible,\" Mr Zhang explained. \"If a case is brought to court on the basis of this law, I think it'll probably end up in a peaceful settlement. But if no settlement is reached, technically speaking, court rulings can force the person to visit home certain times a month.\" \"If this person disobeys court rulings, he could be fined or detained.\" 'Spontaneous emotions' But few in China seem to fear they will end up behind bars if they fail to log visits home. \"Who doesn't want to visit home often? What is considered \"often\"? Who will oversee the process?\" complained one poster on weibo, China's version of Twitter. \"We all know to cherish our elderly parents, but sometimes we are just too busy trying to make a living and the pressure is too much.\" \"It's fine that no-one is paying for us to visit our parents, but is there someone who can give us time off to do it?\" asked another. The question of how to deal with ageing parents is a mounting problem in China. According to Chinese government statistics, more than 178 million people in China were 60 years or older in 2010. By 2030, that figure will double. As China's population goes grey, the Chinese media fills with stories of neglected old people. Many were shocked by the story of a 91-year-old grandmother who was beaten and forced out of her home in China's southern Jiangsu province after she asked her daughter-in-law for a bowl of rice porridge. Two days later, internet forums were filled with a similar story of farmers in the same province who allowed their family's 100-year-old matriarch to sleep in a pig sty, sharing close quarters with a pungent pig. But those stories have not lead most people to support the new Elderly Rights Law. \"Family bonds should be based on spontaneous emotions,\" argued one weibo user. \"It's funny to make it part of a law; it's like requiring couples to have a harmonious sex life after marriage.\"",

Twitter said it had taken the decision due to its \"ongoing and global effort to build trust\". It follows renewed scrutiny over fake news and users on social media. The new measures mean that any user whose account is locked for unusual activity - such as being blocked or sending unusual volumes of Tweets - and who did not respond to a prompt to verify their identity would be excluded from Twitter follower counts. The head of the company's legal team, Vijaya Gadde, said that most accounts would only lose around four followers as a result of the new measures. But she warned that more popular accounts would \"experience a more significant drop\". Nowhere has this been more true than with Twitter's own account on the platform, which lost 7.7 million followers.

    "text": "By Toby LuckhurstBBC News Nazi Germany was on its knees. Soviet troops were closing in on Berlin, while Allied forces had crossed Germany's western border. In the Pacific, US troops were steadily but bloodily advancing towards Japan. As their armies poised for victory, the so-called Big Three - US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin - agreed to meet in Yalta, a Soviet resort on the Black Sea. At the end of the bloodiest conflict the world had ever known, 75 years ago, the Allies wanted to stop such devastation from ever happening again. But both the US and the USSR wanted co-operation on their own terms. Despite the Yalta agreements, within months the stage was set for the Cold War - the struggle between the two new superpowers that split the globe into ideological camps for decades. \"If the goal at Yalta was to lay the basis for a genuinely peaceful post-war order, then the conference failed,\" Prof Andrew Bacevich at Boston University told the BBC. \"But given the contradictory aspirations of the US and USSR, that goal was never in the cards.\" What was happening in February 1945? By the start of 1945 Nazi Germany had lost the war. The country maintained its bloody and increasingly desperate resistance, but the result of the conflict was no longer in doubt. In eastern Europe, the Soviet Union had turned the tide and shattered Germany's armies after four years of savage warfare. But while the USSR was militarily triumphant - about three-quarters of all German troop casualties in the war died on the Eastern Front - the country had suffered terribly. It is estimated that one in seven Soviet citizens, some 27 million people, died in the conflict - two-thirds of whom were civilians. Some academics put the numbers even higher. The country's cities and richest lands were devastated by the conflict. Industry, farms, homes and even roads had been wiped from the landscape. What were the leaders' goals? Joseph Stalin was determined to get his country back on its feet. He came to Yalta seeking a sphere of influence in eastern Europe as a buffer zone to protect the USSR. He also wanted to divide Germany, to ensure it could never pose a threat again, and to take huge reparations - in money, machinery and even men - to help his shattered nation. Stalin knew he would need the acceptance of the Western powers to achieve this. Winston Churchill understood Stalin's goals. The pair had met in Moscow in October 1944, and discussed the idea of carving Europe into spheres of influence for the USSR and the western powers. He also understood that the millions of Soviet troops that had pushed Germany out of central and eastern Europe far outnumbered the Allied forces in the west - and there was nothing the UK could do if Stalin chose to keep them there. The UK had declared war in September 1939 because Germany had invaded its ally, Poland, and Churchill was determined to ensure the country's freedom. The UK however had also paid a heavy price for victory, and was now essentially bankrupt. Churchill hoped the US would support him and stand up to Stalin. But US President Roosevelt had his own priorities. He wanted Stalin to sign up to the United Nations - a new global peacekeeping body for the post-war world. Prof Melvyn Leffler at the University of Virginia told the BBC that Roosevelt was well aware how acrimony between allies after World War One had led the US to step back from world politics in the 1920s and 1930s. \"What Roosevelt wanted most of all was to avert a return to American isolationism,\" he said. The president also wanted the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan. Though the tide had dramatically turned against the Japanese Empire, their forces were still inflicting heavy casualties on advancing US forces in the Pacific. Anxiety about a bloody invasion of the Japanese home islands loomed large in US strategic thinking. What happened at Yalta? Although Roosevelt wanted to meet somewhere in the Mediterranean, Stalin - who had a fear of flying - instead offered up Yalta. Group talks took place between 4-11 February at the US delegation's residence, Livadia Palace, which was once the summer home of Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II. The three leaders had met before, at Tehran in 1943. Roosevelt was more willing to trust Stalin than was Churchill, who saw the Soviet leader as an increasingly dangerous threat. After a week of talks, the Big Three announced their decisions to the world. Following its unconditional surrender, Germany would be broken apart. The leaders agreed in principle to four occupation zones, one for each country at Yalta and also for France, and the same division of Berlin. A declaration also said Germany would pay reparations \"to the greatest extent possible\", and a commission would be created in Moscow to determine how much they owed. The leaders also agreed to democratic elections throughout liberated Europe - including for Poland, which would have a new government \"with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad\". The Soviet Union had already placed a provisional Communist government in Warsaw, which they agreed would be expanded. But democracy meant something very different to Stalin. Though he publicly agreed to free elections for liberated Europe, his forces were already seizing key offices of state across central and eastern European countries for local communist parties. Moreover, the leaders decided - at Stalin's urging - that Poland's borders were to move westward, giving land to the USSR. The Baltic States would also join the Soviet Union. Historian Anne Applebaum wrote in her text Iron Curtain that the leaders \"decided the fate of whole swathes of Europe with amazing insouciance\". Roosevelt \"half-heartedly\" asked Stalin if the city of Lwow might stay a part of Poland, but did not push the idea, and it was quickly dropped. Roosevelt was more focused on his plan for the United Nations, and he got his wish. All three nations agreed to send delegates to San Francisco on 25 April 1945, to help set up the new international organisation. What's more, Stalin pledged to launch an invasion of Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. Churchill remained deeply concerned about the situation in eastern Europe after the summit, despite the agreements. He urged his forces and the Americans to move as far east as possible before the end of the war. What happened afterwards? Within months, the political situation had changed dramatically. Roosevelt died of a massive brain haemorrhage in April, and was replaced by Harry Truman. Germany surrendered unconditionally in May. And on 16 July, the US successfully tested its new secret weapon - the nuclear bomb. The very next day, President Truman met Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam conference outside Berlin. Truman did not know Stalin, and had been president for just four months. Winston Churchill, in power since May 1940, was replaced halfway through the conference by Clement Atlee after the 1945 general election. The mood at the conference was very different. US policymakers felt more confident after realising the power of the atomic bomb. Truman was far more sceptical of Stalin than Roosevelt had been. He and his advisers believed the USSR had no desire to stick to the Yalta accords. In less than two years, the US president announced the so-called Truman Doctrine, which pledged US power to contain Soviet expansion efforts around the world. The Cold War had begun. Both Churchill and Roosevelt were later criticised for giving way to Stalin at Yalta. But practically, there was little the US and UK could do. Stalin already had troops throughout central and eastern Europe. After Yalta, Churchill commissioned a plan of attack against the USSR - codenamed Operation Unthinkable - but British military planners realised it was totally unrealistic. Prof Leffler says that \"what Yalta did in regard to eastern Europe was simply to acknowledge the power realities that existed at the time\".",

    "text": "By Reality Check & Visual JournalismBBC News The 400m (1300ft) Ever Given was stuck in the mud and sand right across the southern end of the canal since Tuesday. How was the ship moved? A fleet of tugs using cables or placing themselves directly alongside the stricken ship, worked for many days to free it. Ship tracking software shows the ship now free from both banks and moving northwards along the canal. As tugs struggled in their attempts to move the ship through the week, dredgers were brought in to dig mud and sand from under the bow and stern of the ship. These dredgers are a familiar sight on the Suez Canal, said maritime expert Sal Mercogliano, and are used to continually dredge the waterway to keep it navigable. \"Large machines stick down into the water and basically pull dirt up from the bottom, which you can then deposit onshore.\" The company which manages the running of the vessel, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) said an additional specialist \"suction dredger\" had been brought in, able to shift 2,000 cubic metres (440,000 gallons) of material every hour. The combination of the tug boats and dredging equipment dislodged the ship. If these had failed, there would have been a third option - removing some cargo and fuel from the boat. It would have required a delicate and lengthy operation. Draining fuel from the ship's tanks might have helped, but was unlikely to be sufficient without other load-lightening measures. A ship the size of the Ever Given can carry as many as 20,000 twenty-foot containers and an operation to remove these by crane would have been highly challenging. Apart from the difficulties associated with getting suitable cranes close enough to the ship, the process could have caused damage and even unbalanced the ship.

The letter was signed \"By The Cyber Powers Vested In Me\". But the jokes have since subsided, and Zimbabweans are now considering what the new ministry will mean for their civil liberties - especially freedom of speech. 'A threat to the state' Zimbabwe's government has been uneasy about social media after pastor Evan Mawararire spearheaded the #ThisFlag movement last year. Using platforms like Twitter and Facebook it organised a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. President Robert Mugabe's spokesperson, George Charamba, says Mr Mugabe came up with the idea of a new ministry to deal with an \"emerging threat to the state... a threat founded on abuse and unlawful conduct\". Social media is possibly the primary platform Zimbabweans use to communicate and receive news. It is thriving despite restrictive laws governing freedom of expression. Over the last 16 years, internet usage in the country has grown from 0.3% penetration to 46%, data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) shows. Several TV stations and online publications, some operating from the diaspora, use the internet to disseminate news out of the reach of the government. When petrol stations ran out of fuel last month, there were dramatic scenes of long queues at supermarket as Zimbabweans stocked up, anticipating food shortages. Worried by these events, the government blamed social media messages for spreading panic. \"Social media was abused to create a sense of panic, thereby creating some sort of destabilising in the economy,\" says Mr Charamba. The new cyber security minister, Mr Chinamasa, agrees. He commented at the time, before his appointment, that \"the cause basically was social media\". \"It means it's a security issue,\" he adds. \"It is also a political agenda, a regime change agenda. We are going to look at what exactly happened with a view to take corrective measures in the security arena.\" 'Muzzling' opinion But others say the government's stance is a threat to civil liberties. One communications rights group, the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), says this new scrutiny of social media goes against the spirit of the constitution and freedom of expression. \"These unfortunate threats have resulted in self-censorship by [individuals] when engaging on topical issues affecting the country,\" it said in a statement. It also criticises censorship of Zimbabwe's media, \"who have on occasion been chastised for incorporating citizen opinion as expressed online in their reportage\". Going a step further, Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says the government's new cyber threat ministry is a means for government to spy on its people. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also believes that the ministry has been created to curb free speech in time for the 2018 polls. \"Mugabe... will do whatever it takes to control and muzzle social media in order to suppress public discontent against his regime,\" he said. \"However the good news is that the regime has no capacity to suppress the use of social media.\" Many Zimbabweans have reacted wryly to the news of the creation of a cyber minister, referring to Mr Chinamasa as the \"Minister of WhatsApp\". Some say the ridicule shows a lack of understanding about the global threat of cyber crime. Others see a link between the government's scrutiny of online communication and the forthcoming elections. Zimbabwe already has several pieces of legislation which rights groups say curb freedom of expression. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says that since 2010, it has assisted more than 100 people arrested under a law which makes it a jailable offence to \"insult the president\" and \"undermine his authority\". Ordinary people have been arrested and charged for calling the 93-year-old leader \"old\", \"a donkey\" and even for accusing him of ruining the country. The Zimbabwean government has said new legislation will not stifle freedom of expression and will protect the public from new threats such as revenge pornography and cyber attacks. Presidential spokesperson Mr Charamba says Zimbabwe will look closely at how other nations have dealt with the threat of cybercrime - including Russia, China, and South Korea \"who have faced similar challenges\". Arrests ahead? While several countries around the world have anti-cyber crime departments and agencies, Zimbabwe is among the first to create an entire ministry. Meanwhile on social media, ominous warnings have begun circulating. One is from a \"Mr Chaipa\", urging Zimbabweans only to share content on social media that they would be able to defend in court. Mr Chaipa said it was easy for the government to monitor online messages, and gave a list of online activities that could be classified as criminal offences. \"In the coming months a lot of people will be arrested and used as examples to deter people from 'abusing' social media towards the elections,\" he warns. \"Don't be made an example.\"",

    "text": "The high court ordered that \"virgin\" be replaced with \"unmarried\". The other two options on the form - \"widow\" and \"divorced\" - remain unchanged. Women's rights groups - who had argued the word \"virgin\" was humiliating - welcomed Sunday's verdict. Separately, the court said grooms now also must declare their marital status. Marriage laws in the Muslim-majority Bangladesh have been criticised by women's rights groups as restrictive and discriminatory. Many girls in the country are forced into arranged marriages at a very young age. What did the court rule? The court said the Bengali word \"kumari\" must be removed from marriage registration forms. The word is used to describe unmarried women, but it can also mean \"virgin\". Lawyers for the groups who filed the case in 2014 had successfully argued that the marriage forms were humiliating and breached women's privacy. On Sunday, the court said the Bengali word \"obibahita\", which unambiguously means \"an unmarried woman\" - must be used from now on instead of \"kumari\". In a separate ruling, the court required grooms to state whether they are unmarried, divorced or widowed. The changes are expected to come into force in a few months when the full court verdict is officially published. What has the reaction been? \"It is a landmark verdict,\" Aynun Nahar Siddiqua, a lawyer involved in the case, was quoted as saying. She said she hoped the ruling would help advance women's rights in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, a local marriage registrar said he and his colleagues were now waiting for the authorities to officially inform them about the changes in the form. \"I have conducted many marriages in Dhaka and I have often been asked why men have the liberty to not disclose their status but women don't. I always told them this wasn't in my hands,\" registrar Mohammad Ali Akbar Sarker told Reuters. \"I guess I won't be asked that question anymore,\" he added.",

    "text": "Little died in a California hospital on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. He was serving a life sentence for the murder of three women. But by the time of his death, he had confessed to killing 93 women between 1970 and 2005. Little targeted vulnerable individuals, many of whom were sex workers or drug users, officials say. A former competitive boxer, Little would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always obvious signs, like stab or bullet wounds, the person had been murdered. Instead many deaths were incorrectly determined to be overdoses or accidental and were never investigated. Some bodies have never been found, the agency said. Last year, the FBI said its analysts believed all of his confessions were \"credible\". They also released images of the victims he drew while in prison in an attempt to trace those he killed. Little was arrested in 2012 on a drugs charge in Kentucky and extradited to California, where officers carried out DNA testing on him. He already had an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape across the US. The DNA results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989 in Los Angeles County. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole.",

    "text": "By David GrossmanUS correspondent, BBC Newsnight So what does the United States want from China - and what is the US endgame? The short answer is the phase-one trade deal that President Trump and the Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He shook hands on in the Oval office last month. But tensions between the two countries go far deeper than just trade, and no one I've spoken to in Washington thinks that this outline deal will make much difference on its own. There has been a pronounced negative shift in attitudes to China in the US in recent years, and it's important to realise that this shift predates Mr Trump's arrival in the White House. \"I think if you'd seen a Hillary Clinton presidency, or another Democrat or another Republican in 2016, you would have seen this sharp turn,\" says Daniel Kliman, a former senior adviser at the US defence department. \"There was a sense that our approach to China wasn't working,\" says Dr Kliman, now director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). There are many reasons for this rise in tensions. The promised economic benefits of China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 never materialised, says Ray Bowen, who worked for the US government as an economic analyst from 2001 until 2018. China never intended to play by the rules, he says. \"It's more the case that China intended to join multilateral fora in order to begin to shift how multinational fora regulate global trade.\" In other words, China joined intending to change rather than be changed. The result was a vast wave of job losses and factory closures in the US known as the \"China shock\". The so-called \"rust belt states\" that voted for President Trump in 2016 bore the brunt. Many US companies moved production to China to take advantage of lower labour costs. However, according to Daniel Kliman there was a high price for companies moving to China: \"China has forced them to hand over their technology, their intellectual property,\" he says. And, even those companies that didn't relocate production found that China somehow got hold of their trade secrets. Law enforcement agencies in the US have a long list of charges against Chinese individuals and companies for spying and computer hacking. The FBI's director, Christopher Wray, recently told US Congress that there are currently at least 1,000 current investigations into the theft of intellectual property from American firms that lead back to China. The US government has estimated that the total value of intellectual property stolen by China in the four years to 2017 alone to be $1.2tn (£936bn). According to Dean Cheng of the Heritage Foundation, a US conservative think tank, this is the primary reason relations between the US and China have soured. \"When companies are finding out that their patents are being rifled through, when their product is being reverse engineered, when their R&D processes are being hijacked, more and more companies concluded that partnering with China was not turning out to be profitable, and could actually be downright negative,\" he says. From inside government, economic analyst Ray Bowen says he noticed the mood change in late 2015. People who had previously advocated engagement with China were now alarmed to see how fast China was catching up. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power. Read more Rivals features At the same time in the Pentagon, Brig Gen Robert Spalding was leading a team of people trying to formulate a new national security strategy to deal with China's rise and influence. He has since left the military, and has written a book called \"Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite Slept\". When asked about the threat that China poses to US interests, Gen Spalding's reply is stark. \"It's the most consequential existential threat since the Nazi party in World War Two. \"I think it's a far greater threat than the Soviet Union ever was. As the number two economy in the world, its reach, particularly into the governments and in all the institutions of the West, far exceeds what the Soviets could ever manage.\" The result of Gen Spalding's work at the Pentagon was the National Security Strategy, published in December 2017. It's regarded as the lead document within government, designed to guide every department, and represents a profound shift in approach according to Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"There has now been a movement away from the war on terror, and instead, competition among major powers has taken the place of terrorism as the major threat to the United States,\" she says. The US defence department now believes that addressing the rise of China is one of the major military objectives of the United States in the coming decades. The speed with which China built, and then militarised, a string of artificial islands in the South China Sea in defiance of international law has alarmed many in Washington. According to Dean Cheng, $5.3tn of trade passes through the area every year. \"China's actions were in a sense an attempt to be able to cut the carotid artery of global trade,\" he says. China has been very clear in its ambitions to lead the world in the important technologies of the future, like robotics and AI. \"This is very core to the competition now,\" says Bonnie Glaser, \"because if China were to succeed in these areas, then it probably would supplant the United States as the leading power in the world.\" That is what is now at stake. America's military supremacy is based not on a huge standing army, but on high-tech weapons systems. If China takes the lead in these crucial technologies, then the US may not be able to keep up for long. Daniel Kliman believes that the non-military technological race is also crucial. \"Not only is China perfecting technologies for surveillance and censorship at home, but increasingly exporting these technologies as well as finance and knowhow abroad.\" He believes the battle with what he calls \"high tech authoritarianism\" is one that will become more and more central to the conversation about China. So, don't expect the US position on China to change in the near term, even if President Trump loses the coming election. The mood in Washington has changed. The only real political conversation is not about whether to take on China but how best to do it. Many Democrats prefer engaging with allies against President Trump's unilateral approach. However, most Democrats know there are few votes to be had by advocating a softer China policy. Rivals - America's Endgame, will be broadcast on BBC World News on Sat 9 November at 07:30 and 19:30 GMT and Sun 10 November at 11:30 and 16:30 GMT. It will be available to UK viewers on iPlayer from 17 November.",

    "text": "Divers found bags containing her head, legs and clothing in Koge Bay, just south of Copenhagen, the city's police inspector Jens Moller Jensen said. They were found not far from where Ms Wall's torso was discovered 11 days after she boarded Peter Madsen's submarine on 10 August. Mr Madsen, 46, denies murdering her. He also denies a charge of mutilating her corpse. Mr Moller Jensen said the bags, found on Friday, had been weighed down with pieces of metal. \"Yesterday morning we found a bag within which we found Kim Wall's clothes, underwear, stockings, and shoes. In the same bag laid a knife, and there were some car pipes to weigh the bag down,\" he said. He said a post-mortem examination confirmed the head was Ms Wall's and that it showed \"no sign of fracture... [or] any sign of other blunt violence to the skull\". This would seem to contradict Mr Madsen's statement that she had died after hitting her head on a hatch. Ms Wall, 30, was last seen alive on the evening of 10 August as she departed with Mr Madsen on his self-built 40-tonne submarine, UC3 Nautilus, for a story she was writing about his venture. Her boyfriend raised the alarm the next day when she did not return from the trip. Initially, Mr Madsen said he had dropped her off safely in Copenhagen, but he later changed his story to say it had been a \"terrible accident\", that he had \"buried her at sea\" and planned afterwards to take his own life by sinking his submarine. Ms Wall's torso was found on 21 August; a post-mortem examination revealed knife wounds to her genitals and ribcage, which were believed to have been caused \"around or shortly after her death\". Danish Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told a court earlier this month that footage of women being decapitated alive had been found on a hard drive believed to belong to Mr Madsen. Mr Madsen, who denied the hard drive was his, was detained for a further four weeks while investigations into the case continue.",

    "text": "Mr Macron told the Financial Times it was \"naive\" to suggest China had dealt better with the crisis, adding things \"happened that we don't know about\". More people have died in the US and several European countries than in China where the virus emerged. The US and the UK have also cast doubt on China's figures and the speed with which it responded or alerted others. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's measures. Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than 145,000 have died. The US,France, Italy and Spain are amongst the worst affected countries. What's behind this French-Chinese confrontation? France has seen 141,000 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths. China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted. Local officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate. President Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes. The article - by an unnamed diplomat - was seen by France as a reference to the situation in its care homes, which make up a large number of deaths attributed to the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. China dismissed the row as a \"misunderstanding\". Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic \"and has no intention of making any\". Mr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed. \"Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this,\" he said. \"We don't know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about.\" He said that abandoning freedoms to fight the pandemic would threaten Western democracies. \"We can't accept that. You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis.\" What is China being accused of? Many Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. The UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that \"hard questions\" would have be asked about how the outbreak started \"and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier\". He said there would have to be a \"deep dive\" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be \"business as usual\" after the crisis. US President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China. On Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: \"Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?\" he said, naming China. He said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city. Fox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols. The Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials sent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab. US intelligence agencies have taken an interest, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said on Tuesday. \"We've had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain.\" There is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus was released accidentally from a lab, says the BBC's science editor Paul Rincon. One online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, who note that studies show the virus originated in animals - most likely in bats.",

    "text": "The 15-year-old, from Bethnal Green, is thought to have left the UK in December to join Islamic State (IS) militants. Sharmeena's father told the Daily Mail he had warned teachers at Bethnal Green Academy to keep an eye on three of her friends who have since disappeared. Amira Abase, 15, Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, are now believed to have joined her in Syria. All four teenagers are thought to be in Raqqa - the headquarters of IS. 'Not coming back' Sharmeena Begum's father Mohammad Uddin told the Daily Mail he had warned the police to watch out for her three schoolmates after his own daughter went missing, as they were best friends. Mr Uddin, a waiter at a central London restaurant, told the paper: \"I said [to officers], 'Keep an eye on the three girls, maybe they'll give you a clue.'\" He also said he believed Sharmeena had been groomed by extremists who targeted her via social media on her phone. His daughter's behaviour changed after her mother died in January 2014 and she developed an intense interest in Islam, Mr Uddin told the newspaper. He said: \"I thought this was normal because she lost the closest person to her, and she's an only child. Before then she wasn't very religious. She wouldn't go to the mosque and she would wear English dress. \"But then she changed her dressing style and wore a scarf and started praying five times a day.\" Mr Uddin believes his daughter was groomed by two young women who took her to the airport and made sure she caught the flight to Turkey. She is thought to have been in the country for a few days before travelling on to Syria. The Daily Mail reported that two weeks after she left home, Sharmeena called her father to say: \"I'm in Islamic State and I'm not coming back.\" 'Uncharted territory' Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, said more needed to be done to find out what had convinced the girls to travel to Syria. \"I asked the Prime Minister for an inquiry into what happened here so that agencies, front line workers as well as families and the wider community can get the help they urgently need to protect young people. \"This is a relatively new phenomenon and uncharted territory for all of us. We need practical help for people working with young people.\" She added that the government needed to work together with the Turkish authorities to prevent people getting into Syria. 'Spy' arrest Shamima and Amira, who are both 15, and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana - all GCSE pupils at Bethnal Green Academy in east London - left their homes on 17 February. They flew to Istanbul from Gatwick with Turkish Airlines and are believed to have travelled to Syria within days. New video footage emerged on Friday apparently showing Amira, Shamima and Kadiza preparing to enter the country. The footage, broadcast by Turkish network A-Haber, seems to show a man helping the girls into a car near Turkey's border with Syria and appears to contain a reference to Syrian passports. It is believed to have been shot by a man later arrested for allegedly helping the trio to cross the border. Turkey's foreign minister has said the man is an intelligence worker. He worked for the intelligence agency of an unspecified country that is part of the coalition against IS, according to Mevlut Cavusoglu.",

    "text": "At the age of 92, Mr Mahathir defeated the Barisan Nasional coalition, which has been in power 60 years. He had come out of retirement to take on his former protege Najib Razak, who has been beset by allegations of corruption and cronyism. Mr Mahathir told reporters: \"We are not seeking revenge, we want to restore the rule of law\". The election commission said Mr Mahathir's opposition alliance had won 115 seats, over the threshold of 112 seats needed to form a government. He said he hoped a swearing-in ceremony would be held on Thursday. Mr Mahathir will become the oldest elected leader in the world. A government spokesman later declared nationwide public holidays for Thursday and Friday. With only a few seats left to count, official results showed Mr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan alliance, along with an ally in Sabah state, Borneo, had won 115 seats with BN on 79 seats. Opposition supporters poured on to the streets in celebration as the results became clear. The campaign pitted Mr Mahathir's opposition group against the BN, led by incumbent Prime Minister Najib Razak. The BN and its major party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), have dominated Malaysian politics since the country won independence from Britain in 1957, but the once-powerful coalition has seen its popularity decline in recent years. In the previous election, in 2013, the opposition made unprecedented gains, winning the popular vote, but it failed to win enough seats to form a government. In a dramatic turn of events, then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was sentenced to five years jail on sodomy charges, which he said were part of a political smear campaign. Mr Mahathir, who was once an integral part of BN and a mentor to Mr Najib, abandoned the coalition in 2016. As he left, he said he was \"embarrassed\" to be associated with a party \"that is seen as supporting corruption\". Mr Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal, which saw him accused of pocketing some $700m from the 1Malaysian Development Berhad, a state investment fund. He has vehemently denied all allegations and been cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund is still being investigated by several countries and Mr Najib has been accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials. The government recently passed a law redrawing election boundaries, leading to accusations that it had gerrymandered constituencies to ensure they were filled by Malay Muslims, who are traditionally BN supporters. In the days before the poll, election reform group Bersih 2.0 accused the Election Commission (EC) of multiple \"electoral crimes\", including irregularities in postal voting and failing to remove dead people from the electoral roll. A controversial fake news law was also recently introduced, which critics say could be used by the authorities to muffle dissent. Mr Mahathir is himself being investigated under that law after alleging that his plane had been sabotaged. The government had insisted the election would be free and fair, with Mr Najib saying that the EC acted \"for the good of all\". Voters were electing 222 members of parliament as well as state assembly members in 12 of the 13 states. Malaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where the party that gets the most seats in parliament wins even if it does not win the popular vote.",

India is looking to modernise its ageing Soviet-era military and the deal is the fruition of years of negotiation, with India intent on buying 126 jets in total for an estimated cost of $12bn (£8.2bn). Mr Modi announced the purchase of 36 Rafale jets from France last April. The two sides signed 13 agreements on Monday, including those on space co-operation, science and technology and the renovation of railway stations in India. The Reuters news agency quoted Mr Hollande as saying that the two sides also hoped to conclude agreement within a year on a French nuclear company building six nuclear reactors for India. The two leaders also discussed ways to increase security and intelligence co-operation. \"France and India are two great democracies... therefore we are prime targets for terrorists who cannot abide liberty, democracy or culture. We must therefore co-operate more on security,\" Mr Hollande said on Sunday. On Monday, the two leaders were to lay a foundation stone at the new headquarters of the International Solar Alliance, a 121-nation group launched by Mr Modi at the Paris climate summit in November to expand affordable solar power. Mr Hollande landed in the northern city of Chandigarh on Sunday where Mr Modi joined him at official engagements and lauded France's decision to invest $1bn every year in India in various sectors.",

    "text": "They have been charged with \"conspiracy to conduct an act in preparation for a terrorist act\", Federal Police said. The arrests are linked to a plot outlined in material seized last year as part of Operation Appleby. That operation, in September 2014, was sparked by intelligence reports that Islamist extremists were planning random killings in Australia. Then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at the time a senior Australian Islamic State militant had called for \"demonstration killings\", reportedly including a public beheading. Another three people, aged between 21 and 22, were also charged for the same offence on Thursday afternoon. All face potential life sentences if convicted. Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney: \"Continue to thwart attacks\" While its FA-18 fighters bomb so-called Islamic State targets many thousands of kilometres away, and its soldiers train Iraqi forces, Australia continues to confront the enemy within. More counter-terrorism raids in Sydney have yielded further arrests, and will make an uneasy nation even more anxious on the eve of the first anniversary of the deadly Sydney siege. Last month, a poll found that more than half of Australians thought a large-scale attack was likely, and one-quarter was convinced it was inevitable. The prime minister has promised a \"calm, clinical and effective\" response to the menace of home-grown extremism. \"We cannot eliminate entirely the risk of terrorism any more than we can eliminate the risk of any serious crime,\" said Malcolm Turnbull in his first national security address. \"But we can mitigate it. We will continue to thwart and frustrate many attacks before they occur.\" Timeline of recent Australia terror incidents At least 800 heavily armed officers arrested 16 people as part of Operation Appleby in September 2014, in what was Australia's biggest ever anti-terror operation. Police said the arrests on Thursday were not linked to a new plot, but to documents seized during those raids that talked about a plan to target government and police buildings. \"As a result of putting all of that information together, working through those documents, putting physical and electronic surveillance together, we were able to build a case of conspiracy for five people involved in the preparation of these documents,\" said Deputy Commissioner of National Security Michael Phelan. Those arrested on Thursday are also known to those involved in the terror-linked shooting of Sydney police worker Curtis Cheng, police said. Mr Cheng, 58, was shot dead outside his police headquarters office as he left work last October. Police shot dead his attacker, 15-year-old Farhad Jabar, at the scene. New South Wales Police said the 15-year-old boy arrested on Thursday was charged based on activity when he was 14. They added that he had clearly been radicalised, although they did not yet know how it had happened. \"It is disturbing that we continue to deal with teenaged children in this environment,\" said Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn. \"To be putting a 15-year-old before the courts on very serious charges that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment demonstrates the difficulties law enforcement face.\" Police said a total of 11 people had now been charged under Operation Appleby.",

    "text": "By Aparna AlluriBBC News, Delhi The Australian newspaper re-published the story with a scathing summary: \"Arrogance, hyper-nationalism and bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis of epic proportions, critics say, as India's crowd-loving PM basks while citizens literally suffocate.\" It earned a rebuke from India, but there's no denying the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cherished image has taken a bad hit. Stories from India's punishing second wave have dominated global news and social media feeds - people gasping to stay alive as they wait for critical care beds and treatment; desperate families scrambling for everything, from oxygen cylinders to a doctor's appointment; mass funeral pyres and parking lots turning into crematoriums to accommodate the rising number of dead. Coverage the world over has pinned the blame on Mr Modi - a man who has often presented himself as an able administrator with an eye for detail, who is now floundering as India's daily cases break records. 'A crack in the facade' \"If competence was his calling card, many people are calling that into question,\" political scientist Milan Vaishnav says. \"It's not just that the government seems to be fumbling or absent, it's that they actively contributed to exacerbating the situation.\" Mr Modi is far from being the only leader to have bungled his Covid response. But his fall from grace is so pronounced, Mr Vaishnav says, because, unlike former US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, he was not a \"Covid denier\". And yet he failed to prevent what happened, despite the warning signs. Mr Modi allowed a Hindu festival where millions gathered on the banks of the Ganges river over several weeks for a holy dip. He insisted on a month-long election in West Bengal state and campaigned unmasked at massive rallies, marvelling at the size the crowds. \"These displays of negligence or defiance were shocking to see from parts of the world which had seen lockdowns recently,\" says Alex Travelli, The Economist's India correspondent. They were also a vivid reminder of Mr Modi's brand - a strong, popular leader of an overwhelmingly Hindu country - and the Indian exceptionalism that he touted to the world in January. \"For foreign observers, his nationalist impulses were always paired with a sense of technocratic competence. But technocratic competence has been entirely missing from the [Covid] response,\" says Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York. Mr Modi's reputation as a both a populist leader and a vigilant administrator started to fray in 2016 when a disastrous currency ban knocked down millions of Indians who largely relied on cash. Then, last year, he shut down the country overnight to stop the spread of Covid - but again, millions lost jobs and many lost their lives. India's economy is still reeling from all of this. Mr Modi's defence was that there was a greater good at stake, be it flushing out illegal cash or beating Covid. But this latest misstep cannot be explained away easily, says Ravi Agrawal, editor-in-chief of Foreign Policy. \"You can explain away numbers like GDP, but you can't explain away a brother's death,\" he says. \"Indians have always believed that although Modi makes mistakes, he still fights for them, he believes in them.\" But this time, he says, they are questioning his intent. \"There is a crack, a very visible crack in the edifice, the facade that is Modi.\" The making - and unmaking - of a brand \"Modi means business\" declared a Time magazine cover in 2012. Back in 2002, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in riots that erupted in Gujarat state after 60 Hindus were killed in a train fire. Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the state, was accused of allowing the riots. He denied any wrongdoing and came out unscathed. By 2012, the Gujarat chief minister was \"a paragon of good governance and effective administration\" for his supporters. Other coverage dubbed him an \"autocratic loner\" and \"a poor delegator\", but a \"refreshing\" change under whom \"Gujarat bloomed\" and \"business flourished\". His bid for PM, after a 13-year stint heading Gujarat, was seen as an opportunity to \"revitalise\" India's economy. The BJP was taking a risk on the \"polarising\" Mr Modi, but his reputation as a \"no-nonsense administrator\" was part of his appeal. \"We got taken in by the relatively easy way it was to govern Gujarat,\" says Nilanjan Mukopadhyay, a journalist and Mr Modi's biographer. Brand new roads, power lines, lesser red tape and increased private investment in Gujarat impressed middle-class and wealthy voters. But Mr Mukhopadhyay says it wasn't a great feat to achieve in a prosperous state with a small population. And Gujarat's social indicators didn't improve much. \"We were all taken by this great aura of Modi. I made this error too. He once said we have a red carpet, not red tape. Where is the red carpet for the aid that is coming?\" (The aid has been stuck in customs, according to a series of damaging news reports.) The current crisis, observers say, has exposed the chinks in Mr Modi's armour. They say his centralised style of leadership seemed reassuring last year but proved hollow this time as he passed the buck to states. A generous vaccine strategy, which saw him donate doses to countries, now appears like careless grandstanding since India has forced its largest vaccine marker to renege on international commitments, which brought it funding. His strident majoritarianism, which so many voters admired, stops him from reaching out across the aisle for bipartisan solutions, experts say. \"He put his name and his stamp on everything. So when something goes wrong he has to take the fall. You can't have it both ways,\" Mr Agrawal says. Mr Modi built an impressive brand abroad too - \"He is at his best outside India,\" wrote one newspaper. He drew a \"roaring crowd\" at the iconic Madison Square Gardens and overshadowed former US President Donald Trump at the Howdy, Modi! gathering in Texas. \"He deployed this imagery of himself so aggressively,\" Mr Agrawal says. He was even called the \"most physically demonstrative Indian leader in years.\" His muscular nationalism was a balm for Indians at home and overseas, and promised the emergence of a superpower. Now, Mr Agrawal says, it is \"galling\" for Indians everywhere to see how their economic peers - Thailand, Vietnam, Bangladesh - have fared better against Covid. \"There's embarrassment among the diaspora that the country which they have got used to describing to their friends as a rising power is now being shown the way it is.\" Can Modi's image recover? \"He has proven to be an exceptionally resilient politician and political leader,\" Mr Vaishnav says. \"The man has recovered from some incredible nadirs already, I wouldn't count him out,\" Mr Travelli adds. The government is already in damage-control mode. It has taken offence to the bad press, sparred with opposition leaders and fumed at tweeters critical of its response. It has suggested a \"foreign conspiracy\" is afoot to discredit India, asked Twitter to take down posts it didn't like and then took to Twitter to thank and defend Mr Modi's leadership. But Mr Modi himself has been conspicuously absent, barring a tame address on 20 April. \"At the start of the pandemic, Modi knew how he wanted to look to India and the world,\" Mr Travelli says. \"He was styling himself as a general leading his people. But no equivalent posture is available to him at the moment. He doesn't have any interest in apologising or asking for help.\" Mr Modi has only been interviewed a handful of times since he became PM. He has never addressed a press conference, even during Covid. \"He doesn't want to be questioned,\" Mr Mukhopadhyay says. But questions are all anyone has - the poor, a traumatised middle class and the rich Indians who couldn't escape the huge gaps in healthcare, and even loyal party workers who can't quite grasp how the prime minister let this happen.

    "text": "Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving. The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high. Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been \"cynical\" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK was part of the EU. Speaking to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Conservative MP and former London Mayor said it was \"cynical and unacceptable to say you can fulfil that pledge\". \"I think that they (the figures) show the scandal of the promise made by politicians repeatedly that they could cut immigration to the tens of thousands and then to throw their hands up in the air and say there's nothing we can do because Brussels has taken away our control of immigration,\" he said. Mr Johnson, a leading figure in the campaign to get Britain out of the EU in June's referendum, said he was pro-immigration but there was \"no public consent for the scale of immigration we are seeing\" and the situation was \"completely out of control\". He said that the only solution was to leave the EU, saying that a vote to stay in the union would mean people \"kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration\". Laura Kuenssberg said the immigration figures \"could hardly have come at a more sensitive time, just when the referendum campaign is moving into a more brutal and frantic phase\". Home Office minister James Brokenshire said David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU, which will see restrictions placed on the benefits new arrivals can claim and a crackdown on \"sham marriages\", would \"close back-door routes\" into the country. \"Leaving the EU is absolutely no panacea or silver bullet,\" he added, telling BBC News that net migration from outside the EU was higher than from within it and leaving would \"wreck the economy and harm jobs\". In other developments, with four weeks to go before the UK votes on 23 June on whether to stay in or leave the EU: According to the Office for National Statistics, there was a 20,000 rise in net migration to the UK from the 313,000 for the year to December 2014. The figure is well above the government's aim of getting it to the \"tens of thousands\" and is the highest recorded for a calendar year. A Downing Street spokesman declined to say whether Mr Cameron remained committed to that target but said the government would \"continue to look at what more might be done\". The spokesman added: \"Of course people rightly have concerns on immigration but the PM's view is very clearly that wrecking the economy and destroying jobs by getting rid of our privileged access to the world's biggest market is not the answer.\" He said the Leave campaign failed to spell out what would happen to migration if the UK left the EU, with some saying \"they will cut migration while telling other groups that they will keep freedom of movement or increase visas\". Thursday's figures show estimated levels of long-term migration into the UK from within the EU and outside in the year to December 2015. They show that 270,000 EU citizens moved to the UK for at least a year in 2015, up from 264,000 in 2014. The number of non-EU citizens moving to the UK was 277,000, down from 287,000 in 2014. The rise in the net figure was the result of a fall in the numbers of people emigrating. Analysis By Home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The net migration figure is just short of the record but that statistic alone doesn't do justice to the global picture and the UK's place in it. Everywhere you look, people are on the move - coming and going depending on economic and political circumstances. EU immigration is relatively stable - although there are more southern Europeans than before thanks to the Eurozone's economic doldrums. One really interesting figure, that doesn't affect the population headcount - officially at least - is the 110,000 rise in short-term immigration to about 1.2m. More people are coming for less than a year - such as short contract workers selected by employers who are looking internationally for the best people at the most competitive price. But it will also include some Brits who spend part of the year here - and the rest living in the sun. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the numbers show \"mass immigration is still hopelessly out of control and set to get worse if we Remain inside the EU, going on with disastrous open borders\". But former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett warned that an agreement with France to allow British border controls at Calais and the Eurostar terminals in Paris and Brussels would be at risk if Britain left the EU. He criticised Leave campaigners for wanting to create a \"fortress Britain\" - and defended the last Labour government's record immigration, saying \"We didn't just simply say to Poles coming in back in 2004, just come here, we said we'd rather you come here and work than be in the sub-economy.\" He added: \"40% of those who registered to work back in 2004 were already in the country and the reason I make that point is because a lot of people would come in illegally if we didn't have the border controls on French soil.\" The Institute of Directors said the public was \"being very poorly served by the current level of the debate on immigration\" and people came to work in the UK because it is one of \"best performing economies in Europe\". \"Employment is at a record high, and there are big skills gaps that employers cannot fill domestically. Despite the overblown rhetoric that today's figures have sparked, the actual numbers have not changed much in the last year,\" said IoD employment spokesman Seamus Nevin.

    "text": "By Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service Scientists say they have contributed to the extinction of nearly one dozen wild bird and animal species. As such, they have become the third worst human-introduced predators after cats and rats. Now dogs are said to threaten nearly 200 species worldwide, some of which are critically endangered, studies suggest. And yet, feral and free-ranging dogs have received surprisingly little attention, conservationists say. In a recent study carried out on dogs in Chile, the authors said: \"Conservationists in Chile and elsewhere see urgency in controlling the impact of free-ranging dogs on wildlife.\" It found dog owners were not concerned about the issue and many allowed their pets to move freely in the wild. \"Predation and harassment by dogs has been documented for the majority of larger terrestrial mammals that inhabit Chile, including the three species of canids (mammals from the dog family) and three species of deer,\" Eduardo Silva-Rodriguez, one of the authors of the study, told the BBC. One billion dogs There are an estimated one billion domestic dogs worldwide and their conditions range from feral and free-ranging to entirely dependent on humans. There is no definitive figure for feral and free-ranging dogs, but conservationists say their number is definitely rising. \"It's quite a matter of serious concern,\" Piero Genovesi, head of the invasive species specialist unit at the IUCN conservation body, told the BBC. \"As the human population rises, so will the number of dogs, and this problem could get worse.\" Dogged species Of the around 200 species said to be threatened by feral and free-ranging dogs, 30 are classed as critically endangered, 71 endangered, and 87 vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of at-risk species. Nearly half of these species are mammals, 78 of them are birds, 22 reptiles and three amphibians. The most affected regions are parts of Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean and parts of Oceania, according to a study published in Biological Conservation. Experts say abandoned dogs and those that are allowed to roam freely are the real problems. Many impacts They are said to affect wildlife in five general ways. They become predators and kill wild animals, disturb the ecosystem, transmit diseases to wildlife, compete with them for prey, and also interbreed with closely related species. \"Through our camera traps we have found that dogs enter caves where lynx take the prey animals they have killed, and we have footage showing dogs eating the carcasses,\" said Izabela Wierzbowska, a scientist at the Jagiellonian University in Poland. \"We have also noticed that the lynx gets very disturbed when it finds out that there was another predator in the cave feeding on its prey.\" Studies have shown that dogs contributed to the extinction of at least eight species of birds, including the New Zealand quail. Pictures of feral dogs hounding and killing endangered species in different parts of the world have also emerged on social media. Hounded Among the most striking ones are a snow leopard hounded by three feral dogs in Tibet and a polar bear surrounded by three free-ranging dogs. In Chile, nearly 70% of pudu, the world's tiniest deer, that were brought to rehabilitation centres were attacked by dogs, according to a study published in the scientific journal Oryx. A study in more than 30 national parks of Brazil found that 37 native species were affected by the presence of domestic dogs. In India's Rajasthan state, less than 100 great Indian bustards, an endangered species, remain and even they are being threatened by dogs. \"This problem has been going on and growing in the Indian Himalayan region for more than 10 years now,\" says Abi Vanak an invasive species expert, who has authored a number of reports on the issue. He is now studying how far dogs get into tiger reserves in India. Dogs and diseases Some experts say that wildlife in many parts of the world have been hit by the transfer of diseases from dogs - and this is much the more significant problem. \"Direct poaching by dogs is less of a threat, but the main issue is the spread of diseases from dogs to wild animals, notably rabies and canine distemper,\" said Arnulf Koehncke, director of species conservation with WWF in Germany. \"There have been repeated outbreaks of these diseases among critically endangered Ethiopian wolves, for instance, as well as of rabies in India and Nepal.\" Wolf problem In Europe, experts say, the problem is a bit different. They are worried that feral and free ranging dogs are interbreeding with wolves. \"And that poses a threat to wolves,\" says Moritz Klose, from WWF. \"If this continues to grow, we will lose the purity of our wolves' genes.\" Killing controversy Killing of feral and free-ranging dogs as a solution has been quite controversial and has been banned in several countries. \"Killing campaigns to reduce or eliminate dog populations is not only inhumane but ineffective, creating a population vacuum that is quickly filled by an influx of new dogs from other areas,\" says Kelly O'Meara, Humane Society International's Vice President of Companion Animals. \"The key to addressing conflicts in an effective and sustainable way is to gradually reduce the dog population through humane dog management programmes, involving the spaying and neutering of dogs to curb the overall numbers, and then mass vaccination to ensure the population is healthy and disease free.\" Conservationists say that although several studies have demonstrated the problem exists, there has been no comprehensive proposal looking at solutions. Unless that happens - and with populations of humans and dogs on the rise - wildlife will likely continue to be threatened.",

    "text": "Official results showed Mr Rajapaksa, 70, took 52.25% of the vote. His rival Sajith Premadasa had already conceded. Mr Rajapaksa was the clear victor in Sinhalese majority areas while Mr Premadasa scored better in the Tamil-dominated north. The election is Sri Lanka's first since the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Militants linked to the Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island in April, killing more than 250 people. As a result, national security was seen as a dominant issue ahead of the vote. Mr Rajapaksa, who has positioned himself as a strong figure who can assure Sri Lankans' security, is a highly controversial figure among the country's more than two million Tamils. He and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president, spearheaded the defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a decades-long war in which at least 100,000 people died. Several journalists who were critics of the government when the Rajapaksas led Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 were abducted, tortured and killed. Thousands of people, particularly Tamils, vanished in what have been described as enforced disappearances. Earlier this year, Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC that war crimes allegations against him were \"baseless\" Votes appeared to be starkly divided between the Sinhala Buddhist majority and minority Tamil, Hindu and Muslim groups, raising fears about the future of reconciliation in a country that remains heavily polarised along ethnic and religious lines a decade after the end of the bitter war. After his election win, Mr Rajapaksa made a call for unity in the country. \"It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without racial or religious discrimination,\" he said. \"I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner.\" Human rights groups expressed concern about accountability for wartime abuses - which were committed by both sides - given the election of a man so closely associated with the end of the conflict. Mr Premadasa, who took 42% of the vote, publicly conceded when partial results showed Mr Rajapaksa was certain to emerge the winner. \"It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh president of Sri Lanka,\" Mr Premadasa said. Turnout was 83.7%, the election commission said. Mr Rajapaksa is due to be sworn in at a ceremony on Monday. Unity and reconciliation will not be easy By Jill McGivering, BBC News, Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa commands passionate support among many in the Buddhist Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka. He and Mahinda, who was president here for 10 years, are credited with bringing an end to the country's long civil war. \"I think it's a turning point in the history of Sri Lanka,\" said a Rajapaksa supporter, lawyer Janaka Arunashantha. \"With economy and national security, I think the country will improve in every way in the next five years. We're very hopeful with him.\" Sri Lanka is still in shock, seven months after the bomb attacks by a cell of Islamist militants which devastated the island's economy, blew apart the island's fragile communal relations and was the final blow to public confidence in a government already tarnished by infighting. But the news will be greeted with quiet dismay by many in the minority communities who voted overwhelmingly not for Mr Rajapaksa but his rival, Sajith Premadasa. They see him as a more liberal, inclusive choice. Unifying the different communities - and pursuing post-war reconciliation - will be a daunting task. Read more from Jill The Easter Sunday attacks cast a long shadow over the election. The government was forced to admit it had suffered a \"major intelligence lapse\" after failing to adequately share information from Indian intelligence officials about a potential attack. But since the attacks, Muslims - who make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people - say they have faced a more overt campaign of hate against them, fuelled by hardline Buddhist groups. Muslim shop owners say they have been boycotted and there have been outbreaks of mob violence. More about Sri Lanka and the Easter Sunday bombings A total of 35 candidates stood in the presidential election, the third since the end of the civil war. The country's incumbent president, Maithripala Sirisena, was not on the ballot. He decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. Ruling party candidate Mr Premadasa focused on social issues as well as security - campaigning on a promise to eradicate poverty and improve housing. He is the son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993 and is the current housing minister. The previous Rajapaksa era was marked by close ties between Sri Lanka and China, with the latter investing billions in infrastructure and development on the island. However the island's ballooning debt to Beijing worried many Sri Lankans. Regional powers including India expressed concern about the extent of Chinese influence in the country. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he planned to \"restore relations\" with China, if he won the election. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.",

    "text": "He was part of the Kapoor acting dynasty which has long dominated Bollywood, the Hindi film industry. The actor made a huge splash in 1973 with his first lead role in Bobby - a teenage love story. He played the romantic lead in dozens of films for over two decades, after which he made a successful transition to character roles. Rishi Kapoor debuted as a child actor in 1970 in his father Raj Kapoor's film, Mera Naam Joker. Several of his films in the 1980s and 90s - Khel Khel Mein, Karz and Chandni - became massive box office hits. He was a skilful dancer and some of his films had songs that are massively popular even today. Kapoor made a successful on-screen pair with actress Neetu Singh. In one of Bollywood's most enduring love stories, they took that romance off-screen as well when they got married in 1980. Their son, Ranbir Kapoor, is a successful Bollywood star in his own right. Rishi Kapoor also worked in several multi-starrers with Amitabh Bachchan and his uncle Shashi Kapoor. He had a second coming in this decade, doing character roles and appearing in some interesting cameos in small films. One generation of the Kapoor family was born in the city of Peshawar in Pakistan. The family migrated to India after the partition in 1947. In 1990, Rishi Kapoor visited a residential building in Peshawar called Kapoor Haveli where his grandfather, Prithviraj and his father Raj Kapoor, were born. The news he had lost his battle with cancer came a day after the death of Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan. Kapoor was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018 and returned to India last September after a year-long course of treatment in New York. He was taken to hospital on Wednesday morning after he complained of breathing difficulties, his brother Randhir Kapoor told the Press Trust of India. The actor's family confirmed his death in a message saying his life had ended peacefully. \"The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last. He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him. \"He was grateful for the love of his fans that poured in from the world over. In his passing, they would all understand that he would like to be remembered with a smile and not with tears.\" The family also appealed to his fans and friends to follow restrictions around gathering in public because of the lockdown over coronavirus and respect the laws that are in force. Meanwhile, tributes have been pouring in for Kapoor from his fellow Bollywood actors and politicians on social media. Amitabh Bachchan who worked in several hit films with Kapoor tweeted: \"He's GONE .. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone .. just passed away .. I am destroyed !\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as \"multifaceted, endearing and lively\" and \"a powerhouse of talent\". \"I will always recall our interactions, even on social media. He was passionate about films and India's progress. Anguished by his demise,\" he tweeted. Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi also tweeted about his death: \"This is a terrible week for Indian cinema, with the passing of another legend, actor Rishi Kapoor. A wonderful actor, with a huge fan following across generations, he will be greatly missed.\" News of his death has also seen an outpouring of sadness on social media in Pakistan. Former fast bowler Waqar Younis was among those who tweeted their condolences. There was particular sadness in the city of Peshawar, where the Kapoor family used to live before the Partition of British India in 1947. Candles were lit there for Rishi's uncle Shashi Kapoor, another Bollywood star, when he died in 2017. Such a tribute for Rishi Kapoor may not happen, owing to Covid-19 restrictions. \"But Peshawar will dearly miss Rishi,\" the city's Cultural Heritage Council secretary Shakil Waheedullah told the BBC. He was received at the actor's residence in 2009 on the first of two trips he made to Mumbai. \"He really made me feel at home.\" Kapoor was prolific on social media, frequently commenting on controversial issues. His last tweet was an appeal to people not to attack medical staff at the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus saying, \"we have to win this war together\".",

    "text": "Whitehall sources said it was possible to strip the 19-year-old of British nationality as she was eligible for citizenship of another country. Her family's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said they were \"disappointed\" with the decision and were considering \"all legal avenues\" to challenge it. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, had said she wanted to return home. She was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold - and gave birth to a son at the weekend. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, Ms Begum said she never sought to be an IS \"poster girl\" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. ITV News obtained the letter sent to Ms Begum's mother, asking her to inform her daughter of the decision. Bangladesh link Under the 1981 British Nationality Act, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be \"conducive to the public good\" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum said she travelled to Syria with her sister's UK passport but it was taken from her when she crossed the border. She is believed to be of Bangladeshi heritage but when asked by the BBC, she said did not have a Bangladesh passport and had never been to the country. On the question of Ms Begum's son, a child born to a British parent before they are deprived of their citizenship would still be considered British. While it would theoretically be possible for the UK to then remove citizenship from the child, officials would need to balance their rights against any potential threat they posed. A Home Office spokesman said: \"In recent days the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here.\" He said the department did not comment on individual cases but decisions to remove citizenship were \"based on all available evidence and not taken lightly\". Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that if Ms Begum's mother was a Bangladeshi national - as is believed to be the case - under Bangladesh law Ms Begum would be too. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, said they were \"very surprised\" by what seemed to be a \"kneejerk reaction\" by the Home Office. Stressing that Ms Begum had never been to Bangladesh, Mr Babu said: \"It seems to be a bizarre decision and I'm not entirely sure how that will stand up legally.\" Conservative MP George Freeman said the move was a \"mistake\" that would set a \"dangerous precedent\". Liberal Democrats MP Ed Davey said Ms Begum should be allowed to return to the UK. He said: \"Membership of a terrorist group is a serious crime, as is encouraging or supporting terrorism, but Shamima Begum should face justice for those crimes in the UK.\" Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but between 1,000 and 1,500 militants are believed to be left in a 50 sq km (20 sq mile) near Syria's border with Iraq. Mr Javid told MPs earlier this week that more than 100 dual nationals had already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. Last year, two British men, accused of being members of an IS cell dubbed \"The Beatles\" were stripped of their citizenship after being captured in Syria. 'Retaliation' Ms Begum has said she does not regret travelling to Syria, however, she said she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She told the BBC she was \"shocked\" by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack - which killed 22 people and was claimed by IS - but she also compared it to military assaults on IS strongholds, saying it was \"retaliation\". Robbie Potter, who was seriously injured in the attack while he waited for his children in the foyer of Manchester Arena, said he felt \"angry\" and sickened by Ms Begum's comments. Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in February 2015. Ms Sultana is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Ms Abase is unknown. Ms Begum gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. Ms Begum has the right to appeal the Home Office's decision.",

    "text": "By Chris EwokorBBC Africa, Abuja Mannir Awal Addo, a trader in Abuja who has family that he visits every weekend in Kaduna, was kidnapped on the Abuja-Kaduna highway earlier this year and held for five days. He told the BBC that he paid his abductors $1,300 (£1,000) for his freedom: \"It was a traumatic experience.\" He was affected by polio as a child and said he could not run away when kidnappers attacked the vehicle he was travelling in. \"Since then, honestly I don't use car transport because I am afraid of the road. It's better for me to take the train because of its safety.\" By road the 150km (93-mile) journey between the two cities is cheaper and shorter, but it has become a matter of life and death as dozens of travellers are kidnapped along the highway - and many are killed. When, thanks to a $500m Chinese loan, the train line linking Abuja to Kaduna opened in 2016 people used it more for its novelty value, given that most the country's railway system is a relic from the colonial era. Brawling for tickets But now it is hard to get a ticket for the four round-trips made each day, with 5,000 commuters packing on to them daily. The demand is high because nine armed police officers are on board guarding the train's six carriages. A one-way ticket is sold for about $4 for economy and $8 for business class - and there are usually long queues to get them. Many passengers miss scheduled trips because of the huge demand. Many of the civil servants who work in the capital live in Kaduna. In August, users posted images of stranded passengers brawling over tickets at a train station. Officials have also been accused of hoarding tickets and selling them at inflated rates in a racketeering scheme, prompting the government to say it is considering automating the process. Those who have tickets but cannot find seats have the option of standing for the two-hour journey for the same fee. You may also be interested in: When I joined 600 passengers on the 09:45 from Abuja, more than 50 were standing in my carriage. Others were squeezed into the spaces between the carriages and by the toilets. It is a choice many are happy to make rather than use what has been dubbed Nigeria's most dangerous road. The highway is bordered on each side by thick rows of neem and baobab trees, providing excellent cover for the armed gangs hiding in wait. Kidnappers in Nigeria are not fussy. They abduct both rich and poor, often collecting ransoms of up to $150,000 and as low as $20 - sometimes killing those whose families fail to pay. \"At its height, the road had 10 kidnappings per day with 20 different groups operating on the route,\" says police commander Abba Kyari, who heads a special unit fighting kidnappers. The true figures are likely to be higher, as some families, like that of Mr Addo, choose not to report to officials, deciding to negotiate with the kidnappers directly. Train passenger and postgraduate student Idris Mohammed, who used to travel by road to Kaduna for the weekends, is happy to pay more for his safety as \"the roads are too dangerous now\". Why don't people live in Abuja? For most of the civil servants who work in the capital annual rents as high as $15,000 are just too expensive. Many live to the north in Kaduna, the commercial hub of northern Nigeria, where housing is cheaper. A cosmopolitan city, Kaduna is very different to Abuja, bristling with divergent interests, but with simmering tensions over ethnic, political and religious issues. By contrast, Abuja is a slow-paced, administrative city. It became Nigeria's capital in 1991 and has grown up from a small village to become home to many diplomats and foreign NGO workers. It was chosen as the capital because of its central location - which means that many people come from elsewhere in the country to work there, so on weekends it really empties out. And its fairly well-heeled daily and weekly commuters are prime targets for kidnappers. Bus stations suffering But the popularity of the trains is bad news for buses. Despite buses charging at least six times less than the trains, many of the big bus stations, which used to be bustling with passengers and luggage, are now empty. An official from the transporters' union told me the safety the trains could provide was the main reason. Many of those who still use the road do so in private cars and set off at mid-morning or early afternoon. Those who travel later place their faith in the several police check-points along the road to try to deter kidnappers. Though the police have recorded a few successes against the kidnappers, including the 2017 arrest in south-west Lagos of an alleged kidnap kingpin, some people still question the seriousness of security agencies in tackling the problem. For now the train is a welcome haven - and the only recent security issue has been over cattle. In September last year, the armed police escorts fired live rounds into the air to disperse villagers on the outskirts of Kaduna who had gathered to attack a train after 50 cows were crushed crossing the track. The train journeys have also become a meeting point for Nigeria's rich and poor and they sometimes bring together those from feuding communities - now all fleeing one common enemy, kidnappers. When my train finally arrived at Rigasa station in Kaduna, some passengers raised their arms and murmured a prayer: they had lived to die another day.",

    "text": "His family have not heard from him since he left Interpol HQ in the French city of Lyon for a trip back to China on 25 September, officials said. \"He did not disappear in France,\" a source close to the inquiry told AFP. The South China Morning Post quotes a source as saying Mr Meng, 64, was \"taken away\" for questioning in China. It is not clear why he was being investigated by \"discipline authorities\" or where he was being held, the Hong Kong-based newspaper adds. Officials in China have so far made no public comments on Mr Meng, a senior Communist Party official there. What is the French investigation looking at? It was opened after Mr Meng's wife went to police to report her husband missing. She was initially quoted by police sources as saying she has not heard from him since his departure on 29 September. But the French interior ministry later said the correct date was 25 September. \"Exchanges with Chinese authorities continue,\" the ministry said. \"France is puzzled about the situation of Interpol's president and concerned about the threats made to his wife.\" It did not provide any further details. Has Meng Hongwei angered China? Analysis by BBC Asia Editor Celia Hatton Meng Hongwei's disappearance seems to fit in with a now familiar pattern among China's senior Communist Party officials. The official in question suddenly drops out of the public eye and an alarm is raised that the person is \"missing\", usually by members of the public. Eventually, the party issues a terse statement that the official is \"under investigation\", the official is then booted from the party for \"disciplinary infractions\" and - eventually - a prison sentence is announced. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, well over a million party officials have been disciplined in some way. Mr Meng's case is notable for a few reasons. First, his wife notified the French authorities after he had only been missing for a few days. Family members of missing party officials rarely, if ever, reach out to foreign authorities, in fear their relatives will face ever greater punishment. Did the wife do this because she felt there was no other option? Also, at one time, China prized Mr Meng's lofty position at Interpol. If he has really gone missing within the Chinese state apparatus, whom did he anger, or what could he have done for Beijing to willingly, and publicly, forfeit the top job at Interpol? How has Interpol reacted? In a statement, the organisation said it was aware of reports of the \"alleged disappearance\" of Mr Meng. \"This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China,\" it said. Interpol added that the secretary general - not the president - was in charge of the day-to-day running of the 192-member organisation. As president, Mr Meng leads the Executive Committee, which provides the overall guidance and direction to Interpol. Mr Meng's term is scheduled to run until 2020. Before taking over at Interpol, Meng Hongwei was deputy minister in charge of public security in China. After his election human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country. Meng Hongwei Mr Meng said at the time that he was ready to do \"everything he could towards the cause of policing in the world\". Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control, according to Interpol. Interpol can issue a red notice - an international alert - for a wanted person. But it does not have the power to send officers into countries to arrest individuals or issue arrest warrants.",

    "text": "By Steve RosenbergBBC News, Moscow Communist Russia reckoned that in five years, you could transform an economy. Vladimir Putin's Russia has updated the idea. Over the last five years it's not the economy the Kremlin has been expanding: it's Moscow's geo-political clout. Think back to 2014. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine, Moscow - slapped with Western sanctions - looked isolated, a pariah state. Western leaders queued up to criticise President Putin, confident that pressure on the Kremlin would change its behaviour. President Barack Obama dismissed Russia as a \"regional power\". For a former superpower, that hurt. Fast forward to 2019. Today, Russia is pushing for global influence. It interfered in America's presidential election on the side of Donald Trump, according to US intelligence; it's seeking to boost its role in Africa and Latin America; and it's also exploiting divisions within Europe. Mediator in the Middle East In the Middle East, the transformation is stark. Four years after Moscow launched its military operation in Syria, Russia is replacing America as the key player and power broker in the region. In the space of just a few days, Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to the Turkish president and invited him to Moscow; he had a phone call with the Israeli prime minister where they discussed \"security issues\"; he visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It is a sign of Russia's increasing active role in the Middle East. This is how popular Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets views the change: \"The current situation in the Middle East would have been unthinkable in the days of Henry Kissinger and his idea of 'global geopolitical chess'. The oversized giant by the name of America lost its way in broad daylight… while Russian diplomacy is ahead of the game. \"Russia plays the role of the universal mediator and political broker, and none of the regional powers can ignore it.\" In Moscow, Donald Trump's decision to pull US troops away from the Syrian-Turkish border took foreign policy experts by surprise. \"There is a deep belief here that Americans are smart,\" says Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign policy analyst close to the Kremlin. \"And that if Americans do something stupid, it's not because it's stupid, but because we don't completely understand their grand design. \"For many Russians it's difficult to believe Americans might do completely crazy things. But it turns out that they can.\" Syria: Why Russia wins There are several ways in which Moscow benefits from the current situation in north-eastern Syria: When Moscow launched its military operation in Syria in 2015, the Kremlin claimed its priority was defeating international terrorism. But rebuilding Russia's influence in the Middle East was a major consideration. From its naval base in Tartus, Russia can project military power across the Mediterranean. Recent reports suggest Moscow is expanding its air base near Latakia. Balance of power changing? Russia's increasing assertiveness on the world stage has coincided with a period of political introspection in the West. \"The US and European powers are much more inward-looking than a couple of years ago,\" Fyodor Lukyanov believes. \"What we see are Russian opponents, who tried to isolate Russia, in a state of considerable flux. In contrast, Russia demonstrated a high degree of resilience to outside pressure and skilful behaviour in the Middle East.\" Resilience and skill - certainly. Enhanced influence - for sure. But for a resurgent Russia, there are potential pitfalls. This country is no economic superpower. Russia's economy is fragile and further stagnation may limit Moscow's global ambitions. As for the Middle East, the region is complex, torn by division, mistrust and hatred. Russia may have emerged as the power broker. But it faces a daunting diplomatic balancing act if it to use its influence to restore peace.",

    "text": "Two of the men were among the kingdom's most influential figures. The detentions are seen as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightening his grip on power. In 2017 dozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen were confined to Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel after the crown prince ordered their arrests. Mohammed bin Salman, a controversial figure, has been considered the de facto ruler of the kingdom after he was named crown prince by his father in 2016. The detentions were first revealed by the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which said they took place early on Friday. The three men arrested are the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and a royal cousin, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef. Mohammed bin Nayef was interior minister until he was removed from his role and placed under house arrest by Mohammed Bin Salman in 2017. In his previous role, he was seen as a close and trusted partner by US intelligence officials. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 78, is the king's only surviving full brother. In 2018 he made comments seen as critical of the crown prince to protesters in London but later said he had been misinterpreted. Both men were seen as potential rivals to the 34-year-old crown prince, who is first in line for the throne. Guards arrived at the homes of the royals wearing masks and dressed in black, and searched the properties, the Wall Street Journal says. This is a significant move by Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate his position. Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz is one of the last surviving sons of the country's founder, King Abdelaziz, and widely respected amongst older members of the ruling family. The other senior prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, was next in line to the throne before he was suddenly replaced three years ago. Before that, as interior minister, he was credited with defeating the al-Qaeda insurgency that gripped Saudi Arabia in the 2000s. There has been no immediate official confirmation or denial of the story published in the US media but palace affairs in Saudi Arabia are often shrouded in secrecy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman won international praise in 2016 when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018. He has also been criticised over the continuing conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia backs pro-government forces, and the harsh treatment of women's rights activists. despite the lifting of some restrictions including the right to drive. In recent days Saudi Arabia has been taking measures to contain the spread of the deadly new coronavirus.

    "text": "China's space agency said the station will re-enter the atmosphere in the next 24 hours - in line with European Space Agency (ESA) predictions. The Tiangong-1 was part of China's ambitious space programme, and the prototype for a manned station in 2022. It entered orbit in 2011 and five years later ended its mission, after which it was expected to fall back to Earth. The latest projection from the Esa points to re-entry at 07:25 Beijing time (00:25 GMT) on 2 April, although the window is still \"highly variable\" - stretching from Sunday afternoon to Monday morning. Most of the station is likely to burn up in the atmosphere but some debris could survive to hit the surface of the Earth. The China Manned Space Engineering Office said on social media that falling spacecraft do \"not crash into the Earth fiercely like in sci-fi movies, but turn into a splendid (meteor shower)\". Where will it crash? China confirmed in 2016 that it had lost contact with Tiangong-1 and could no longer control its behaviour, so we don't really know where it will end up. The European Space Agency (ESA) said re-entry \"will take place anywhere between 43ºN and 43ºS\", which covers a vast stretch north and south of the equator. Esa says this means the station could fall anywhere from New Zealand to the midwestern US. How will it crash? The station is gradually coming close to Earth. Its rate of descent \"will continually get faster as the atmosphere that the station is ploughing through gets thicker,\" Dr Elias Aboutanios, deputy director of the Australian Centre for Space Engineering Research, told the BBC. \"The station will eventually start to heat up as it gets close to 100km [from Earth],\" he says. This will lead to most of the station burning up and \"it is difficult to know exactly what will survive since the makeup of the station has not been disclosed by China\". The station could reach speeds of up to 26,000km/h (16,156mph). Should I be worried? No. Most of the 8.5-tonne station will disintegrate as it passes through the atmosphere. Some very dense parts such as the fuel tanks or rocket engines might not burn up completely. However, even if parts do survive to the Earth's surface, the chances of them hitting a person are incredibly slim. \"Our experience is that for such large objects typically between 20% and 40% of the original mass will survive re-entry and then could be found on the ground, theoretically,\" the head of Esa's space debris office, Holger Krag, told reporters at a recent briefing. \"However, to be injured by one of these fragments is extremely unlikely. My estimate is that the probability of being injured by one of these fragments is similar to the probability of being hit by lightning twice in the same year.\" Does all space debris fall to Earth? While debris regularly comes back down, most of it \"burns up or ends up in the middle of the ocean and away from people,\" says Mr Aboutanios. Usually there is still communication with the craft or satellite. That means ground control can still influence its course and steer it to a desired crash site. The debris is steered to crash near what's called the oceanic pole of inaccessibility - the furthest place from land. It's a spot in the South Pacific, between Australia, New Zealand and South America. Over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) this region is a graveyard of spacecraft and satellites, where the remains of around 260 are thought to be scattered on the ocean floor. What is Tiangong-1? China was a late starter when it comes to space exploration. In 2001, China launched space vessels carrying test animals and in 2003 sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US. The programme for a space station kicked off in earnest with the 2011 launch of Tiangong-1, or \"Heavenly Palace\". The small prototype station was able to host astronauts but only for short periods of several days. China's first female astronaut Liu Yang visited in 2012. It ended its service in March 2016, two years later than scheduled. Currently, Tiangong-2 is in operation and by 2022, Beijing plans to have number 3 in orbit as a fully operational manned outpost in space.",

The company added that it will keep its Series 3 model on the market, which will cost $199 - or £199 in the UK - marking a new entry price point for the wearable. Apple currently accounts for 49% of the global smartwatch market, according to research firm IDC. It is also the UK's top-selling smartphone brand by a wide margin. Camera features The new iPhones are notable for introducing an \"ultrawide\" rear camera, offering 2x optical zoom-out. The Pro models retain the telephoto and normal lenses found in the last generation's XS and XS Max, while the basic iPhone 11 only has an ultrawide and standard lens. Apple made a virtue of a new Night Mode, which automatically brightens the image when required while taking steps to minimise the digital noise produced as a result. Google, Samsung and Huawei had already introduced a similar feature to their handsets. A new facility called Deep Fusion was also teased. It takes nine snaps with a variety of exposures and then picks through them \"pixel by pixel\" to combine the best parts from each to create a superior image. This will not, however, be available at launch but should be added via a software update before the year's end. Other enhancements include the ability to shoot slow-motion videos with the front camera. The handsets' processor - the A13 Bionic - has also been upgraded. Apple claims its CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) are more powerful than those featured in any Android phone. In addition, the chip's \"neural engine\" has been optimised to better handle matrix calculations - a type of algebra used by neural networks - and is said to be 20% faster than the A12. However, the new models are not compatible with Apple's Pencil stylus, as had been expected by many. That feature was already offered by its lowest-end iPad. Nor can they wirelessly recharge other devices, unlike Samsung and Huawei's premium phones. The handsets also stick with having lightning ports rather than making the shift to USB-C, as has happened with the iPad Pro - which could have made faster data transfers possible. The iPhone 11 is slightly cheaper than its XR forerunner in the UK, ranging between £729 and £879 depending on the amount of storage. But the Pro models are more expensive than the XS ones, costing between £1,049 and £1,499. They go on sale in 10 days time. Slowing demand Apple experienced a bigger drop in demand for new handsets than many of its rivals over the past year. But the firm recently reported that its active install base - the number of iPhones in use - was at an \"all time high\". \"Several forces play here,\" commented Marta Pinto from IDC. \"Apple designs devices that last longer than an average Android device, and it's been very good at rolling out new versions of its operating system. \"There's also a very good second-hand trade in iPhones, and the overall smartphone market is slowing down. \"But Apple doesn't mind because its focus is now turning to services, and its wearables are also doing well.\" The new iPhone line-up does not feature a 5G model, in part because Intel struggled to develop the required modem. At a time when consumers are holding onto their handsets for longer before upgrading, that could place a further constraint on sales - especially in countries where 5G networks have already launched, such as the UK. \"Given people's loyalty to iPhone, if they really want 5G they'll probably just wait,\" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. \"That said, don't be surprised to see rivals, particularly Samsung, positioning 5G devices as 'future-proof' options. \"I'm sure they will be arguing that buying a premium priced 4G smartphone right now would be like buying a TV a few years ago that was not HD-Ready.\" Subscription services Earlier at the event, chief executive Tim Cook revealed that Apple's two forthcoming subscription services would each cost $4.99 - or £4.99 in the UK - per month. Apple Arcade - a video games deal offering exclusive access to games that do not feature in-app fees - will become available on 19 September. It will be followed by Apple TV+ - a television programme and movie-streaming platform with content not available elsewhere - which will make its first shows available on 1 November. The latter will be cheaper than rival services from Disney and Netflix, but appears to promise less material at this stage. \"I applaud web access to Apple TV+, but would have preferred an Android and Windows app,\" commented Mr Moorhead. There was no mention of Apple bundling the new services with its existing cloud storage, news and music offerings for a discount, as had been speculated. But it will offer one year's Apple TV+ membership to consumers buying one of its computers or set-top boxes. In addition, the company unveiled a new iPad. The seventh generation model has a 10.2in (25.9cm) screen - making it bigger than before - and will go on sale at the end of the month. It will start at £349, a £30 increase on the earlier model. It has now been nearly 13 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone. Apple has since become one of the world's most valuable companies, in part because of investors' hopes that it can pull off a similar trick. \"Everyone wants Apple to have a new 'wow' product and its got a pretty good track record,\" commented Mr Wood. \"But the next big hit is proving elusive right now. My money is still on smart glasses but I think it could still be years before we see anything.\" These updates are less about bringing in new features, but enhancing the things we're already familiar with. The iPhone Pro's camera setup is being aimed at - as you might guess - professionals. I think Apple sees big potential in indie filmmakers and documentary-makers. The battery-life bump should also help. Apple TV+ is cheap compared to its competitors. But is it good value? Disney+, Netflix, HBO et al have huge back catalogues of loved TV shows and movies. Apple doesn't, or at least it's not clear what it will have, even one year from now. All Apple really has is a boatload of cash to fill up Apple TV+ with content it hopes people will like. We've seen no evidence, yet, that it's capable of fulfilling that goal. Giving one year's access away with new devices is a way of making sure those new shows have wide exposure - but it needs to convince the entertainment industry that it's worth making a show for Apple+ instead of its rivals. How phone cameras evolved: Kyocera VP-210 VisualPhone (1999) Although there is some dispute over which mobile first featured a built-in colour camera, many credit this handset as having the honour. It featured a 0.11 megapixel (MP) sensor and could only store 20 selfies, but was able to transmit a jerky video feed in real-time at about two frames per second. Sharp J-SH04 (2000) Sharp's first photo-snapping mobile placed its sensor on the rear of its handset to encourage its use as an alternative to standard cameras. Its 0.11MP snaps could then be sent to friends via email. Sony Ericsson T68i (2002) The handset's optional CommuniCam MCA-20 accessory snapped on to the bottom of the handset, helping keep down the phone's size when not in use. It was limited to taking VGA (0.3MP) resolution shots, but the images could be texted to others via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) if they had compatible phones. Samsung D500 (2004) This was one of the first handsets to offer more than one megapixel of image quality. What's more it had a flash. Meanwhile the software made it possible to add graphical frames around photos and turn images sepia or apply a \"negative\" effect. Nokia N90 (2005) Nokia's N90 had a somewhat clunky swivel design, but a two megapixel sensor and a lens developed in collaboration with the famed German optics firm Carl Zeiss pitched it firmly at camera enthusiasts. Samsung G800 (2007) The megapixel wars were well under way by the time Samsung unveiled the G800. It took 5MP shots, had a 3x optical zoom and even featured a lens-cover slider, meaning that from the rear it could be easily mistaken for a dedicated camera. iPhone 4 (2010) Apple's fourth-generation iPhone is widely credited with helping kickstart the selfie craze, despite being far from the first to have a front camera. But at its launch, Steve Jobs was keener to show off how the feature could be used for Facetime, the firm's video chat app. LG Optimus 3D (2011) Smartphones with two rear cameras were still a rarity when LG's Android phone went on sale. It used them to create 3D images that could be viewed without special glasses on its display. But 3D phones proved to be as unpopular as 3D TVs, marking an evolutionary dead end for the industry. HTC One (2013) HTC's 2013 flagship sought to shift the battle to low-light photography. To do this it made the pixels larger than normal to gather more light, and dubbed them \"ultrapixels\". The trade-off was that its photos were limited to 4MP. Nokia Lumia 1020 (2014) This Windows Phone featured an industry-leading 41MP sensor attached to an optical image stabilisation system. It allowed users to zoom in and crop without worrying about images becoming blurred, or to combine the data to make 5MP photos with less visual noise than would otherwise be the case. Lenovo Phab2Pro (2016) This was the first handset to build in Google's doomed Project Tango depth and motion-sensing cameras. They made augmented reality features possible, such as superimposing graphical images of furniture into views of a room. Tango was short-lived, but AR has lived on by other means. Samsung Note 8 (2017) This was one of the first phones to feature \"live focus\" - a facility that allowed users to adjust background blur in their photos before or after taking them. It achieved this by comparing the view from each of its two rear cameras to create a depth map of the scene. iPhone X (2017) Apple's tenth anniversary handset introduced its Face ID camera system, which used tens of thousands of infrared dots to map the user's features. As a consequence, the display had to make space for a \"notch\", which was widely copied by rivals even if they didn't feature such an elaborate facial recognition system. Pixel 2 (2017) Google found a way to let users blur the background of their photos using a single camera in its second-generation Pixel. This made it possible to offer the effect from both its front-facing selfie camera as well as the rear sensor. Huawei P20 Pro (2018) The Chinese firm's phone was one of the first to feature three cameras on its back. But the standout feature was its ability to produce quality snaps in near-dark conditions by taking long-exposure snaps and then using machine learning software to keep the details crisp. Oppo Reno 10x Zoom (2019) This had two unusual camera features. Firstly, one of the rear cameras has a periscope design that directs light sideways into the device's body, making it possible to let users zoom into a shot more than usual without sacrificing detail. Secondly, the selfie camera pops up from the top, making more space for the display.",

    "text": "\"Despite the magnitude of the efforts made, it has not been possible to locate the submarine,\" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday. The sub, the ARA San Juan, last made contact on Wednesday 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors faded after a suspected explosion was heard near its last-known location. Why has the navy made this decision? Capt Balbi said the search for the submarine had been \"extended to more than double the number of days that determine the possibilities of rescuing the crew\". His comment refers to the estimated period that it is thought the crew could have survived in the submerged vessel. Capt Balbi said that the navy was not able to confirm the fate of the crew, and no evidence of a shipwreck was found in the search area. He said that the search operation, involving numerous vessels and other submarines, was now a hunt for a wreck on the seabed in the area where the ARA San Juan is believed to have vanished. How have the crew's relatives reacted? At the Mar Del Plata naval base, both relatives and naval colleagues of those missing broke down upon hearing the news, reported La Nación newspaper, with doctors rushing to the aid of the most distraught. Many relatives urged authorities to continue searching vigorously. \"We want them to keep looking, to find the bodies, we need this to begin grieving,\" said Yolanda Mendiola, mother of Petty Officer Leandro Cisneros. Some angrily accused authorities of allowing them to learn the news from the television, and of wanting to \"leave the kids lying in the middle of the sea\". Others held prayer groups and expressed hope that the crew might still be found alive. Some voiced suspicion. \"I want to know what happened and I do not believe in any of the official hypotheses,\" Luis Tagliapietra, whose son was on board, told the TN news channel. \"I have no words for it,\" she said. What happened to the sub? The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an \"electrical breakdown\". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a \"short circuit\" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. On Tuesday, Capt Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared. Who was on board? The submarine, with its 44 crew, set off under the command of Pedro Martín Fernández. Forty-three of the crew were men but there was also one woman, Eliana María Krawczyk. The 35-year-old was the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. The rest of the crew were submariners of varying ages and experience. Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine? The sub's engineer, Hernán Rodríguez, had been working with the ARA San Juan for 11 years. An international search mission has seen the deployment of 4,000 personnel from more than a dozen countries. Argentine President Mauricio Macri has ordered a probe into the sub's disappearance.",

    "text": "The countries, which form the Five Eyes alliance, criticised China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. They urged Beijing to reverse course. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded that if countries \"dared harm China's sovereignty, they should beware that their eyes could be blinded\". \"The Chinese never stir trouble , but they aren't afraid of trouble either,\" Zhao Lijian told journalists in Beijing on Thursday, saying it did not \"matter if they had five or 10 eyes\". Last week, Hong Kong expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers from its legislature after Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. In response, all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced their resignation. For the first time since the UK handed the territory back to China in 1997, the body has almost no dissenting voices. The dismissal of the four lawmakers was viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms, something Beijing denies. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes group urged China to reinstate them, saying the move was a clear breach of Beijing's legally binding commitments to protect the territory's freedoms and autonomy. They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the five Anglophone countries set up during the Cold War and initially developed to monitor the USSR and its allies. Tension over Hong Kong's national security law Earlier, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said any attempt by foreign states to threaten or pressure Beijing to make concessions was \"doomed to fail\". Hong Kong was returned to China under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises \"secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces\". Beijing says the law will return stability to the territory, but western governments and human rights groups say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. Earlier this month, a reporter who helped investigate suspected police involvement in a violent attack on protesters last year was arrested, in what journalists said was a tactic to discourage reporting. In response to the security law, the UK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) status a route to British citizenship. Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one. China last month strongly criticised the UK in response, telling London to \"immediately correct its mistakes\". More about China-Hong Kong tensions",

    "text": "The reusable Blue Moon vehicle will carry scientific instruments, satellites and rovers. It will feature a new rocket engine called BE-7 that can blast 10,000lb (4,535kg) of thrust. \"It's time to go back to the Moon, this time to stay,\" said Mr Bezos. Mr Bezos presented the Moon goals of his space exploration company Blue Origin at the Washington Convention Center in Washington DC, to an audience consisting of potential customers and officials from Nasa. The Blue Moon lunar lander comes loaded with enough fuel to get from Earth to the Moon. It can deliver payloads to the lunar surface, deploy up to four self-driving rovers, and launch satellites to orbit the Moon. A pressurised vehicle for humans is also envisaged. Blue Moon will weigh 33,000lb when loaded with fuel on lift-off from Earth, which will decrease to about 7,000lb when it is about to land on the Moon. The aim is for Blue Moon to land on the south pole of the Moon, where ice deposits have been found in craters. The water derived from that ice can be broken down to produce hydrogen, which could then fuel up the spacecraft for further missions across the solar system. In March, the Trump administration announced that it intended to return US astronauts to the Moon by the end of 2024. In his speech, Mr Bezos said that Blue Origin would be able to meet Trump's deadline, but \"only because\" the firm had begun designing the lunar lander in 2016. Mr Bezos wanted to improve access to the Moon, because he has a wider vision of a future where people are able to live and work in space, which is not possible today. \"The price of admission to do interesting things in space right now is just too high because there's no infrastructure,\" he said. To illustrate this, he showed pictures of self-sustaining space colonies that could support people, animals and greenery - somewhat similar to the concepts developed by Princeton physicist Gerard O'Neill.",

    "text": "\"The war in Yemen must end,\" President Joe Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. Under Mr Biden's two predecessors, the US backed a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. Fighting began in 2014 between a weak Yemeni government and the Houthi rebel movement. It escalated a year later, when Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states - backed by the US, the UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis. Mr Biden announced other changes to US foreign policy, such as a significant increase in the number of refugees accepted by the US. His speech marks a sharp break with the policies of former President Donald Trump, who left office last month. On Russia, for instance, the new US leader said: \"I made it clear to President [Vladimir] Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions… are over.\" The comments drew fierce criticism from the Kremlin. \"This is very aggressive, unconstructive rhetoric, to our regret,\" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. What does the Yemen announcement mean? The US has been backing the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led allies in their war against the Houthis. As a result of Thursday's announcement, the US will stop supporting offensive operations, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This will not affect operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Biden administration had already put a temporary halt on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Mr Biden is expected to name his new Yemen envoy as Tim Lenderking, an experienced diplomat and Middle East specialist. This marks a change of tack from Mr Trump's administration, which increased support for the Saudi-led coalition. Last month Mr Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced that the Houthis were being designated a \"terrorist organisation\". He said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks and deter \"malign activity\" by their backer Iran. Aid organisations criticised the move, warning that it could prevent them from operating in areas where millions are in urgent need of food aid. Last week, the Biden administration said it would exempt certain transactions involving the Houthis from sanctions. That exemption will expire on 26 February. The United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection. These announcements confirm President Biden's pledge to end Yemen's destructive war. Halting US support to the Saudi-led coalition's offensive operations won't close this bloody chapter, but it sends a strong signal to leaders in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - they've also been trying to find ways to extricate themselves from this quagmire. Achieving peace among Yemen's bitter enemies will be a monumental challenge. Tim Lenderking is set to be the first US envoy for Yemen since this war was unleashed nearly six years ago. He's worked on this file for years and is known to everyone who matters. Western diplomats, as well as Yemenis, have welcomed this new US engagement. In 2015, President Obama gave a green light to the Saudi-led campaign, partly to ease the Kingdom's anger over the Iran nuclear deal. Now new US envoys on Yemen, and Iran, are tasked with ending this war, and the regional rivalries which still fuel it. What else did Biden say? The US will raise the cap on refugee admissions from 15,000 to 125,000 for the fiscal year. The withdrawal of US troops from Germany will be frozen and forces will remain at their current level of about 36,000. Under Mr Trump, the US was going to reduce its presence by 12,000, with about 5,600 to be deployed elsewhere in Europe. Mr Biden called on Myanmar's military rulers to release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy. He also promised to engage diplomatically with Russia but to be tougher on Moscow than Mr Trump, saying the US would not \"roll over\".",

It has been winched to the surface so a platform can be inserted under it for it to be towed ashore. It is expected to arrive at port in less than two weeks, where it will be met by the families of victims. The bodies of nine victims are believed to still be trapped inside the sunken ship, and raising it was one of the central demands of their families.

The sinking was blamed on a combination of illegal redesigns, cargo overloading, the inexperience of the crew member steering the vessel, and lax government regulations.

    "text": "He will leave the role next month after he fulfils \"outstanding commitments\", a source close to Mr Blair told the BBC. Mr Blair, who took the role just hours after leaving Downing Street in 2007, has written to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to confirm his decision. He will \"remain active\" in the region in an informal role, the source said. Mr Blair remains \"fully committed to assisting the international community in its work with Israel and the Palestinians to bring about progress on the two-state solution\", they said. \"He believes that he can best support these efforts through working with the key regional players, the USA, the EU and others, without any formal role.\" Analysis By Kevin Connolly, BBC Middle East correspondent No-one is going to consider Tony Blair's period as Quartet envoy a resounding success. But it can't be written off as a failure either, largely because of the mandate he was given. The role came with considerable media fanfare, but in truth they were big headlines heralding a modest set of responsibilities. It was the envoy's job to bring economic development to Palestinian areas, and there were some successes on improving freedom of movement and mobile phone services. But everyone knows some sort of political progress has to come - stability, if not a proper deal - before the Palestinian economy can really flourish. That never came on Mr Blair's watch. But it wasn't his remit either. Some felt he was too comfortable with the Israelis and that the Palestinians never felt he put in enough hours at the job. His time may not be ending gloriously but it is difficult to hold Mr Blair to account for failure in a region where very few international diplomats have succeeded. Although he did contribute to the political process, Mr Blair felt the post was \"limited\" to supporting the Palestinian people on economic development and strengthening institutions, the source said. But despite the \"political constraints\" of the position, Mr Blair believes \"much has been achieved\" over the last eight years. The former Labour prime minister feels an \"entirely new approach\" is required to find a two-state solution, the source added. Mr Blair will now \"concentrate on strengthening relations between Israel and the wider Arab world\", which he believes could help \"underpin international efforts to end the ongoing impasse in the peace process\". 'Hope draining away' \"He will also focus on encouraging Israel to take measures which will dramatically improve the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza,\" the source said \"He believes that achieving this progress on the ground is an essential prerequisite to strengthening broader Arab-Israeli relations.\" James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent, said Mr Blair's time in the role had coincided with \"hope draining away throughout the Middle East peace process\". He said the Quartet of powers was now likely to examine its own role in the peace process - as well as the future role of another possible envoy. \"So little has been achieved - arguably nothing has been achieved - in the Israel-Palestine process in the past decade and more, so I think if the Quartet examines its own usefulness it will certainly think twice before rushing to have a new envoy,\" our correspondent added.",

    "text": "Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 \"was not manmade or genetically modified\". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. What did Trump say? At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: \"Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?\" \"Yes, I have. Yes, I have,\" said the president, without specifying. \"And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.\" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: \"I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.\" He also told reporters: \"Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? \"I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.\" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News. What did the intelligence service say? In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the \"wide scientific consensus\" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. \"The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. What is the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. What are Trump's accusations against China? Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before? In January, he called US intelligence agencies \"naive\" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens. The right moment for this fight? President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.",

    "text": "Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter The final report has been submitted to the UN Security Council, and is likely to be published later this week. Singapore's government said it was aware of the cases and had begun investigating where there was \"credible information\" of possible offences. Both the UN and Singapore ban the sale of luxury goods to North Korea. Global sanctions against North Korea have tightened considerably over the last two years as Pyongyang has continued to conduct nuclear tests and launch missiles. Despite the recent development that unprecedented talks between North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump may take place later this year, UN sanctions against North Korea will remain in place. Analysts say the alleged violations by Singapore companies, if proven, raise questions about how widespread such breaches might be across Asia. Who's been named in the UN report? The leaked UN report highlights two Singapore-based firms, among others in Asia. It alleges the two firms supplied a range of luxury goods to North Korea, including wines and spirits, until as recently as July 2017. Under UN Sanctions, it has been illegal to sell luxury items to North Korea since 2006. And Singapore's laws have banned the sale of these items to North Korea for several years. The two Singapore-based firms under investigation are OCN and T Specialist. They are sister companies and share the same director. Both the companies have denied any wrongdoing. The UN report also claims between 2011 and 2014 \"transactions valued at more than $2m (£1.4m)\" - allegedly proceeds from the sale of goods in North Korea - flowed from an account that OCN and T Specialist set up in a North Korean bank, Daedong Credit Bank, to T Specialist's bank accounts in Singapore. Singapore has banned its financial institutions from providing financial assistance or services for facilitating any trade with North Korea, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. T Specialist has testified to the UN that the funds did not come from North Korea but a company registered in Hong Kong, and related to sales before 2012. The two companies are also accused by the UN of having \"long-standing, close ties\" - including ownership ties - with Ryugyong Commercial Bank, a bank the US put on its sanctions list in 2017. The Singaporean companies said they have no interests in the bank. Their lawyer, Edmond Pereira, has confirmed they are under investigation by Singapore authorities, but insisted they did not have any current financial links, interests, or any sort of relationship with entities in North Korea. Mr Pereira acknowledged that his clients \"have done business with North Korean entities... before the UN sanctions came into force\". He added the companies had \"reduced their involvement\" in North Korea but that \"these things take a bit of time\". Lawyers have said part of the problem is these sanctions are expected to be enforced by companies who are often unaware of the changes in the law. Singapore-North Korea trade It was only in November last year that Singapore banned trade with North Korea entirely. Before that, some trade was allowed. The UN report claims some of the transactions in the OCN and T Specialist cases appear to have used the Singapore financial system. It also said it was the responsibility of member countries to make sure their banks had a more \"robust scrutiny\" of individuals and companies opening accounts with them. The BBC contacted the two Singapore banks mentioned in the report. Both banks declined to comment, citing Singapore's banking secrecy laws. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told the BBC it was working closely with the UN on these cases. \"MAS will take stern action against any financial institutions in breach of regulations relating to proliferation financing,\" MAS said in a statement sent to the BBC. The authority also said it expected banks to be aware of \"the use of multi-jurisdictional front companies, shell companies, joint ventures, and complex or opaque ownership structures\". Difficult for banks to catch William Newcomb, a former member on the UN Panel of Experts, said it was precisely these financial loopholes North Korea seeks to exploit. \"What they will do is set up a shell company, then establish a company in another location, a bank in a third location, and do business in another location,\" he explained. \"And now you have multiple jurisdictions involved. So it becomes quite complicated, and it's one of the techniques they use to defeat the sanctions.\" Financial crime researchers say it is difficult for banks to catch this sort of behaviour. \"You would probably never know that the funds were coming from North Korea,\" said Tim Phillipps, Asia Pacific Leader for Deloitte's Financial Crime Network. He added the problem could be much bigger across South East Asia. \"If you're named in a report in this environment in Singapore, the MAS are highly likely to demand extensive transaction history examination. \"But if you start to look across the other countries in South East Asia, they generally haven't got the maturity of systems to prevent this.\" The UN report highlights how easily entities allegedly doing business with North Korea might potentially find loopholes to use - even in sophisticated financial systems like Singapore's.",

    "text": "However the court found five other men guilty of murder and rioting. More than 3,000 Sikhs were killed in retaliation for the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two of her Sikh bodyguards. India's top investigating agency had accused Mr Kumar of inciting crowds to kill Sikhs in Delhi's Cantonment area. He has always denied charges of being involved in the killing of six people in the Cantonment - or military area - during riots that were sparked by the shooting of Mrs Gandhi. Reports said a Sikh protester in the courtroom hurled a shoe at the judge after the verdict was pronounced. He was taken into custody. Relatives of the victims, who were present outside the court at the time of Tuesday's ruling, said they were disappointed and would appeal against the acquittal. Reports said many of them broke down and some argued with police. Sikh groups have called it a \"black day in India's history\". Mr Kumar's lawyer, IU Khan, called the case an example of \"malicious prosecution\". \"It appears to be a case of no evidence,\" he told CNN-IBN. Mr Khan said that Mr Kumar is facing at least one other case in connection with the riots. Last year, the Central Bureau of Investigation told the court they had found \"credible evidence\" that some Congress party leaders incited crowds to attack Sikhs during the riots. Witnesses at the scene said that they heard Sajjan Kumar tell a crowd that \"not a single Sikh should survive\", the CBI had said.",

    "text": "By The Visual and Data Journalism TeamBBC News The northern states of Roraima, Acre, Rondônia and Amazonas have been particularly badly affected. Huge fires have also been burning across the border in Bolivia, devastating swaths of the country's tropical forest and savannah. So what's happening exactly and how bad are the fires? There have been a lot of fires this year Brazil - home to more than half the Amazon rainforest - has seen a high number of fires in 2019, Brazilian space agency data suggests. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) says its satellite data shows an 76% increase on the same period in 2018. The official figures show more than 87,000 forest fires were recorded in Brazil in the first eight months of the year - the highest number since 2010. That compares with 49,000 in the same period in 2018. Nasa, which provides Inpe with its active fire data, confirmed recordings from its satellite sensors also indicated 2019 had been the most active year for almost a decade. However, 2019 is not the worst year in recent history. Brazil experienced more fire activity in the 2000s - with 2005 seeing more than 142,000 fires in the first eight months of the year. Forest fires are common in the Amazon during the dry season, which runs from July to October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, such as lightning strikes, but this year most are believed to have been started by farmers and loggers clearing land for crops or grazing. There had been a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon, said Douglas Morton, head of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center. The timing and location of the fires were more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought, he added. Activists say the anti-environment rhetoric of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has encouraged such tree-clearing activities since he came into power in January. In response to criticism at home and abroad, Mr Bolsonaro announced he was banning setting fires to clear land for 60 days. The president has also accepted an offer of four planes to fight the fires from the Chilean government and has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. However, he has refused a G7 offer of $22m (£18m) following a dispute with French President Emmanuel Macron. The north of Brazil has been badly affected Most of the worst-affected regions are in the north of the country. Roraima, Acre, Rondônia and Amazonas all saw a large percentage increase in fires when compared with the average across the last four years (2015-2018). Roraima saw a 141% increase, Acre 138%, Rondônia 115% and Amazonas 81%. Mato Grosso do Sul, further south, saw a 114% increase. Amazonas, the largest state in Brazil, has declared a state of emergency. Deliberate deforestation? The recent increase in the number of fires in the Amazon is directly related to intentional deforestation and not the result of an extremely dry season, according to the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam). Ipam's director Ane Alencar said fires were often used as a way of clearing land for cattle ranches after deforesting operations. \"They cut the trees, leave the wood to dry and later put fire to it, so that the ashes can fertilise the soil,\" she told the Mongabay website. While the exact scale of deforestation in the rainforest will only be certain when 2019 figures are published at the end of the year, preliminary data suggests there has been a significant rise already this year. Monthly data shows the scale of the areas cleared has been creeping up since January, but with a spike in July this year - almost 278% higher than in July 2018, according to Inpe. Inpe tracks suspected deforestation in real-time using satellite data, sending out alerts to flag areas that may have been cleared. More than 10,000 alerts were sent out in July alone. The record number of fires also coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations, BBC analysis has found. The fires are emitting large amounts of smoke and carbon Plumes of smoke from the fires have spread across the Amazon region and beyond. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams), a part of the European Union's Earth observation programme, the smoke has been travelling as far as the Atlantic coast. The fires have been releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of 228 megatonnes so far this year, according to Cams, the highest since 2010. They are also emitting carbon monoxide - a gas released when wood is burned and does not have much access to oxygen. Maps from Cams show this carbon monoxide - a pollutant that is toxic at high levels - being carried beyond South America's coastlines. The Amazon basin - home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people - is crucial to regulating global warming, with its forests absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. But when trees are cut or burned, the carbon they are storing is released into the atmosphere and the rainforest's capacity to absorb carbon is reduced. There were more fires in the mid-2000s While the number of fires in Brazil is at its highest level for almost a decade, the data suggests that Brazil - and the wider Amazon region - has experienced more intense burning in the past. An analysis of Nasa satellite data this month indicated that the total fire activity in 2019 across the Amazon, not just Brazil, is close to the average when compared with a longer 15 year period. Figures from Brazil's Inpe, dating back to 1998, also show the country suffered worse periods of fire activity in the 2000s. Reports in mid-August, including on the BBC, had said there were a record number of fires in Brazil this year. Inpe has since made more data easily accessible, showing how far back its records stretched. We have now amended our reports to reflect this information. Inpe's historic figures are backed by numbers from Cams, which show total CO2 equivalent emissions - used to measure of the amount and intensity of fire activity - were also higher in Brazil the mid-2000s. Other countries have also been affected A number of other countries in the Amazon basin - an area spanning 7.4m sq km (2.9m sq miles) - have also seen a high number of fires this year. Venezuela has experienced the second-highest number, with more than 26,000 fires, with Bolivia coming in third, with more than 19,000. This is a rise of 79% on last year. Peru, in fifth place, has seen a rise of 92%. The size of the fires in Bolivia is estimated to have doubled since late last week. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles - are affected. Bolivia has hired a Boeing 747 \"supertanker\" from the US to drop water, and accepted an offer of aid from G7 leaders. Extra emergency workers have also been sent to the region, and sanctuaries are being set up for animals escaping the flames. South American countries are planning to meet in the Colombian city of Leticia next week to discuss a co-ordinated response to the fires.
